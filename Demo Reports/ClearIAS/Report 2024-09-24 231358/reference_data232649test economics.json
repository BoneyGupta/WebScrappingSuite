These processes are driven by forces originating within the Earth (endogenic processes) or from external sources (exogenic processes). Read here to learn more.\n\nIt is time to know in detail about the surface of the earth on which we live. We know that the surface of the earth is not a plain platform. It is distributed unevenly with a variety of landforms like mountains, hills, plateaus, plains, ravines, cliffs etc.\n\nWhy is the surface of the earth uneven? What makes changes in the earth\u2019s surface? What process makes mountains and hills?

This energy is mostly generated by radioactivity, rotational and tidal friction and primordial heat from the origin of the earth.\n\nThese are internal processes that derive their energy from within the Earth, mainly from tectonic and volcanic activity.\n\nTectonic Processes:\n\nFolding: When Earth\u2019s crust is compressed, it bends and forms folds, leading to the creation of mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas.\nFaulting: When the crust is subjected to stress, it may fracture, creating faults. Movements along these faults can result in earthquakes, forming rift valleys or blocking mountains.\nVolcanism: The movement of molten rock (magma) from beneath the Earth\u2019s surface to above it, leading to the formation of volcanic landforms like volcanoes, lava plateaus, and volcanic islands.\n\nAlso read: Marginal seas of the world\n\nExogenic Forces\n\nExogenic forces can take the form of weathering, erosion, and deposition. Weathering is the breaking of rocks on the earth\u2019s surface by different agents like rivers, wind, sea waves and glaciers. Erosion is the carrying of broken rocks from one place to another by natural agents like wind, water, and glaciers.\n\nThe actions of exogenic forces result in wearing down (degradation) of relief/elevations and filling up (aggradation) of basins/ depressions, on the earth\u2019s surface. The phenomenon of wearing down of relief variations of the surface of the earth through erosion is known as gradation.\n\nThese are external processes driven by forces like gravity, water, wind, and ice, which gradually wear down the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nWeathering:\nPhysical Weathering: The mechanical breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces without changing their chemical composition, often due to temperature changes (freeze-thaw cycles), pressure release, or biological activity.\nChemical Weathering: The decomposition of rocks due to chemical reactions, often involving water, acids, or gases. This process leads to the formation of features like karst landscapes (e.g., limestone caves).\nBiological Weathering: The breakdown of rocks by living organisms, such as plants and microbes, which can accelerate both physical and chemical weathering processes.\nErosion: The process of wearing away and transporting rock material by natural agents like water, wind, ice, and gravity.\nFluvial Erosion: Erosion caused by rivers and streams, leading to the formation of valleys, canyons, and deltas.\nAeolian Erosion: Wind-driven erosion, which shapes features like dunes and desert pavements.\nGlacial Erosion: The movement of glaciers erodes the underlying rock, creating U-shaped valleys, fjords, and moraines.\nMass Wasting: The movement of rock and soil downslope under the influence of gravity, including landslides, rockfalls, and debris flows.\nDeposition: The accumulation of sediment in new locations, creating landforms such as deltas, alluvial fans, dunes, and glacial moraines.\nOther geomorphic processes\nCoastal Processes\nWave Action: The continuous impact of ocean waves erodes coastlines, forming features like cliffs, arches, and sea stacks.\nTides and Currents: These influence the deposition of sediments along coastlines, leading to the formation of beaches, spits, and barrier islands.\nFluvial Processes\nRiver Action: Rivers play a crucial role in shaping landscapes by eroding, transporting, and depositing sediments, which leads to the formation of valleys, floodplains, meanders, and oxbow lakes.\nGlacial Processes\nGlacial Movement: Glaciers erode the landscape through plucking and abrasion, carving out deep valleys and shaping mountain ranges. The deposition of glacial till creates landforms such as drumlins, eskers, and terminal moraines.\nWind Processes (Aeolian Processes)\nWind Erosion: Wind picks up and transports fine particles, leading to the formation of landforms like dunes and loess plains.\nBiotic Processes\nVegetation and Animals: The roots of plants and the activities of animals contribute to the breakdown of rocks and the stabilization of soil, influencing erosion and deposition.\nGeomorphic Processes vs Geomorphic Agents\n\nGeomorphic agents are natural forces that drive the processes of weathering, erosion, transportation, and deposition, which collectively shape the Earth\u2019s surface over time.\n\nThese agents play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of landscapes, and they can be classified into several categories based on their nature and effects.\n\nThese geomorphic agents interact with each other, and their combined effects are responsible for the continuous reshaping of the Earth\u2019s surface, creating diverse landscapes across the planet.\n\nEarth Movements\nThey are the movements in the earth\u2019s crust caused by endogenic or exogenic forces. These movements are also termed as Tectonic movements.\nThe term \u2018Tectonic\u2019 is derived from the Greek word \u2018Tekton\u2019 which means builders.\nAs the word means, these movements are mainly builders and have been responsible for building up different types of landforms.\n\nNext in the series:\u00a0Endogenic Forces and Evolution of Land Forms.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

We also know that endogenic forces (internal) and exogenic forces (external) are the two main types of geomorphic processes which results in earth movements. In this post, let\u2019s study endogenic forces in detail.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEndogenic Forces \u2013 Internal forces in detail\nSlow Movements (Diastrophic forces)\nVertical Movements (Epeirogenic movements):\nHorizontal Movements (Orogenic Movements):\nForces of Compression:\nForces of Tension:\nSudden Movements\nEndogenic Forces \u2013 Internal forces in detail\n\nEndogenic forces a can be classified as slow movements (diastrophic) and sudden movements.\u00a0Slow movements cause changes very gradually which might not be visible during a human lifetime.\n\nSlow Movements (Diastrophic forces)\n\nDiastrophic forces refer to forces generated by the movement of the solid material of the earth\u2019s crust. All the processes that move, elevate or build portions of the earth\u2019s crust come under diastrophism. Diastrophism includes:\n\norogenic processes involving mountain building through severe folding and affecting long and narrow belts of the earth\u2019s crust.\nepeirogenic processes involving uplift or warping of large parts of the earth\u2019s crust.\nearthquakes involving local relatively minor movements.\nplate tectonics involving horizontal movements of crustal plates.\n\nSlow movements can again be classified as vertical movements and horizontal movements.\n\nVertical Movements (Epeirogenic movements):\nVertical\u00a0movements are mainly associated with the formation of continents and plateaus. They are also called as Epeirogenic movements\nThe broad central parts of continents are called cratons and are subject to epeirogeny.\nThey do not bring any changes in the horizontal rock strata.\nWhile they cause upliftment of continent, they can also cause subsidence of continent.\nThese movements are originated from the centre of the earth.\nHorizontal Movements (Orogenic Movements):\nHorizontal\u00a0forces acts on the earth\u2019s crust from side to side to cause these movements.\nThey are also known as orogenic movements (mountain building).\nThey bring a lot of disruptions to the horizontal layer of strata leading to a large structural deformation of earth\u2019s crust.\nThey can be classified as forces of compression and forces of tension.\nForces of Compression:\n\nForces of compression\u00a0are the forces which push\u00a0rock strata against a hard plane from one side or from both sides.\nThe compressional forces lead to the bending of rock layers and thus lead to the formation of Fold Mountains.\nMost of the great mountain chains of the world like the Himalayas, the Rockies (N. America), the Andes (S. America), the Alps (Europe) etc are formed in this manner.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nForces of Tension:\n\nForces of tension\u00a0work horizontally, but in opposite directions.\nUnder the operation of intense tensional forces, the rock stratum gets\u00a0broken or fractured which results in the formation of cracks and fractures in the crust.\nThe displacement of rock upward or downward from their original position along such a fracture is termed as faulting.\nThe line along which displacement of the fractured rock strata take place is called as the fault line.\nFaulting results in the formation of well-known relief features such as Rift Valleys and Block Mountains. (E.g. Vindhya and Satpura Mountains)\nA rift valley is formed by sinking of rock strata lying between two almost parallel faults. (E.g. Valley of Nile, Rift valley of Narmada and Tapti )\nRift valleys with steep parallel walls along the fault are called as Graben and the uplifted landmass with steep slopes on both sides are called as Horst.\nThe very steep slope in a continuous line along a fault is termed as\u00a0Escarpment.\n\nSudden Movements\n\nExamples:\u00a0Volcanoes and earth quakes.\n\nNext article in the series:\u00a0Volcanoes: Everything You Need To Know.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudharashan",

A weaker zone of the mantle called asthenosphere, usually is the source of magma.\nOnce this magma came out to the earth surface through the vent of a volcano, it is called as the Lava. Therefore, Lava is nothing but the magma on earth surface.\nThe process by which solid, liquid and gaseous material escape from the earth\u2019s interior to the surface of the earth is called as Volcanism.\nTypes of Volcanoes\n\nVolcanoes are classified on the basis of nature of eruption and the form developed at the surface.\n\nShield Volcanoes\nHow to identify: They are not very steep but are far and wider. They extend to great height as well as distance.\nThey are the largest of all volcanoes in the world as the lava flows to a far distance. The Hawaiian volcanoes are the most famous examples.\nShield volcanoes have low slopes and consist almost entirely of frozen lavas.\nIf you were to fly over top of a shield volcano, it would resemble a warrior\u2019s shield, hence the name.\nThese volcanoes are mostly made up of basalt (less viscous), a type of lava that is very fluid when erupted.\u00a0For this reason, these volcanoes are not steep.\nThey are of low explosive in general, but if somehow water gets into the vent they may turn explosive.\nThe upcoming lava moves in the form of a fountain and throws out the cone at the top of the vent and develops into cinder cone\nCinder Cone Volcanoes:\nCinders are extrusive igneous rocks. A more modern name for cinder\u00a0is Scoria.\nSmall volcanoes.\nThese volcanoes consist almost entirely of loose, grainy cinders and almost no lava.\nThey have very steep sides and usually have a small crater on top.\nComposite Volcanoes:\nShape: Cone shaped with\u00a0moderately steep sides and sometimes have small craters in their summits.\nVolcanologists call these \u201cstrato-\u201d or composite volcanoes because they consist of layers of solid lava flows mixed with layers of sand- or gravel-like volcanic rock called cinders or volcanic ash.\nThey are characterized by the eruption of a cooler and more viscous lavas than basalt.\nThese volcanoes often result in explosive eruptions.\nAlong with lava, large quantities of pyroclastic materials and ashes find their way to the ground.\nThis material accumulates in the vicinity of the vent openings and leading to the formation of layers, and this makes the mount appears as composite volcanoes.\nCaldera:\nThese are the most explosive of the earth\u2019s volcanoes.\nThey are usually so explosive that when they erupt they tend to collapse on themselves rather than building any tall structure. The collapsed depressions are called calderas.\nTheir explosiveness indicates that its magma chamber is large and in close vicinity.\nA caldera differs from a crater in such a way that a caldera is a huge depression caused by a collapse after a large-scale eruption, whereas a crater is a small, steep side, volcanic depression bored out by an eruptive plume.\nFlood Basalt Provinces\nThese volcanoes outpour highly fluid lava that flows for long distances.\nThe Deccan Traps from India, presently covering most of the Maharashtra plateau, are a much larger flood basalt province.\nMid-Ocean Ridge Volcanoes\nThese volcanoes occur in the oceanic areas.\nThere is a system of mid-ocean ridges more than 70,000 km long that stretches through all the ocean basins.\nThe central portion of this ridge experiences frequent eruptions.\n\nVolcanoes can also be classified based on the frequency of eruption, mode of eruption and characteristic of lava.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nVolcanic Landforms:\nThe lava that is released during volcanic eruptions on cooling develops into igneous rocks.\nThe cooling may take place either on reaching the surface or from the inside itself.\nDepending on the location of the cooling of lava, igneous rocks are classified as:\nVolcanic Igneous rocks (Extrusive igneous rocks):\n\nCooling of the rock occurs at the surface of the earth.\u00a0 E.g. Basalt, Andesite etc.\n\nPlutonic Igneous rocks (Intrusive igneous rocks):\n\nCooling takes place in the crust and not over the surface. E.g. Granite, Gabbro, Diorite etc.\u00a0Intrusive igneous rocks are classed into the following types according to their forms.\n\nBatholiths: A large body of magmatic material that cools in the deeper depth in the form of a large dome. These are granitic bodies. They sometimes appear on the earth surface when the denudation processes remove the overlying materials.\nLaccoliths: Large dome shaped intrusive bodies with a level base and pipe-like conduit from below. Resembles a composite volcano structure, but beneath the earth. (Eg: Karnataka Plateau)\nLapoliths: They are saucer shaped, concave to the sky.\nPhacoliths:\u00a0Wavy materials which have a definite conduit to source beneath.\nSheets/ sills: They are the near horizontal bodies of intrusive igneous rocks. Thinner ones are called as sheets and while thick horizontal deposits are called sills.\nDykes: When the lava comes out through cracks and fissures, they solidify almost perpendicular to the ground to form wall like structures called dykes. (Eg: Deccan traps in Maharastra region).\n\nDistribution of Volcanoes:\n\nMost of the volcanoes in the world are found in three well defined belts:\n\nThe Circum-Pacific Belt (The Pacific Ring of Fire).\nThe Mid-World Mountain Belt.\nThe African Rift Valley Belt.\n\nVolcanic Activity \u2013 Points to note down:\nVolcanoes are closely related to the regions of intense folding and faulting.\nThey occur along coastal mountain ranges, on islands and in the mid oceans.\nInterior parts of the continent are generally free from their activity.\nMost of the active volcanoes are found in the pacific region which is thus called as the Pacific Ring of Fire.\n\nNext article in the series:\u00a0Earthquakes: Everything You Need To Know.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

These events are caused by the movement of the Earth\u2019s tectonic plates and are a common geological occurrence. Read here to learn more.\n\nEarthquakes and volcanoes are examples of sudden movements which originate from inside the earth. We have already seen the types of volcanoes. But, what is an earthquake?\n\nTo put it simply, an earthquake is the shaking of the earth. An earthquake can be defined as a sudden violent shaking of the ground as a result of movements in the earth\u2019s crust or volcanic action.\n\nThese movements result in the release of energy along a fault and cause the earth to shake. An earthquake, like a volcano, is a type of endogenic process.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEarthquakes: Points you should not miss!\nCauses of Earthquakes\nEarthquake waves or Seismic waves\nBody waves\nPrimary waves (p-waves)\nSecondary waves (s-waves)\nSurface Waves\nLove waves\nRayleigh waves\nShadow regions of waves\nMeasuring earthquakes\nMercalli Scale\nRichter Scale\nDistribution of Earthquakes\nEarthquakes: Points you should not miss!\nThe network of seismographic (seismograph is the instrument used to measure earthquakes) stations all over the world record dozens of earthquakes every day. Most of them are not felt by human beings as they are minor quakes only.\nThe occurrence of a severe earthquake is limited to a few regions in the world.\nThe point within the earth\u2019s crust where an earthquake originates is called the focus hypocenter or seismic focus.\nIt generally lies within a depth of 6 km in the earth\u2019s crust.\nThe point vertically above the focus on the earth\u2019s surface is called as the epicenter.\nThe intensity of the earthquake will be highest in the epicenter and decrease as one moves away.\nAll natural earthquakes take place in the lithosphere (i.e., the region that constitutes the earth\u2019s crust and rigid upper part of the mantle).\nCauses of Earthquakes\n\nEarthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth\u2019s surface. These plates are large sections of the Earth\u2019s crust that float on the semi-fluid layer of the mantle.\n\nThere are three main types of plate boundaries where earthquakes are common:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDivergent Boundaries: Plates move away from each other, creating tension and often resulting in earthquakes.\nConvergent Boundaries: Plates move toward each other, leading to compression and causing earthquakes.\nTransform Boundaries: Plates slide past each other horizontally, generating shear stress and causing earthquakes.\nEarthquake waves or Seismic waves\nThe earthquake which originates in the lithosphere propagates different seismic waves or earthquake waves.\nEarthquake waves are basically of two types \u2013 body waves and surface waves.\n\nBody waves\nThey are generated due to the release of energy at the focus and move in all directions traveling through the body of the earth. Hence, the name \u2013 body waves.\nThey travel only through the interior of the earth.\nBody waves are faster than surface waves and hence they are the first to be detected on a seismograph.\nThere are two types of body waves primary waves and secondary waves.\nPrimary waves (p-waves)\nPrimary waves are the fastest body waves (twice the speed of s-waves) and are the first to reach during an earthquake.\nThey are similar to sound waves, i.e., they are longitudinal waves, in which particle movement is in the same direction of wave propagation.\nThey travel through solid, liquid, and gaseous materials.\nThey create density differences in the earth material leading to stretching and squeezing.\n\nSecondary waves (s-waves)\nThey arrive at the surface with some time lag after primary waves.\nThey are slower than primary waves and can pass only through solid materials.\nThis property of s-waves led seismologists to conclude that the earth\u2019s outer core is in a liquid state. (the entire zone beyond 105o from the epicenter does not receive S-waves)\nThey are transverse waves in which directions of particle movement and wave propagation are perpendicular to each other.\n\nSurface Waves\nWhen the body waves interact with surface rocks, a new set of waves is generated called surface waves.\nThese waves move along the earth\u2019s surface.\nSurface waves are also transverse waves in which particle movement is perpendicular to the wave propagation.\nHence, they create crests and troughs in the material through which they pass.\nSurface waves are considered to be the most damaging waves.\nTwo common surface waves are Love waves and Rayleigh waves.\nLove waves\nThis kind of surface wave causes horizontal shifting of the earth during an earthquake.\nThey are much slower than body waves but are faster than Rayleigh.\nThey exist only in the presence of a semi-infinite medium overlain by an upper finite thickness.\nConfined to the surface of the crust, Love waves produce entirely horizontal motion.\n\nRayleigh waves\nThese waves follow an elliptical motion.\nA Rayleigh wave rolls along the ground just like a wave rolls across a lake or an ocean.\nBecause it rolls, it moves the ground up and down and side-to-side in the same direction that the wave is moving.\nMost of the shaking felt from an earthquake is due to the Rayleigh wave, which can be much larger than the other waves.\n\nShadow regions of waves\nWe already discussed that p-waves pass through all mediums while S-waves pass only through solid mediums.\nWith the help of these properties of primary waves, seismologists have a fair idea about the interior of the earth.\nEven though p-waves pass through all mediums, they cause reflection when they enter from one medium to another.\nThe variations in the direction of waves are inferred with the help of their record on seismographs.\nThe area where the seismograph records no waves is called as \u2018shadow zone\u2019 of that wave.\nAccordingly, it is observed that the area beyond 1050 does not receive S-waves, and the area between 1050 to 1400\u00a0 does not receive P-waves.\n\nMeasuring earthquakes\nSeismometers are the instruments that are used to measure the motion of the ground, which includes those seismic waves generated by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other seismic sources.\nA Seismograph is also another term used to mean seismometer though it is more applicable to older instruments.\nThe recorded graphical output from a seismometer/seismograph is called as a seismogram. (Note: Do not confuse seismograph with seismogram. A seismograph is an instrument while a seismogram is the recorded output)\nThere are two main scales used in the seismometers: (1) the Mercalli Scale and the Richter Scale.\nMercalli Scale\n\nThe scale represents the intensity of the earthquake by analyzing the after-effects like how many people felt it, how much destruction occurred etc. The range of intensity is from 1-12.\n\nAlso read: Avalanche: Types, Causes and Mitigation\n\nRichter Scale\n\nThe scale represents the magnitude of the earthquake. The magnitude is expressed in absolute numbers from 1-10. Each whole number increase in the Richter scale represents a tenfold increase in the power of an earthquake.\n\nDistribution of Earthquakes\n\nThere are two well-defined belts where earthquakes frequently occur \u2013\u00a0The Circum-Pacific Belt and\u00a0The Mid-World Mountain Belt.\n\nAbout 68% of earthquakes in the world occur in the Circum-Pacific Belt.\nThe mid-World Mountain belt extends from the Alps with extension into the Mediterranean, the Caucasus, and the Himalayan region and continues to Indonesia.\n21% of earthquakes are occurring in this belt.\nThe remaining 11% occur in the other parts of the world.\n\nNext in the series:\u00a0Exogenic Forces and their classification.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

E.g. the wind, water, waves etc.\n\nNote: A process is a force applied on earth materials affecting the same. An agent is a mobile medium (like running water, moving ice, winds, waves etc) which removes, transport and deposits earth materials.\n\nGeomorphic processes and geomorphic agents especially exogenic, unless stated separately, are one and the same.\n\nGravity and gradients are the two things that make these agents mobile.\n\nAll the movements either within the earth or on the surface of the earth occur due to gradients\u2013 from higher levels to lower levels, from high pressure to low pressure etc.\n\nThe exogenic forces derive their energy from the atmosphere determined by the ultimate energy from the sun and also the gradient created by tectonic factors. We have already discussed in previous articles that slopes on the earth surface are mainly created by tectonic factors or earth movements due to endogenic forces.\n\nWe know that force applied per unit area is called stress. Stress is produced in a solid by pushing or pulling.\n\nThe gravitational force acts upon all earth materials having a sloping surface and tends to produce movement of matter in the down-slope direction. This creates stress and induces deformation to the particles.\n\nWeathering\n\nWeathering is the action of elements of weather and climate over earth material.\n\nIt can be defined as mechanical disintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks through the actions of various elements of weather and climate.\n\nWhen rocks undergo weathering, some minerals are removed through chemical/ physical leaching by groundwater and thereby the concentration of remaining (valuable) minerals increase.\n\nWeathering can be classified as \u2013 physical, chemical and biological:\n\n(1) Physical / Mechanical weathering\nPhysical or mechanical weathering processes depend on some applied forces.\nThe applied forces could be (i) gravitational forces such as overburden pressure, load, and shearing stress; (ii) expansion force due to temperature changes, crystal growth or animal activity; (iii) water pressure controlled by wetting and drying cycles.\nCauses: Most of the physical weathering are caused by thermal expansion and pressure.\nA) UNLOADING AND EXPANSION:\nRemoval of overlying rock load because of continued erosion causes vertical pressure release.\nThus, the upper layers of the remaining rock expand to produce disintegration of rock masses.\nFractures will develop roughly parallel to the ground surface.\nIn areas of curved ground surfaces, arched fractures tend to produce massive sheets or exfoliated slabs.\nExfoliation is a result but not a process. Flaking off of more or less curved sheets of shells from over rocks or bedrocks results in smooth and rounded surfaces.\nSo, unloading and expansion create largely, smooth rounded domes called exfoliation domes.\nB) TEMPERATURE CHANGES AND EXPANSION:\nWith rising in temperature, every mineral expands and pushes against its neighbour and as the temperature falls, a corresponding contraction takes place.\nDue to differential heating and the resulting expansion and contraction of surface layers and their subsequent exfoliation from the surface results in smooth rounded surfaces in rocks.\nIn rock like granites, smooth-surfaced and rounded small to big boulders called tors form due to such exfoliation.\n\nC) FREEZING, THAWING AND FROST WEDGING:\nCycles of freezing and thawing (the weather becomes warmer and causes snow and ice to melt) cause frost weathering.\nIt is most effective at high elevations in mid-latitude where freezing and melting is often repeated.\nRapid freezing of water causes its sudden expansion and high pressure. The resulting expansion affects joints, cracks, and small intergranular fractures to become wider and wider till the rock breaks apart.\nD) SALT WEATHERING:\nSalts in rocks expand due to thermal action, hydration and crystallization.\nMany salts like calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium and barium have a tendency to expand.\nThe expansion depends on temperature and thermal properties. High temperature ranges between 30-50 0 C of surface temperatures in desert favours such salt expansions.\nSalt crystallization is the most effective of all salt weathering processes. It is favoured in areas of alternative wetting and drying conditions.\n(2) Chemical weathering\n\nChemical weathering can be due to solution, carbonation, hydration or oxidation/reduction.\n\nA) SOLUTION:\nWhen something is dissolved in water or acids, the water or acid with dissolved content is called a solution.\nThis process involves the removal of solids in solution and depends upon the solubility of a mineral in water or weak acids.\nWhen coming into contact with water, many solids disintegrate and mix up as a suspension in water.\nSoluble rock-forming minerals like nitrates, sulphates, potassium etc are affected by this process.\nThis kind of weathering mainly occurs in a rainy\nMinerals like calcium carbonate and magnesium bicarbonate present in limestone are soluble in water containing carbonic acid (formed with the addition of carbon dioxide in water) and are carried away in the water as a solution.\nCommon salt is also a rock-forming mineral and is susceptible to this process of solution.\nB) CARBONATION:\nCarbonation is the reaction of carbonate and bicarbonate with minerals and is a common process helping to break down feldspar and carbonate minerals.\nCarbon dioxide from the atmosphere and soil air is absorbed by water to form carbonic acid that acts as a weak acid.\nCalcium carbonates and magnesium carbonates are dissolved in carbonic acid and are removed in a solution without leaving any residue resulting in cave formation.\nC) HYDRATION:\nHydration is the chemical addition of water.\nMinerals take up water and expand; this expansion causes an increase in the volume of the material itself or rock.\nThe process is reversible and long, continued repetition of this process causes fatigue in the rocks and may lead to their disintegration.\ng. calcium sulphate takes in water and turns to gypsum, which is more unstable than calcium sulphate.\nD) OXIDATION AND REDUCTION:\nIn weathering, oxidation means a combination of a mineral with oxygen to form oxides or hydroxides.\nMinerals most commonly involved in this are iron, manganese, sulphur etc.\nThe red colour of the iron upon oxidation turns to brown and yellow.\nIn this process of oxidation, rock breakdown occurs due to the disturbance caused by the addition of oxygen.\nWhen oxidized minerals are placed in an environment where oxygen is absent, reduction takes place.\n(3) Biological weathering\nThis kind of weathering is caused by several biological activities like the growth or movements of organisms.\nThey also bring conditions for physical or chemical weathering.\nGrazing of animals, ploughing by human beings etc. are examples of biological weathering.\n\nAlso read: Earth\u2019s Crust: Elements, Minerals and Rocks\n\nMass Movements\n\nThese movements transfer the mass of rock debris down the slope under the direct influence of gravity.\n\nMass movements are very active over weathered slopes rather than over unweathered slopes.\n\nUsual geographic agents like running water, glaciers, wind, waves etc do not have much role to play in mass movements, and it is gravity, which is the main driving force.\n\nMass movements are classified into slow movements and rapid movements.\n\n(1) Slow movements:\nA) CREEP:\n\nIt occurs on moderately steep, soil-covered slopes (doesn\u2019t need to be lubricated with water as in solifluction). The movement is extremely slow and imperceptible except through extended observation. We might notice that some of the electric posts in our region which are posted in sloppy areas deviated from their horizontal linearity. This is an effect of creep.\n\nB) SOLIFLUCTION:\n\nIt is the process of slow downslope flowing of soil mass or fine-grained rock debris saturated or lubricated with water. It can be said as a type of creep with lubricated water influences the movement. It mainly occurs in permafrost regions as the layers of groundwater are occupied in between permanently frozen soil and rocks.\n\n(2) Rapid movements\n\nA) EARTHFLOW:\n\nThe movement of water-saturated clayey or silty earth materials down low angle terraces or hillsides is called earthflow.\n\nB) MUDFLOW:\n\nIn the absence of vegetation and cover and with heavy rainfall, thick layers of weathered materials get saturated with water and either slow or rapidly flow down along definite channels is called as a mudflow.\n\nC) DEBRIS AVALANCHE:\n\nIt is more in humid regions with or without vegetation. It occurs in narrow tracks on steep slopes and is similar to snow avalanche.\n\nD) LANDSLIDES:\n\nIn landslides, the materials involved are relatively dry irrespective of the above said rapid mass movements.\u00a0Landslides can be classified into a slump, debris slide, rockslide etc\n\nSlump: It is a type of landslide in which the slipping of several units of rock debris occurs with a backward rotation with respect to the slope over which the movement takes place.\nDebris slide:\u00a0In this type of landslide, there is no backward rotation. The fall is almost vertical.\nRockslide: It is nothing but the slide of individual rock masses.\nErosion and Deposition\n\nErosion is the acquisition and transportation of rock debris by geomorphic agents like running water, the wind, waves etc.\n\nThough weathering aids erosion, it is not a pre-condition for erosion to takes place. (i.e., erosion can take place in unweathered conditions also)\n\nThe deposition is a consequence of erosion. The erosional agents lose their velocity and energy on gentle slopes and materials carried by them start to settle themselves.\n\nNote: Deposition is not the work of any agents. It is just the end result\u00a0of erosion.\n\nNext in the series:\u00a0Erosion and Deposition: Action of Running Water and Groundwater\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

These processes are primarily driven by the movement of water, typically through rivers, streams, and other water bodies. Read here to learn about the erosional landforms by running water and groundwater.\n\nIn the previous articles, we were discussing various types of endogenic and exogenic processes. We have also seen that erosion and deposition are some of the exogenic processes. In this post, we are dealing with the geomorphic agents \u2013 running water and groundwater, which causes erosion and deposition. They form various erosional (destructional) and depositional (constructional) landforms.\n\nEven though we are considering the erosional and depositional activities and their landform creation, it should be kept in mind that they are always aided by weathering and mass movements. There are some other independent controls like (i) stability of sea level; (ii) tectonic stability of landmass; (iii) climate etc. which influence the evolution of these landforms.\n\nAlso read: Coastal Erosion\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat does Running Water do?\nCourses of \u00a0a river\nUpper Course / Stage of Youth (Erosion dominates):\nMiddle Course/ Stage of Maturity (Transportation dominates):\nLower Course/ Stage of Old (Deposition dominates):\nRunning water: erosion, transportation, and deposition\nErosion Types\nTransportation types\nErosional Landforms Due to Running Water\nValleys, Gorges, Canyon\nPotholes, Plunge pools\nIncised or Entrenched Meanders\nRiver Terraces\nDepositional Landforms Due to Running Water\nAlluvial Fans\nDeltas\nFlood Plains, Natural Levees\nMeanders and oxbow lakes\nBraided Channels\nWhat does Groundwater do?\nErosional Landforms due to Groundwater\nSinkholes\nCaves\nDepositional Landforms of Groundwater\nStalactites and stalagmites\nWhat does Running Water do?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

(Note: A valley can be formed in various ways like faulting, but here we are dealing only with the formation using an exogenic geomorphic agent).\nOnce a valley is formed, it later develops into a stream or river.\n\nCourses of \u00a0a river\n\nA river, which is the best example of the linear flow of running water through a valley, can be divided into three, based on its course \u2013 upper course, middle course, and lower course.\n\nUpper Course / Stage of Youth (Erosion dominates):\nIt starts from the source of the river in hilly or mountainous areas.\nThe river flows down the steep slope and, as a result, its velocity and eroding power are at their maximum.\nStreams are few, with poor integration.\nAs the river flows down with high velocity, vertical erosion or downward cutting will be high which results in the formation of V-shaped valleys.\nWaterfalls, rapids, and gorges exist where the local hard rock bodies are exposed.\nMiddle Course/ Stage of Maturity (Transportation dominates):\nIn this stage, vertical erosion slowly starts to replace with lateral erosion or erosion from both sides of the channel.\nThus, the river channel causes the gradual disappearance of its V-shaped valley (not completely).\nStreams are plenty at this stage with good integration.\nWider flood plains start to visible in this course and the volume of water increases with the confluence of many tributaries.\nThe work of the river predominantly becomes transportation of the eroded materials from the upper course (little deposition too).\nLandforms like alluvial fans, piedmont alluvial plains, meanders, etc. can be seen at this stage.\nLower Course/ Stage of Old (Deposition dominates):\nThe river starts to flow through a broad, level plain with heavy debris brought down from the upper and middle courses.\nVertical erosion has almost stopped and lateral erosion still goes on.\nThe work of the river is mainly deposition, building up its bed and forming an extensive flood plain.\nLandforms like braided channels, floodplains, levees, meanders, oxbow lakes, deltas, etc. can be seen at this stage.\n\nRunning water: erosion, transportation, and deposition\nErosion occurs when overland flow moves soil particles downlope.\nThe rock materials carried by erosion are the load of the river.\nThis load acts as a grinding tool helping in cutting the bottom and sides of the river bed, resulting in the deepening and widening of the river channel.\nErosion Types\n\nThe work of river erosion is accomplished in different ways, all of which may operate together. They are corrasion, corrosion, hydraulic action, etc.\n\nCorrasion or Abrasion: As the rock particles bounce, scrape, and drag along the bottom and sides of the river, they break off additional rock fragments. This form of erosion is called corrosion or abrasion. There are two types: vertical corrosion which acts downward and lateral corrosion which acts on both sides.\nCorrosion or Solution: This is the chemical or solvent action of water on soluble or partly soluble rocks with which the river water comes in contact.\nHydraulic Action: This is the mechanical loosening and sweeping away of material by the sheer force of river water itself. No load or material is involved in this process.\nTransportation types\n\nAfter erosion, the eroded materials get transported with the running water. This transportation of eroded materials is carried in four ways:\n\nTraction: The heavier and larger rock fragments like gravel, pebbles, etc. are forced by the flow of the river to roll along its bed. These fragments can be seen rolling, slipping, bumping, and being dragged. This process is called traction and the load transported in this way is called traction load.\nSaltation: Some of the fragments of the rocks move along the bed of a stream by jumping or bouncing continuously. This process is called saltation.\nSuspension: The holding up of small particles of sand, silt, and mud by the water as the stream flows is called suspension.\nSolution: Some parts of the rock fragments dissolved in the river water and transported. This type of transportation is called solution transportation.\n\nWhen the stream comes down from the hills to plain areas with the eroded and transported materials, the absence of slope/gradient causes the river to lose its energy to further carry those transported materials.\nAs a result, the load of the river starts to settle down which is termed as deposition.\nErosion, transportation, and deposition continue until the slopes are almost completely flattened leaving finally a lowland of faint relief called peneplains with some low resistant remnants called monadnocks.\nErosional Landforms Due to Running Water\nValleys, Gorges, Canyon\nAs we discussed above, valleys are formed as a result of running water.\nThe rills which are formed by the overland flow of water later develop into gullies.\nThese gullies gradually deepen and widen to form valleys.\nA gorge is a deep valley with very steep to straight sides.\nA canyon is characterized by steep step-like side slopes and may be as deep as a gorge.\nA gorge is almost equal in width at its top as well as bottom and is formed in hard rocks while a canyon is wider at its top than at its bottom and is formed in horizontal bedded sedimentary rocks.\nPotholes, Plunge pools\nPotholes are more or less circular depressions over the rocky beds of hills streams.\nOnce a small and shallow depression forms, pebbles and boulders get collected in those depressions and get rotated by flowing water. Consequently, the depressions grow in dimensions to form potholes.\nPlunge pools are nothing but large, deep potholes commonly found at the foot of a waterfall.\nThey are formed because of the sheer impact of water and the rotation of boulders.\n\nIncised or Entrenched Meanders\nThey are very deep wide meanders (loop-like channels) found cut in hard rocks.\nOver time, they deepen and widen to form gorges or canyons in hard rock.\nThe difference between a normal meander and an incised/entrenched meander is that the latter is found on hard rocks.\nRiver Terraces\nThey are surfaces marking old valley floors or flood plains.\nThey are the result of vertical erosion by the stream.\nWhen the terraces are of the same elevation on either side of the river, they are called as paired terraces.\nWhen the terraces are seen only on one side with none on the other or one at quite a different elevation on the other side, they are called unpaired terraces.\n\nDepositional Landforms Due to Running Water\nAlluvial Fans\nThey are found in the middle course of a river at the foot of a slope/mountain.\nWhen the stream moves from the higher level and breaks into a foot slope plain of low gradient, it loses the energy needed to transport much of its load.\nThus, they get dumped and spread as broad low to high cone-shaped deposits called alluvial fans.\nThe deposits are not roughly very well sorted.\nDeltas\nDeltas are like an alluvial fan but develop at a different location.\nThey are found in the mouth of the river, which is the final location of the depositional activity of a river.\nUnlike alluvial fans, the deposits making up deltas are very well sorted with clear stratification.\nThe coarser material settles out first and the finer materials like silt and clay are carried out into the sea.\nFlood Plains, Natural Levees\nDeposition develops a floodplain just as erosion makes valleys.\nA riverbed made of river deposits is the active flood plain and the flood plain above the bank of the river is the inactive flood plain.\nNatural levees are found along the banks of large rivers. They are low, linear, and parallel ridges of coarse deposits along the banks of a river.\nThe levee deposits are coarser than the deposits spread by flood water away from the river.\nMeanders and oxbow lakes\nMeanders are loop-like channel patterns that develop over the flood and delta plains.\nThey are not a landform but only a type of channel pattern formed as a result of deposition.\nThey are formed basically because of three reasons: (i) the propensity of water flowing over a very gentle gradient to work laterally on the banks; (ii) the unconsolidated nature of alluvial deposits making up the bank with many irregularities; (iii) the Coriolis force acting on fluid water deflecting it like deflecting the wind.\nThe concave bank of a meander is known as a cut-off bank and the convex bank is known as a slip-off\nAs meanders grow into deep loops, the same may get cut off due to erosion at the inflection point and are left as oxbow lakes.\nFor large rivers, the sediments deposited linearly at the depositional side of a meander are called Point Bars or Meander Bars.\nBraided Channels\nWhen selective deposition of coarser materials causes the formation of a central bar, it diverts the flow of the river towards the banks, which increases lateral erosion.\nSimilarly, when more and more such central bars are formed, braided channels are formed.\nRiverine Islands are the result of braided channels.\nWhat does Groundwater do?\nThe part of rain or snow-melt water that accumulates in the rocks after seeping through the surface is called underground water or simply groundwater.\nThe rocks through which water can pass easily are called permeable rocks while the rocks which do not allow water to pass are called impermeable rocks.\nAfter vertically going down to some depth, the water under the ground flows horizontally through the bedding planes, joints, or through the materials themselves.\nAlthough the amount of groundwater varies from place to place, its role in shaping the surface features of the earth is quite important.\nThe works of groundwater are mainly seen in rocks like limestone, gypsum, or dolomite which are rich in calcium carbonate.\nAny limestone, dolomite, or gypsum region showing typical landforms produced by the action of groundwater through the process of solution and deposition is called Karst Topography (Karst region in the Balkans)\nThe zones or horizons of permeable and porous rocks that are filled with water are called the Zones of Saturation.\nThe marks which show the upper surface of these saturated zones of the groundwater are called the Water Tables.\nAnd these rocks, which are filled with underground water, are called aquifers.\nThe water table is generally higher in areas of high precipitation and also in areas bordering rivers and lakes.\nThey also vary according to season. Based on variability, water tables are of two types: (i) Permanent water tables, in which the water will never fall below a certain level and wells dug up to this depth provide water in all seasons; (ii) Temporary water tables, which are seasonal.\nSprings: They are the surface outflow of groundwater through an opening in a rock under hydraulic pressure.\nWhen such springs emit hot water, they are called Hot Springs. They generally occur in areas of active or recent volcanism.\nWhen a spring emits hot water and steam in the form of fountains or jets at regular intervals, they are called geysers.\nIn a geyser, the period between two emissions is sometimes regular (Yellowstone National Park in the USA is the best example).\nErosional Landforms due to Groundwater\n\nSinkholes and caves are erosional landforms formed due to the action of groundwater.\n\nSinkholes\nSmall to medium-sized rounded to sub-rounded shallow depressions called swallow holes form on the surface of rocks like limestone by the action of the solution.\nA sinkhole is an opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped towards the bottom.\nWhen a sinkhole is formed solely through the process of solution, it is called a solution sink.\nSome sinkhole starts their formation through the solution process but later collapse due to the presence of some caves or hollow beneath it and becomes a bigger sinkhole. These types are called collapse sinks.\nThe term Doline is sometimes used to refer to collapse sinks.\nSolution sinks are more common than collapse sinks.\nWhen several sinkholes join together to form a valley of sinks, they are called as valley sinks or Uvalas.\nLapies are irregular grooves and ridges formed when most of the surfaces of limestone are eaten by the solution process.\nCaves\nIn the areas where there are alternative beds of rocks (non-soluble) with limestone or dolomite in between or in areas where limestone is dense, massive, and occurring as thick beds, cave formation is prominent.\nCaves normally have an opening through which cave streams are discharged\nCaves having an opening at both ends are called tunnels.\nDepositional Landforms of Groundwater\nStalactites and stalagmites\nThey are formed when the calcium carbonates dissolved in groundwater get deposited once the water evaporates.\nThese structures are commonly found in limestone caves.\nStalactites are calcium carbonate deposits hanging as icicles while Stalagmites are calcium carbonate deposits that rise from the floor.\nWhen a stalactite and stalagmite happen to join together, it gives rise to pillars or columns of different diameters.\n\nNext in the series: Evolution of landforms due to glaciers.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

Drumlins\nWhat is a Glacier?\nGlaciers are a mass of ice moving under its own weight.\u00a0They\u00a0are commonly found in the snow-fields.\nWe know that the landmass on the earth is not entirely the same as we see around. Some areas are covered by thick green forests, some with dry hot deserts, some with permanent ice covers etc. Among these varied landmasses, the permanently ice-covered regions on the earth surface are called as snow-fields. The lowest limit of permanent snow or snow-field is called as the snowline.\nA Glacier forms in areas where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries.\nThey form features like crevasses, seracs etc. A crevasse is a deep crack, or fracture, found in an ice sheet or glacier, as opposed to a crevice that forms in rock. A serac is a block or column of glacial ice, often formed by intersecting crevasses on a glacier.\nOgives are alternating wave crests and valleys (troughs) that appear as dark and light bands of ice on glacier surfaces. They are linked to seasonal motion of glaciers; the width of one dark and one light band generally equals the annual movement of the glacier.\nGlaciers cover about 10 percent of Earth\u2019s land surface and they are the largest freshwater reservoirs on earth.\n\nOn the basis of the location of the glacier, they can be classified as:\n\nContinental Glacier/Piedmont Glacier: they move outward in all directions\nValley/Mountain Glaciers: Move from higher elevation to lower\nErosional landforms due to Glaciers\n1. Cirque or Corris\nThey are deep, long and wide troughs or basins with very steep concave to vertically dropping high walls at its head as well as sides.\nThey are simply a bowl-shaped depression formed due to the erosional activity of glaciers.\nWhen these depressions are filled with water, they are called as Cirque lake or Corrie Lake or Tarn Lakes.\n\n2. Hanging Valleys or U-shaped Valleys, Fjords/fiords\nThe Glacier doesn\u2019t create a new valley like a river does but deepens and widens a pre-existing valley by smoothening away the irregularities.\nThese valleys, which are formed by the glacial erosions assume the shape of letter \u2018U\u2019 and hence are called as U-shaped Valleys or Hanging Valleys.\nA fjord is a very deep glacial trough filled with sea water and making up shorelines.\nA fjord is formed when a glacier cuts a U-shaped valley by ice segregation and abrasion of the surrounding bedrock and this valley gradually gets filled with the seawater (formed in mountains nearby sea).\n\n3. Horns and Aretes\nHorns are sharp pointed and steep-sided peaks.\nThey are formed by headward erosion of cirque wall.\nWhen the divide between two cirque walls gets narrow because of progressive erosions, it results in the formation of a saw-toothed ridge called Arete.\n\nDepositional Landforms due to Glaciers\n\nGlacial deposits are of two types:\n\n(i) Glacial Till \u2013 unassorted coarse and fine debris;\n(ii) Outwash \u2013 assorted roughly stratified deposits.\n1. Moraines\n\nMoraines are long ridges of deposits of glacial till.\nWhen these deposits are at the end of a glacier, they are called as Terminal moraines and when they are deposited on both sides, they are called as Lateral moraines.\nWhen lateral moraines of two glaciers join together, they form Medial moraines.\nWhen the lateral moraines of both sides of a glacier join together, it forms a horse-shoe shape.\nGround moraines are deposits left behind in areas once covered by glaciers.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n2. Eskers\nWhen glaciers melt in summer, the water which formed as a result of melting accumulates beneath the glacier and flows like streams in channels beneath that ice.\nVery coarse material like boulders, blocks and some minor fractions of rock debris are carried away by these streams.\nThey later get deposited in the valleys itself and once the ice melts completely, they are visible to the surface as sinuous ridges.\nThese ridges are called as Eskers.\n3. Drumlins\nThey are smooth oval-shaped ridge-like structures composed mainly of glacial till.\nIt shapes like an inverted spoon with the highest part is called as Stoss End and the lowest narrow part is called as Tail End.\nThey are formed as a result of glacial movement over some minor obstruction like small surface rocks.\nThe glacial till gets deposited in those obstructions and the movement of glacier shapes these deposits like an inverted spoon.\n\nNext in the series:\u00a0Evolution of landforms due to wind and waves.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

We have seen the evolution of landforms due to these agents. In this post, we discuss in detail how the wind and the waves cause the evolution of various landforms on the earth surface.\n\nAlso read: Coastal Erosion\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAction of\u00a0Winds:\nErosional Landforms due to Wind\n1.

Beaches and dunes\n2. Bars, spits, and Lagoons\nAction of\u00a0Winds:\nThe wind is the main geomorphic agent in the hot deserts.\nWinds\u00a0in hot deserts have greater speed which causes erosional and depositional activities in the desert.\nThe landforms which are created by erosional and depositional activities of wind are called as Aeolian Landforms.\nThis process is not unique to the Earth, and it has been observed and studied on other planets, including Mars.\nAn erg (also known as sand sea / dune sea / sand sheet if it lacks dunes) is a broad, flat area of desert covered with wind-swept sand with little or no vegetative cover. It is defined as a desert area that contains more than 125 square kilometres of aeolian or wind-blown sand and where sand covers more than 20% of the surface. Smaller areas are known as \u201cdune fields\u201d. The largest hot desert in the world, the Sahara, contains several ergs.\n\nAlso read: World Climate: Types and its Characteristics\n\nErosional Landforms due to Wind\n1. Pediplains\nWhen the high relief structures in deserts are reduced to low featureless plains by the activities of wind, they are called as Pediplains.\n2. Deflation Hollows\nDeflation is the removal of loose particles from the ground by the action of wind.\nWhen deflation causes a shallow depression by persistent movements of wind, they are called as deflation hollows.\n3. Mushroom Tables\nVentifacts are rocks that have been abraded, pitted, etched, grooved, or polished by wind-driven sand or ice crystals.\nThese geomorphic features are most typically found in arid environments where there is little vegetation to interfere with aeolian particle transport, where there are frequently strong winds, and where there is a steady but not overwhelming supply of sand.\nMushroom Tables / Mushroom rocks are Ventifacts in the shape of a mushroom.\nIn deserts, a greater amount of sand and rock particles are transported close to the ground by the winds which cause more bottom erosion in overlying rocks than the top.\nThis result in the formation of rock pillars shaped like a mushroom with narrow pillars with broad top surfaces.\n\nDepositional Landforms of Wind\n1. Sand dunes\nDry hot deserts are good places for sand dune formation.\nAccording to the shape of a sand dune, there are varieties of sand dune forms like Barchans, Seifs etc.\nThe crescent-shaped dunes are called as Barchans and they are the most common one.\nSeif is similar to Barchans but has only one wing or point.\n\n2. Loess\n\nIn several large areas of the world, the surface is covered by deposits of wind-transported silt that has settled out from dust storms over many thousands of years. These depositions are called as Loess.\nAction of Waves:\nCoastal processes are the most dynamic and hence most destructive.\nSome of the changes along the coast take place very fast. Storm waves and tsunami waves can cause far-reaching changes in short period of time than normal breaking waves.\nThe coastal landforms in the world can be classified into two categories:\n1. High Rocky Coast/ Submerged Coast/ Retreating Coast\n\nIn these type of coasts, the sea will be very close to the land without any coast or sometimes a narrow coast.\nThe shores of these high rocky coasts do not show any depositional landforms.\nErosional feature dominates here.\nWave-cut platforms, cliffs, sea caves etc are common here.\nMost of the west coasts of the Indian Peninsula belong to this category.\n2.

Cliffs, Terraces, Caves, Stacks and Stumps\nCliffs are common on the high rocky coasts.\nAt the foot of such cliffs, there may be flat or gently sloping platform covered by rock debris derived from the sea cliff behind.\nSuch platforms occurring at an elevation above the average height of waves is called as a wave-cut terrace.\nWhen the upper part of a coastal rock is hard and the lower part is soft, the erosion will not be uniform. The lower part erodes easily which results in the formation of a hollow part.\nThis hollow part, by frequent wave action, gradually develops into a sea-cave.\nSea arches are also formed in the same manner.\nSea stacks are nothing but the isolated standing rocks in the sea which were once a part of the cliff.\nThese stacks look will like small islands in the sea.\nSmall underwater stacks are known as stumps.\n\nDepositional Landforms due to Waves\n\u00a01. Beaches and dunes\nBeaches are characteristics of shorelines that are dominated by deposition.\nBeaches are temporary features which are made up of sand-sized materials.\nBeaches which contain excessively small pebbles and even cobbles are called as Shingle Beaches.\nSand dunes are formed just behind the beaches as long ridges parallel to the coastline.\n2. Bars, spits, and Lagoons\nBars are deposits of sand and gravel laid down by waves and currents which separate the shoreline from the sea.\nThey act as a barrier between the mainland and the sea.\nWhen one end of such bar is attached to the coast and other extends into the sea, it is called as a spit.\n\nTombolo is a deposition landform in which an island is attached to the mainland by a narrow piece of land such as a spit or bar.\nSometimes due to deposition of waves and currents, both ends of the bar join to enclose a part of sea water between the coast and the bar. This enclosed part of the sea forms a lake of saline water called as Lagoon.\n\nA lagoon is generally connected with the sea through a narrow passage.\nChilika and Pulicat lakes are examples of Lagoon Lake.\n\nNext in the series:\u00a0Major Landforms \u2013 Mountains, Plateaus, and Plains: Learn faster.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

Weathering acts upon the earth\u2019s crust constantly.\nTo a large extent, the process of wearing down depends on the shape and structure of the rocks upon which it acts.\nSo, in some cases, some portions of an elevated area escape from the process of weathering due to the hardness of the materials it is made of.\nThese portions remain unweathered while its surrounding area gets eroded constantly. This results in the formation of Residual or Relict Mountains.\nExamples: Hills like Nilgiri, Palkonda, Parasnath and Rajmahal and Mountains like the Aravalli, the Vindhya, and the Satpura are some of the examples of Relict Mountains in India.\nEconomic Significance of Mountains\nA storehouse of resources: Mountains are the storehouse of natural resources. Large resources of minerals like petroleum, coal, limestone are found in mountains. The mountains are the main source of timber, lac, medical herbs, etc.\nGeneration of hydro-electricity: Hydro-electricity is mainly generated from the waters of perennial rivers in the mountains.\nAn abundant source of water: Perennial rivers arising in the snow-fed or heavily rain-fed mountains are one of the important sources of water. They help in promoting the irrigation and provide water for many other purposes.\nFormation of fertile plains: The rivers that originate from the high mountain ranges bring silt along with water to the lower valleys. This helps in the formation of fertile plains and further the expansion of agriculture and related activities.\nNatural political frontiers:\u00a0The mountains can also act as natural boundaries between the two countries. They have a prominent role in protecting the country from external threats.\nEffects on climate:\u00a0They serve as a climatic divide between two adjoining regions. The mountains cause orogenic rainfalls, diversion, and blocking of cold winds, etc.\nTourist centres:\u00a0The pleasant climate and beautiful sceneries of the mountains have led to their development as centres of tourist attraction.\nPlateaus\nA plateau is an elevated area with a more or less levelled land on its top. It has a large area on its top and a steep slope on its sides.\nThey are also called as high plains or tablelands.\nThe plateaus cover about 18% of the earth\u2019s land surface.\nClassification of plateaus\n\nOn the basis of their geographical location and structure of rocks, the plateaus can be classified as:\n\nIntermontane Plateaus\nPiedmont plateaus\nContinental plateaus\nVolcanic plateaus\nDissected plateaus\nIntermontane Plateaus\n\nThe plateaus which are bordering the mountain ranges (generally fold mountains) or are partly or fully enclosed within them are the intermontane plateaus.\nThe word \u2018intermontane\u2019 means \u2018between mountains\u2019.\nIntermontane plateaus are the highest in the world.\nThey have nearly horizontal rock layers which are raised to very heights by vertical movements of the earth.\nExamples: The Plateau of Tibet is an example of the intermontane plateau which is surrounded by the fold mountains like the Himalayas, the Karakoram, the Kunlun and the Tien Shah.\nPiedmont Plateaus\n\nPlateaus which is situated at the foot of a mountain and is locked on the other side by a plain or a sea/ ocean is called as a piedmont plateau.\nThe word \u2018piedmont\u2019 means \u2018foot of a mountain\u2019.\nThey are also called as Plateaus of denudation as the areas once were high to the level of mountains, have now been reduced to the foot level of the mountain by various agents of erosion.\nExamples: The Malwa Plateau is an example of piedmont plateau.\nContinental Plateaus\n\nThey are formed either by an extensive continental upliftment or by the spread of horizontal basic lava (less viscous) sheets completely covering the original topography.\nThis kind of plateaus shows an abrupt elevation in contrast to the nearby lowland or sea (i.e. more steepness on sides).\nThe Continental Plateaus are also known as Plateaus of Accumulation.\nExamples: Plateau of Maharashtra is an example of the continental plateau.\nVolcanic Plateaus\nA volcanic plateau is a plateau produced by volcanic activity. There are two main types: lava plateaus and pyroclastic plateaus.\nLava plateaus are formed by highly fluid basaltic lava during numerous successive eruptions through numerous vents without violent explosions.\nPyroclastic volcanic plateaus are produced by massive pyroclastic flows and they are underlain by pyroclastic rocks.\n\nDissected Plateaus\nA dissected plateau is a plateau area that has been severely eroded so that the relief is sharp. Such an area may appear\u00a0as mountainous.\nDissected plateaus are distinguishable from orogenic mountain belts by the lack of folding, metamorphism, extensive faulting, or magmatic activity that accompanies orogeny (mountain building).\n\nThe economic significance of Plateaus\nA storehouse of minerals: Most of the minerals in the world are found in plateaus. The extraction of minerals in plateaus is relatively easier on plateaus than mountains. The major portions of industrial raw materials are obtained from plateaus. We get gold from the plateau of Western Australia; copper, diamond and gold from the plateaus of Africa; and coal, iron, manganese and mica from the Chottanagpur Plateau in India.\nGeneration of hydel-power: The edges of plateaus form waterfalls which provide ideal sites for generating hydel power.\nCool climate:\u00a0The higher parts of the plateaus even in tropical and sub-tropical regions have a cool climate.\nAnimal rearing and agriculture: plateaus have large grassland areas suitable for animal rearing especially sheep, goat, and cattle. The lava plateaus when\u00a0compared to other plateaus are richer in minerals and hence used for agriculture as\u00a0the soil is very fertile.\nPlains\nPlains are the most important landforms found on the earth surface.\nA plain is nothing but a low-lying relatively flat land surface with very gentle slope and minimum local relief.\nAbout 55% of the earth\u2019s land surface is occupied by plains.\nMost of the plain have been formed by deposition of sediments brought down by rivers.\nBesides rivers, some plains have also been formed by the action of the wind, moving ice and tectonic activities (Refer exogenic processes).\nClassification of plains\n\nOn the basis of their mode of formation, plains can be classified as:\n\nStructural plain\nErosional plains\nDepositional plains\nStructural Plains\n\nThese plains are mainly formed by the upliftment of a part of the sea floor or continental shelf.\nThey are located on the borders of almost all the major continents.\nThe structural plains may also be formed by the subsidence of areas.\nErosional Plains (Peneplains)\n\nErosional plains are formed by the continuous and longtime erosion of uplands.\nThe surface of such plains is hardly smooth and hence, they are also called as Peneplains, which means almost plain.\nDepositional Plains\n\nThese plains are formed by the depositional activity of various geomorphic agents.\nWhen plains are formed by the river deposits, they are called as riverine or alluvial plains.\nThe depositions of sediments in a lake give rise to a Lacustrine Plain or Lake Plains. The Valley of Kashmir is an example of lacustrine plain.\nWhen plains are formed by glacial deposits, they are called as Glacial or Drift Plains.\nWhen the wind is the major agent of deposition, those plains are called as Loess Plains.\nThe economic significance of Plains\nFertile soil: The plains generally have deep and fertile soil. As\u00a0they have a flat surface, the means of irrigation can be\u00a0easily developed. That is\u00a0why plains are called as the \u2018Food baskets of the world\u2019.\nThe growth of industries: The rich agricultural resources, especially of alluvial plains, have helped in the growth of agro-based industries. Since the plains are thickly populated, plenty of labour is available for the intense cultivation and for supplying the workforce for the industries.\nExpansion of means of transportation: The flat surface of plains favours the building of roads, airports and laying down railway lines.\nCentres of civilizations: Plains are centres of many civilizations.\nSetting up of cities and towns: Easy means of transportation on land and the growth of agriculture and industries in plains have resulted in the setting up and expansion of cities and towns. The most developed trade centres and ports of the world are found in the plains only and as much as 80% of the world\u2019s population lives here.\nSummary\n\nMountains, Plateaus and Plains are some of the important landforms on earth. Each of these is classified into different subtypes are economically significant.

Also, the origin of many phenomena like earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunami\u00a0etc are linked with the structure of earth\u2019s interior.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat should you understand about the interior of the earth?\nSources of Information about the interior of the earth\nDirect Sources:\nIndirect Sources\nStructure of the earth\u2019s interior\nCrust\nMantle\nCore\nTemperature, Pressure and Density of the Earth\u2019s Interior\nTemperature\nPressure\nDensity\nWhat should you understand about the interior of the earth?\nIt is not possible to know about the earth\u2019s interior by direct observations because of the huge size and the changing nature of its interior composition.\nIt is an almost impossible distance for the humans to reach till the centre of the earth (The earth\u2019s radius is 6,370 km).\nThrough mining and drilling operations we have been able to observe the earth\u2019s interior directly only up to a depth of few kilometers.\nThe rapid increase in temperature below the earth\u2019s surface is mainly responsible for setting a limit to direct observations inside the earth.\nBut still, through some direct and indirect sources, the scientists have a fair idea about how the earth\u2019s interior look like.\nSources of Information about the interior of the earth\nDirect Sources:\nRocks from mining area\nVolcanic eruptions\nIndirect Sources\nBy analyzing the rate of change of temperature and pressure from the surface towards the interior.\nMeteors, as they belong to the same type of materials earth is made of.\nGravitation, which is greater near poles and less at the equator.\nGravity anomaly, which is the change in gravity value according to the mass of material, gives us information about the materials in the earth\u2019s interior.\nMagnetic sources.\nSeismic Waves: the shadow zones of body waves (Primary and secondary waves) give us information about the state of materials in the interior.\nStructure of the earth\u2019s interior\n\nStructure of earth\u2019s interior is fundamentally divided into three layers \u2013 crust, mantle and core.\n\nCrust\nIt is the outermost solid part of the earth, normally about 8-40 kms thick.\nIt is brittle in nature.\nNearly 1% of the earth\u2019s volume and 0.5% of earth\u2019s mass are made of the crust.\nThe thickness of the crust under the oceanic and continental areas are different. Oceanic crust is thinner (about 5kms) as compared to the continental crust (about 30kms).\nMajor constituent elements of crust are Silica (Si) and Aluminium (Al) and thus, it is often termed as SIAL (Sometimes SIAL is used to refer Lithosphere, which is the region comprising the crust and uppermost solid mantle, also).\nThe mean density of the materials in the crust is 3g/cm3.\nThe discontinuity between the hydrosphere and crust is termed as the Conrad Discontinuity.\n\nMantle\nThe portion of the interior beyond the crust is called as the mantle.\nThe discontinuity between the crust and mantle is called as the Mohorovich Discontinuity or Moho discontinuity.\nThe mantle is about 2900kms in thickness.\nNearly 84% of the earth\u2019s volume and 67% of the earth\u2019s mass is occupied by the mantle.\nThe major constituent elements of the mantle are Silicon and Magnesium and hence it is also termed as SIMA.\nThe density of the layer is higher than the crust and varies from 3.3 \u2013 5.4g/cm3.\nThe uppermost solid part of the mantle and the entire crust constitute the Lithosphere.\nThe asthenosphere (in between 80-200km) is a highly viscous, mechanically weak and ductile,\u00a0 deforming region of the upper mantle which lies just below the lithosphere.\nThe asthenosphere is the main source of magma and it is the layer over which the lithospheric plates/ continental plates move (plate tectonics).\n\nThe discontinuity between the upper mantle and the lower mantle is known as Repetti Discontinuity.\nThe portion of the mantle which is just below the lithosphere and asthenosphere, but above the core is called as Mesosphere.\nCore\nIt is the innermost layer surrounding the earth\u2019s centre.\nThe core is separated from the mantle by Guttenberg\u2019s Discontinuity.\nIt is composed mainly of iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni) and hence it is also called as NIFE.\nThe core constitutes nearly 15% of earth\u2019s volume and 32.5% of earth\u2019s mass.\nThe core is the densest layer of the earth with its density ranges between 9.5-14.5g/cm3.\nThe Core consists of two sub-layers: the inner core and the outer core.\nThe inner core is in solid state and the outer core is in the liquid state (or semi-liquid).\nThe discontinuity between the upper core and the lower core is called as Lehmann Discontinuity.\nBarysphere is sometimes used to refer the core of the earth or sometimes the whole interior.\nTemperature, Pressure and Density of the Earth\u2019s Interior\nTemperature\nA rise in temperature with increase in depth is observed in mines and deep wells.\nThese evidence along with molten lava erupted from the earth\u2019s interior supports that the temperature increases towards the centre of the earth.\nThe different observations show that the rate of increase of temperature is not uniform from the surface towards the earth\u2019s centre. It is faster at some places and slower at other places.\nIn the beginning, this rate of increase of temperature is at an average rate of 10C for every 32m increase in depth.\nWhile in the upper 100kms, the increase in temperature is at the rate of 120C per km and in the next 300kms, it is 200C per km. But going further deep, this rate reduces to mere 100C per km.\nThus, it is assumed that the rate of increase of temperature beneath the surface is decreasing towards the centre (do not confuse rate of increase of temperature with increase of temperature. Temperature is always increasing from the earth\u2019s surface towards the centre).\nThe temperature at the centre is estimated to lie somewhere between 30000C and 50000C, may be that much higher due to the chemical reactions under high-pressure conditions.\nEven in such a high temperature also, the materials at the centre of the earth are in solid state because of the heavy pressure of the overlying materials.\nPressure\nJust like the temperature, the pressure is also increasing from the surface towards the centre of the earth.\nIt is due to the huge weight of the overlying materials like rocks.\nIt is estimated that in the deeper portions, the pressure is tremendously high which will be nearly 3 to 4 million times more than the pressure of the atmosphere at sea level.\nAt high temperature, the materials beneath will melt towards the centre part of the earth but due to heavy pressure, these molten materials acquire the properties of a solid and are probably in a plastic state.\nDensity\nDue to increase in pressure and presence of heavier materials like Nickel and Iron towards the centre, the density of earth\u2019s layers also gets on increasing towards the centre.\nThe average density of the layers gets on increasing from crust to core and it is nearly 14.5g/cm3 at the very centre.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarsan",

Intrusive Igneous Rocks\n2. Extrusive Igneous Rocks\nSedimentary Rocks\nMetamorphic Rocks\nRock Cycle\nSummary\nElements in the Earth\u2019s Crust\n\nThe earth is composed of various kinds of elements.\nAbout 98% of the total crust is made up of eight elements as oxygen, silicon, aluminium, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium.\nThe rest is constituted by elements like titanium, hydrogen, phosphorous, manganese, sulphur, carbon, nickel and others.\nThe elements in the earth\u2019s crust are rarely found exclusive but are usually combined with other elements to make various substances.\nThese substances are recognised as minerals.\nThe table below shows the percentage wise share of each element in both the earth\u2019s crust and the whole earth.\n\nMinerals in the Earth\u2019s Crust\nA mineral is a naturally occurring organic or inorganic substance, having an orderly atomic structure and a definite chemical composition and physical properties.\nA mineral is composed of two or more elements. But, sometimes single element minerals like sulphur, copper, silver, gold, graphite, etc are also found.\nThe basic source of all minerals is the hot magma in the interior of the earth.\nWhen magma cools, crystals of the minerals appear and a systematic series of minerals are formed in sequence to solidify so as to form rocks.\nThe minerals which contain metals are called metallic minerals (eg: Haematite) and the metallic minerals which are profitably mined are called as the ores.\nThe crust of the earth is made up of more than 2,000 minerals, but out of these, only six are the most abundant and contribute the maximum.\nThese six most abundant minerals are feldspar, quartz, pyroxenes, amphiboles, mica and olivine.\n\nAlso read: Exogenic Forces: Classification\n\nCharacteristics of some of the major minerals\nFeldspar:\nSilicon and oxygen are major elements of all types of feldspar.\nSodium, potassium, calcium, aluminium, etc are found in specific feldspar varieties.\nHalf of the earth\u2019s crust is composed of feldspar (plagioclase (39%) and alkali feldspar (12%)).\nIt has light cream to salmon pink colour.\nIt is commonly used in ceramics and glass making.\nQuartz:\nIt is one of the most important components of sand and granite.\nIt consists of silica and it is a hard mineral virtually insoluble in water.\nIt is usually white or colourless.\nThey are used in the manufacturing of radio, radar, etc.\nPyroxene:\nThe common elements in pyroxene are Calcium, aluminium, magnesium, iron and silicon.\nAbout 10% of the earth\u2019s crust is made up of pyroxene.\nIt is commonly found in meteorites.\nIts colour is usually green or black.\nAmphibole:\nAluminium, calcium, silicon, iron and magnesium are the major elements of amphiboles.\nThey form 7% of the earth\u2019s crust.\nIt is green or black in colour and is used in asbestos industries commonly.\nHornblende is another form of amphiboles.\nMica:\nIt is made up of elements like potassium, aluminium, magnesium, iron, silicon, etc.\nIt forms 4% of the earth\u2019s crust.\nIt is commonly found in igneous and metamorphic rocks.\nMica is widely used in electronic instruments.\nOlivine:\nMagnesium, iron and silica are the major elements of olivine.\nIt is commonly found in basaltic rocks with a greenish colour.\nOlivine is used commonly in jewellery.\n\nAlso read: Classification of Indian Rock System\n\nRocks in the earth\u2019s Crust\nA rock is nothing but a composition of minerals.\nThey are aggregates or a physical mixture of one or more minerals.\nRocks may be hard or soft and in varied colours.\nFeldspar and quartz are the most common minerals found in all type of rocks.\nThe science dealing with the study of rocks is called as Petrology.\nClassification of Rocks\n\nAs we said above, rocks differ in their properties, the size of particles and mode of formation.\nOn the basis of mode of formation, rocks may be classified into three:\nIgneous Rocks\nSedimentary Rocks\nMetamorphic Rocks\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIgneous Rocks\nIgneous rocks are formed by the cooling of highly heated molten fluid material called as Magma.\nAsthenosphere, which is just below the upper mantle, a region beneath Lithosphere is the main source of magma.\nThey might be formed directly by cooling of magma from the interior of the earth itself or by cooling of lava from the surface of the earth.\nAs they comprise the earth\u2019s first crust and all other rocks are derived from them, they are also called as the parents of all rocks or the Primary Rocks.\nThey are the most abundant rocks in the earth\u2019s crust.\nOn the basis of their mode of occurrence, igneous rocks can be classified as Intrusive and Extrusive Igneous Rocks.\n\n\u00a01. INTRUSIVE IGNEOUS ROCKS\nThey are formed when magma solidifies below the earth\u2019s surface.\nThe rate of cooling below the earth\u2019s surface is very slow which gives rise to the formation of large crystals in the rocks.\nThat is, the mineral grains of intrusive igneous rocks are very large.\nDeep-seated intrusive igneous rocks are called as Plutonic rocks and shallow depth intrusive igneous rocks are called as Hypabyssal Rocks.\nEg: Granite, dolerite, etc.\n\n2. EXTRUSIVE IGNEOUS ROCKS\nThey are formed by the cooling of the lava on the earth\u2019s surface.\nAs lava cools very rapidly on the surface, the mineral crystals forming extrusive igneous rocks are very fine.\nThese rocks are also called as Volcanic Rocks.\nEg: Gabbro, Basalt, etc.\n\nOn the basis of chemical properties, igneous rocks can be classified as Acid and Basic Igneous rocks.\nThey are formed as a result of solidification of acidic (high viscous) or basic lava (low viscous).\nAcidic igneous rocks are composed of 65% or more of silica. They are coloured, hard and very strong (Eg: Granite).\nBasic igneous rocks contain less than 55% of silica and have more iron and magnesium. They are dark in colour, weak enough for weathering (Eg: Basalt, Gabbro).\nSedimentary Rocks\n\n\u00a0\n\nThese rocks are formed by successive deposition of sediments.\nThese sediments may be the debris eroded from any previous existing rock which may be igneous, metamorphic or old sedimentary rocks.\nThe process of successive deposition and formation of sedimentary rocks is called as Lithification.\nDue to successive depositions, they have a layered or stratified structure and hence are also called as Stratified Rocks.\nDepending upon the mode of formation, sedimentary rocks can be classified as:\n\n1. Mechanically formed/ Clastic Sedimentary Rocks\n\nThey are formed by the consolidation of sediments under excessive pressure and cementation.\nEg: Conglomerate, Breccia, Sandstone, Shale, etc.\n\n2. Organically/ Biologically formed Sedimentary Rocks\n\nThe consolidation of organic matters derived from plants and animals form this type of rocks.\nEg: Coal, limestone, chalk, chert, etc.\n\n3. Chemically formed Sedimentary Rocks\n\nThey are formed by various chemical reactions.\nEg: Gypsum, rock salt, limestone, etc.\nMetamorphic Rocks\n\nThe word metamorphic means \u2018change of form\u2019.\nHence, these rocks form under the action of temperature, pressure and volume changes on original rocks.\nMetamorphic rocks are formed under the influence of heat or pressure on original rocks which cause to change their colour, hardness, structure and composition.\nThe process of recrystallization and reorganisation of materials within the original rock is called as metamorphism.\nWhen the metamorphism happens without any appreciable chemical change, it is called as Dynamic Metamorphism.\nIf metamorphism happened due to the influence of heat, it is called as Thermal Metamorphism. It has two types: Contact Metamorphism and Regional Metamorphism.\nWhen the reorganisation occurs due to direct contact with the hot magma, it is called as Contact Metamorphism.\nIf the rocks undergo reorganisation due to tremendous heat/ pressure formed as a result of tectonic shearing, it is called as Regional Metamorphism.\nMetamorphic Rocks can be classified into Foliated (Slate, Schist, Gneiss) and Non-Foliated (Quartzite, Marble) Metamorphic Rocks on the basis of the presence or absence of bands of mineral grains.\nRock Cycle\nRocks do not remain in their original form for a long time but may undergo transformations.\nThe rock cycle is a continuous process through which old rocks are transformed into new ones as shown in the diagram below.\n\nSummary\n\u201cCrust\u201d describes the outermost shell earth. Our planet\u2019s thin, 40-kilometer deep crust\u2014just 1% of Earth\u2019s mass\u2014contains all known life in the universe.\nOceanic crust is mostly composed of different types of basalts. Geologists often refer to the rocks of the oceanic crust as \u201csima.\u201d\u00a0Sima stands for silicate and magnesium, the most abundant minerals in oceanic crust.\nContinental crust is mostly composed of different types of granites. Geologists often refer to the rocks of the continental crust as \u201csial.\u201d Sial stands for silicate and aluminum, the most abundant minerals in the continental crust.\nSial can be much thicker than sima (as thick as 70 kilometers kilometers), but also slightly less dense (about 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter).\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Prithvi Vigyan\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarsan",

All the best for UPSC CSE Prelims 2017!\n\nOceanic land-forms (submarine relief)\nThere are mountains, basins, plateaus, ridges, canyons and trenches beneath the ocean water too.\nThese relief features found on the ocean floor are called Submarine Relief.\nThe ocean basins are broadly divided into four major subdivisions. They are;\nContinental Shelf\nContinental slope\nAbyssal plains\nThe ocean deeps/ submarine trenches\nContinental Shelf\nThere is no clear or well-defined line separating oceans from the continent. In fact, continents do not end abruptly at the shoreline.\nThey slope seaward from coast to a point where the slope becomes very steep.\nThis shallow submerged extension of the continent is called as the Continental Shelf.\n\nThe depth usually ranges from 120 to 370 meters from the surface water.\nTheir width also varies from a few kilometers to more than 100 kilometers.\nThis variation can be seen even in the context of the Indian peninsula. The continental shelf of the western\u00a0coast of India is much wider than that of the eastern coast. (Note: NIOS text mentions the opposite case)\nContinental shelves are much narrow or absent in some continents, particularly where Fold Mountains run parallel or close to the coast.\nThe shallow water over the shelf enables sunlight to penetrate through the water to the bottom and encourages the growth of microscopic plants and animals called planktons, which are the food for fishes.\nContinental Shelves are of greater importance to man. They are the sources of fishes, \u00a0minerals including sand and gravel, etc.\nA large quantity of world\u2019s petroleum and natural gas are obtained from the shelves.\nCoral reefs are also common on continental shelves.\nOne of the striking features of the continental shelf is the presence of submarine canyons which extend to the continental slope.\nThese canyons are \u2018steep-sided valleys\u2019 cut into the floor of the seas.\nThey are very similar to the gorges found on the continents.\nOne of the reasons for the formation of the submarine canyon is the underwater landslide.\nThe continental shelf is generally considered to be territorial water extents of the nations to which it adjoins.\nContinental Slope\nThe continuous sloping portion of the continental margin, seaward of the continental shelf and extending down to the deep sea floor of the abyssal plain, is known as Continental Slope.\nIt extends between the depths of 180m to 3600m.\nThey have very little deposits of sediments on them due to their steepness and increasing distance from the land.\nSea life is also far less here than on the shelf.\nThe base of the continental slope will have deposits of sediments. This belt of sedimentary deposits forms the Continental Rise.\nAbyssal Plain\nAbyssal plains are the extremely flat and featureless plains of the deep ocean floor.\nAbyssal plains are considered as the levelest areas on the earth.\nThey cover a major portion of the ocean floors between the depths of 3000m to 6000m.\nAbyssal plains are as irregular as the continental plains with submarine plateaus, hills, guyots, and seamounts.\nThe floor of the abyssal plain is covered by sediments.\nThe sediments which are formed from the remains of living things are called Oozes.\nOozes can be seen in those seas which favour an abundant growth of organisms.\nAnother type of sediments is red clay which is of volcanic origin or made up of tiny particles brought by wind and rivers.\nSome relief feature seen on abyssal plains are:\nSubmarine Ridges\nThe oceanic mountains are called as submarine ridges.\n\nThey are linear belts occurring near the middle of the oceans and are also called mid-oceanic ridges.\nThe oceanic ridge is the site of frequent earthquakes.\nVolcanism is common in ocean ridges and it produces many relief features.\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the largest continuous submerged mountain ridge which runs from north to south in the Atlantic Ocean.\nAt some places, the peaks rise above the sea surface to form Islands.\nSeamounts and Guyots\nSubmerged volcanoes with sharp tops are called as seamounts.\nSometimes they rise above the sea as isolated islands.\nHawaii and Tahiti Islands are such exposed tops of volcanoes.\nSeamounts with a flattened top are called as Guyots or Tablemounts.\nThe Ocean Deeps/ Submarine Trenches\nThe ocean deeps are the deepest part of the ocean.\nThey are generally called submarine trenches.\nThese trenches are not always located in the middle of the ocean basins. They may be very close or parallel to the continents bordered by Fold Mountains.\nThey are usually found adjacent to the areas of volcanic and earthquake activity.\nGreat earthquakes and tsunamis are born in them.\nThe Pacific Ocean has the largest number of trenches.\nThe Mariana trench in the Pacific Ocean is the deepest known part of the world.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarsan\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)",

(Any large system of rotating ocean current, particularly those involved with large wind movements is called a Gyre.).\nCurrent direction:\u00a0In general, currents in the northern hemisphere travel in the clockwise direction in a gyre, while currents in the southern hemisphere travel in the anti-clockwise direction \u00a0( the only exception is the current direction in the Indian ocean, which changes seasonally.)\nThe ocean current movement in the north-Atlantic gyre, as well as north-Pacific gyre, is clockwise, while the gyres in the Southern hemisphere are anti-clockwise.\nCurrent temperature:\u00a0In general, currents in the western part of every continent are\u00a0cold (the exceptions are mentioned in the article on\u00a0movements of the ocean water).\nCurrents coming from the polar region are generally cold.\nCurrents near to equator are generally warm.\nThere is a counter-equatorial current, which moves from west to east (warm).\nThe west-wind drift moves from west to east (cold)\n\nNow, that\u2019s the only quick note you need to learn the flow pattern of ocean currents. With the above points, you can find the nature of almost all currents. Let\u2019s analyse the major ocean currents.\n\nNorth Equatorial Current\nIt is a significant Pacific and Atlantic Ocean current that flows from east to west.\nThey flow in between 100 north and 200 north latitudes.\nDespite its name, the North Equatorial Current is not connected to the equator.\nIn both oceans, it is separated from the equatorial circulation by the equatorial countercurrent, which flows eastward.\nSouth Equatorial Current\nIt is a significant ocean current in the Pacific, Atlantic and the Indian Ocean that flows from east to west.\nThey flow in between the equator and about 200 south.\nIn the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, it extends across the equator to about 50 north.\nEquatorial Counter Current\nIt is an eastward flowing current found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.\nIt is found in between the North Equatorial and South Equatorial Currents at about 3-100 northern latitudes.\nThis counter-current replaces the water removed from the eastern side of the ocean by the North Equatorial and South Equatorial Currents.\nIn the Indian Ocean, the current tends to reverse hemispheres seasonally due to the impact of reversing Asian monsoons.\nAntarctic Circumpolar Current or West Wind Drift\nIt is an ocean current that flows from west to east around Antarctica.\nThe current is circumpolar due to the lack of any landmass connecting with Antarctica and thus keeps warm ocean waters away from Antarctica.\n\nThe Antarctic Convergence is associated with this current. It is the region where the cold Antarctic waters meet the water of the Sub-Antarctic, creating a zone of upwelling (a zone of very high marine productivity).\nGyres of Ocean Currents in each of the major Oceans\n\nThe major loops are seen in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean in both the hemispheres. Each of the currents follows more or less a definite pattern. But the currents in the Indian Ocean (Northern Hemisphere) change the flow direction between summer and winter.\n\nCurrents of the Atlantic Ocean\nTo the north and south of the equator, there are two westward-moving currents, i.e., the North and the South Equatorial Currents.\nBetween these two, there is the counter-equatorial current which moves from west to east.\nATLANTIC OCEAN: NORTHERN\u00a0HEMISPHERE\nThe South Equatorial Current bifurcates into two branches near the Cape De Sao Roque in Brazil and its northern branch joins the North Equatorial Current.\nA part of this combined current enters the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, while the remaining current passes along the eastern side of the West Indies as the Antilles Current.\nThe part of the current which enters the Gulf of Mexico comes out from the Florida Strait and joins the Antilles Current.\nThis combined current moves along the south-eastern coast of the U.S.A. and is known as the Florida Current up to Cape Hatteras.\nBeyond Cape Hatteras, it is known as the Gulf Stream.\nThe Gulf Stream starts when it exits the Florida Strait and follows North America northward to Newfoundland.\n\nA cold current from the Arctic Ocean called Labrador Current, which flows along the eastern coast of Canada, meets the warm Gulf Stream near the northeast corner of the U.S.A.\nThe confluence of these two currents, one cold and the other warm, produce fog around the region and makes it the most important fishing ground in the world.\nThe Gulf Stream then deflected eastward under the combined influence of the westerlies and the rotation of the earth.\nIt then crosses the Atlantic Ocean as the warm North Atlantic Drift.\nIn this journey, another cold current from the Arctic called the East Greenland Current joins with the North Atlantic Drift.\nThe North Atlantic Drift bifurcates into two branches on reaching the eastern part of the ocean.\nThe northern branch continues as North Atlantic Drift; reaches the British Isles from where it flows along the coast of Norway as the warm Norwegian Current and enters the Arctic Ocean.\nThe southern branch flows between Spain and Azores Island as the cold Canaries Current.\nThe Canaries Current finally joins the North Equatorial Current and completes the circuit.\nATLANTIC OCEAN: SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\n\nThe South Equatorial Current turns south and flows along the eastern coast of South America as Brazil Current.\nAt about 350 south latitude, due to the influence of westerlies and the rotation of the earth, the current moves eastward.\nA cold current called the Falkland Current which flows along the south-eastern coast of South America from south to north joins with the current at this time.\nThe Brazil Current moves eastward and crosses the Atlantic Ocean as South Atlantic Current.\nA part of the west wind drift or the Antarctic Circumpolar Current merges with the South Atlantic Current while crossing the Atlantic.\nNear the Cape of Good Hope, the South Atlantic Current is diverted northward as the Cold Benguela Current.\nBenguela Current finally joins with the South Equatorial Current and completes the circuit.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Bottom topography of Atlantic Ocean\n\nCurrents of the Pacific Ocean\nPACIFIC\u00a0OCEAN: NORTHERN\u00a0HEMISPHERE\nThe North Equatorial Current turns northward and flows along the Philippines Islands, Taiwan, and Japan to form the warm Kuro Shio or Kuro Siwo current.\n\nLater, a cold current called Oya Shio or Oya Siwo which flows along the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula merges with the Kuro Shio Current (Okhotsk Current is a cold current that merges with the Oya Shio before its confluence with Kuro Shio).\nFrom the southeast coast of Japan, the Kuro Shio current comes under the influence of westerlies and flow right across the ocean as the North Pacific Current.\nAfter reaching the west coast of North America, it bifurcates into two branches: the northern branch flows anti-clockwise along the coast of Alaska as warm Alaska Current and the southern branch moves southward along the coast of California as the cold California Current.\nCalifornia Current eventually joins with the North Equatorial Current and completes the circuit.\nPACIFIC\u00a0OCEAN: SOUTHERN\u00a0HEMISPHERE\n\nIn the South Pacific Ocean, the South Equatorial Current flows towards the west and turns southward as the East Australian Current.\nFrom Tasmania, it flows as the cold South Pacific Current from west to east and crosses the Pacific Ocean along with the West Wind Drift.\nOn reaching the south-western coast of South America, it turns northward and flows as the cold Peru Current or Humbolt Current.\nThe cold waters of the Peru Current are partially responsible for making the coast of northern Chile and western Peru with very scanty rainfall.\nPeru Current eventually joins with the South Equatorial Current and completes the circuit.\nCurrents of the Indian Ocean\nThe pattern of circulation of ocean currents in the Indian Ocean differs from the general pattern of circulation in the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans.\nThis is because the Indian Ocean is blocked by the continental masses in the north.\nThe general pattern of circulation in the southern hemisphere of the Indian Ocean is anti-clockwise as that of the other oceans.\nIn the northern hemisphere, there is a clear reversal of currents in the winter and summer seasons, which are completely under the influence of the seasonal changes of monsoon winds.\nINDIAN OCEAN: NORTHERN\u00a0HEMISPHERE DURING WINTER\n\nDuring winter, Sri Lanka divides the currents of the Arabian Sea from those of the Bay of Bengal.\nThe North-East Monsoon Drift flows westward just south of Sri Lanka with a countercurrent flow between it and the South Equatorial Current.\nDuring the winter season, in the northern section, the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea are under the influence of North East Monsoon Winds.\nThese North East Monsoon winds drive the waters of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea westward to circulate in an anti-clockwise direction.\nINDIAN OCEAN: NORTHERN\u00a0HEMISPHERE DURING\u00a0SUMMER\n\nIn summer, the northern part comes under the influence of the South West Monsoon.\nIt results in an easterly movement of water in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea in a clockwise direction.\nThis current is called the South West Monsoon Drift.\nIn the Indian Ocean, the summer currents are more regular than those of the winter.\nINDIAN OCEAN: SOUTHERN\u00a0HEMISPHERE\nIn the southern part, the South Equatorial Current which flows from east to west is strengthened by its corresponding current of the Pacific Ocean.\nIt then turns southward along the coast of Mozambique in Africa.\nA part of this current moving in between the African mainland and Mozambique is called the warm Mozambique Current.\nAfter the confluence of these two parts, the current is called Agulhas Current.\nAgulhas Current merges with the West Wind Drift when it crosses the Indian Ocean.\nA branch of this merged current flows along the western coast of Australia as the cold West Australian Current.\nIt later joins with the South Equatorial Current to complete the circuit.\n\nAlso read: Indian Ocean Geoid Low\n\nSummary\n\nAs mentioned above, the quick way to remember ocean currents is to remember the gyres.\n\nCurrents in the western part of every continent are cold.\n\nCurrents coming from the polar region are generally cold.\n\nCurrents near to equator are generally warm.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarsan",

It is the period between high tide and low tide during which water flows away from the shore.\nTypes of Tides\n\nA. Tides based on the frequency\n\nSemi-diurnal Tide: They are the most common tidal pattern, featuring two high tides and two low tides each day.\nDiurnal Tides: Only one high tide and one low tide each day.\nMixed Tide: Tides having variations in height are known as mixed tides. They generally occur along the west coast of North America.\n\nB. Tides based on the sun, the moon, and the earth\u2019s positions\n\nSpring Tides: When the sun, the moon, and the earth are in a straight line, the height of the tide will be higher than normal. These are called spring tides. They occur twice a month on the full moon (Poornima) and the other on the new moon (Amavasya).\nNeap Tides: Normally after seven days of a spring tide, the sun and the moon become at a right angle to each other concerning the earth. Thus, the gravitational forces of the sun and the moon tend to counteract one another. The tides during this period will be lower than the normal which are called the neap tides. They also occur twice in a month- during the first quarter moon and the last quarter moon.\nMagnitude of Tides\n\nPerigee: When the moon\u2019s orbit is closest to the Earth, it is called a perigee. During this period, unusually high and low tides occur.\n\nApogee: When the moon\u2019s orbit is farthest from the earth, it is called an apogee. Tidal ranges will be much less than the average during this period.\n\nPerihelion: It is the position where the earth is closest to the sun (around January 3rd). Unusual high and low tides occur during this time.\n\nAphelion: It is the position where the earth is farthest from the sun (around July 4th). Tidal ranges are much less than the average during this period.\n\nTIDAL BORE\n\nWhen the leading edge of the incoming tide forms a wave/ waves of water that travel up a river or a narrow bay against the direction of the river or bay\u2019s current, it is called a tidal bore. The Indian rivers like the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, etc. exhibit tidal bores.\n\nINTER-TIDAL ZONE\n\nThe intertidal zone, also known as the foreshore and seashore and sometimes referred to as the littoral zone, is the area that is above water at low tide and under water at high tide (i.e., the area between the tide marks).\n\nEFFECTS OF TIDES\nTides act as a link between the port and the open sea. Some of the major ports of the world, such as London port on the river Thames and Kolkata port on river Hugli are located on the rivers away from the sea coast.\nThe tidal current clears away the river sediments and slows down the growth of the delta.\nIt increases the depth of water which helps ships to move safely to the ports.\nIt also acts as a source for producing electricity.\n\nRead: Tidal Energy\n\nOcean Currents\n\nThe ocean currents are the horizontal flow of a mass of water in a fairly defined direction over great distances.\nThey are just like a river flowing in an ocean.\nOcean currents can be formed by the winds, density differences in ocean waters due to differences in temperature and salinity, gravity, and events such as earthquakes.\nThe direction of movement of an ocean current is mainly influenced by the rotation of the earth (due to the Coriolis force, most ocean currents in the northern hemisphere move in a clockwise manner, and ocean currents in the southern hemisphere move in an anti-clockwise manner).\nGyre, Drift, and Stream\nAny large system of rotating ocean currents, particularly those involved with large wind movements is called a Gyre. They are caused by the Coriolis force.\nWhen the ocean water moves forward under the influence of prevailing wind, it is called Drift (The term \u2018drift\u2019 is also used to refer to the speed of an ocean current which is measured in knots). E.g. North Atlantic Drift.\nWhen a large mass of ocean water moves in a definite path just like a large river on the continent, it is called a Stream. They will have greater speed than drifts. E.g. Gulf Stream.\nOcean eddies are swirling, rotating masses of water that can occur within ocean currents. They can have a significant impact on local oceanic and atmospheric conditions.\nTypes of Ocean Currents\n\nWarm Ocean Currents:\n\nThose currents that flow from equatorial regions towards poles which have a higher surface temperature and are called warm current.\nThey bring warm waters to the cold regions.\nThey are usually observed on the east coast of the continents in the lower and middle latitudes of both hemispheres.\nIn the northern hemisphere, they are also found on the west coast of the continents in the higher latitudes (E.g. Alaska and Norwegian Currents).\n\nCold Ocean Currents:\n\nThose currents that flow from polar regions towards the equator have a lower surface temperature and are called cold currents.\nThey bring cold waters into warm areas.\nThese currents are usually found on the west coast of the continents in low and middle latitudes of both hemispheres.\nIn the northern hemisphere, they are also found on the east coast in the higher latitudes (E.g. Labrador, East Greenland, and Oyashio currents).\n\nThe ocean currents can be also classified as:\n\nSurface Currents: They constitute about 10% of all the water in an ocean. These waters are occupied at the upper 400m of an ocean or the Ekman Layer. It is the layer of ocean water which moves due to the stress of blowing the wind and this motion is thus called Ekman Transport.\nDeep Water Currents: They constitute about 90% of the ocean water. They move around the ocean basin due to variations in the density and gravity.\n\nRead:\u00a0Marine cold waves\n\nFactors influencing the origin and nature of ocean currents\n\nDifference in density\n\nAs we all know, the density of seawater varies from place to place according to its temperature and proportion of salinity.\nThe density increases with an increase in salinity and decreases with a decrease in salinity.\nBut when the temperature increases, density decreases, and when the temperature decreases density increases.\nThis increase and decrease in density due to the differences in temperature and salinity causes the water to move from one place to another.\nSuch a movement of water due to the differences in density as a function of water temperature and salinity is called the Thermohaline Circulation.\nIn polar regions, due to a lower temperature, the waters will be of high density. This causes the waters to sink to the bottom and then to move towards the less dense middle and lower latitudes (or towards the equatorial regions).\nThey rise (upwelling) at the warm region and push the already existing less dense, warm water towards the poles.\nWhile considering the equatorial region, the high temperature in those regions causes the water to expand. Thus, the waters in these regions will be at a higher level than that of the middle and upper latitudes. This also creates a gradient and results in the movement of waters from the equatorial region to the middle and upper latitudes.\n\nThe earth\u2019s rotation\n\nEarth\u2019s rotation causes Coriolis force which deflects the air to its right in the northern hemisphere and its left in the southern hemisphere.\nSimilarly, ocean water is also affected by the Coriolis force and follows Ferrel\u2019s Law.\nHence, ocean currents in the northern hemisphere move in a clockwise (towards right) direction, and ocean currents in the southern hemisphere move in an anti-clockwise (towards left) direction (In the Indian Ocean due to the impact of the Asian monsoon, the currents in the northern hemisphere do not follow this pattern of movements all time).\n\nThe winds\n\nThe winds like trade winds and westerlies drive the ocean water in a steady flow in front of them.\nWhen the direction of the winds changes, the direction of the current also gets changed.\n\nThe movement of ocean water is a critical component of Earth\u2019s climate system and has far-reaching effects on weather patterns, marine ecosystems, and global climate regulation. Scientists continue to study and monitor these processes to better understand their impacts on our planet.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarsan",

(See\u00a0Major Ocean Currents: How to learn faster?) Having covered most of the important concepts in Lithosphere and Hydrosphere, in this article, we are going to discuss the composition and structure of the Earth\u2019s Atmosphere in detail.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is atmosphere?\nComposition of the atmosphere\nGases of the atmosphere\nCarbon dioxide:\nOzone gas:\nWater Vapour\nDust Particles\nStructure of the atmosphere\nTroposphere\nStratosphere\nMesosphere\nThermosphere\nExosphere\nWhat is atmosphere?\n\nWe all know that earth is a unique planet due to the presence of life. The air is one among the necessary conditions for the existence of life on this planet. The air is a mixture of several gases and it encompasses the earth from all sides. The air surrounding the earth is called the atmosphere.\n\nAtmosphere\u00a0is the air surrounding the earth.\nThe atmosphere is a mixture of different gases. It contains life-giving gases like Oxygen for humans and animals and carbon dioxide for plants.\nIt envelops the earth all round and is held in place by the gravity of the earth.\nIt helps in stopping the ultraviolet rays harmful to the life and maintains the suitable temperature necessary for life.\nGenerally, atmosphere extends up to about 1600 km from the earth\u2019s surface. However, 99 % of the total mass of the atmosphere is confined to the height of 32 km from the earth\u2019s surface.\nComposition of the atmosphere\nThe atmosphere is made up of different gases, water vapour and dust particles.\nThe composition of the atmosphere is not static and it changes according to the time and place.\nGases of the atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere is a mixture of different types of gases.\nNitrogen and oxygen are the two main gases in the atmosphere and 99 percentage of the atmosphere is made up of these two gases.\nOther gases like argon, carbon dioxide, neon, helium, hydrogen, etc. form the remaining part of the atmosphere.\nThe portion of the gases changes in the higher layers of the atmosphere in such a way that oxygen will be almost negligible quantity at the heights of 120 km.\nSimilarly, carbon dioxide (and water vapour) is found only up to 90 km from the surface of the earth.\nCARBON DIOXIDE:\nCarbon dioxide is meteorologically a very important gas.\nIt is transparent to the incoming solar radiation (insolation) but opaque to the outgoing terrestrial radiation.\nIt absorbs a part of terrestrial radiation and reflects back some part of it towards the earth\u2019s surface.\nCarbon dioxide is largely responsible for the greenhouse effect.\nWhen the volume of other gases remains constant in the atmosphere, the volume of the carbon dioxide has been rising in the past few decades mainly because of the burning of fossil fuels. This rising volume of carbon dioxide is the main reason for global warming.\nOZONE GAS:\nOzone is another important component of the atmosphere found mainly between 10 and 50 km above the earth\u2019s surface.\nIt acts as a filter and absorbs the ultra-violet rays radiating from the sun and prevents them from reaching the surface of the earth.\nThe amount of ozone gas in the atmosphere is very little and is limited to the ozone layer found in the stratosphere.\nWater Vapour\nGases form of water present in the atmosphere is called water vapour.\nIt is the source of all kinds of precipitation.\nThe amount of water vapour decreases with altitude. It also decreases from the equator (or from the low latitudes) towards the poles (or towards the high latitudes).\nIts maximum amount in the atmosphere could be up to 4% which is found in the warm and wet regions.\nWater vapour reaches in the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. Evaporation takes place in the oceans, seas, rivers, ponds and lakes while transpiration takes place from the plants, trees and living beings.\nWater vapour absorbs part of the incoming solar radiation (insolation) from the sun and preserves the earth\u2019s radiated heat. It thus acts like a blanket allowing the earth neither to become too cold nor too hot.\nWater vapour also contributes to the stability and instability in the air.\nDust Particles\nDust particles are generally found in the lower layers of the atmosphere.\nThese particles are found in the form of sand, smoke-soot, oceanic salt, ash, pollen, etc.\nHigher concentration of dust particles is found in subtropical and temperate regions due to dry winds in comparison to equatorial and polar regions.\nThese dust particles help in the condensation of water vapour. During the condensation, water vapour gets condensed in the form of droplets around these dust particles and thus clouds are formed.\nStructure of the atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere can be divided into five layers according to the diversity of temperature and density. They are:\n\nTroposphere\nStratosphere\nMesosphere\nThermosphere (Ionosphere)\nExosphere\n\nTroposphere\nIt is the lowermost layer of the atmosphere.\nThe height of this layer is about 18 km on the equator and 8 km on the poles.\nThe thickness of the troposphere is greatest at the equator because heat us transported to great heights by strong convectional currents.\nTroposphere contains dust particles and water vapour.\nThis is the most important layer of the atmosphere because all kinds of weather changes take place only in this layer.\nThe air never remains static in this layer. Therefore this layer is called \u2018changing sphere\u2019 or troposphere.\nThe environmental temperature decreases with increasing height of the atmosphere. It decreases at the rate of 1 degree Celsius for every 165 m of height. This is called Normal Lapse Rate.\nThe zone separating troposphere from the stratosphere is known as tropopause.\nThe air temperature at the tropopause is about \u2013 80 degree Celsius over the equator and about \u2013 45 degree Celsius over the poles. The temperature here is nearly constant, and hence, it is called tropopause.\nStratosphere\nStratosphere is found just above the troposphere.\nIt extends up to a height of 50 km.\nThe temperature remains almost the same in the lower part of this layer up to the height of 20 km. After this, the temperature increases slowly with the increase in the height. The temperature increases due to the presence of ozone gas in the upper part of this layer.\nWeather related incidents do not take place in this layer. The air blows horizontally here. Therefore this layer is considered ideal for flying of aircraft.\nThe upper limit of the stratosphere is known as stratopause.\nOne important feature of stratosphere is that it contains a layer of ozone gas.\nThe relative thickness of the ozone layer is measured in Dobson Units.\nIt is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere, from approximately 20 to 30 km above the earth\u2019s surface.\nIt contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere.\nIt is the region of the stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun\u2019s ultra-violet radiations.\nMesosphere\nIt is the third layer of the atmosphere spreading over the stratosphere.\nIt extends up to a height of 80 km.\nIn this layer, the temperature starts decreasing with increasing altitude and reaches up to \u2013 100 degree Celsius at the height of 80 km.\nMeteors or falling stars occur in this layer.\nThe upper limit of the mesosphere is known as mesopause.\nThermosphere\nThis layer is located between 80 and 400 km above the mesopause.\nIt contains electrically charged particles known as ions, and hence, it is known as the ionosphere.\nRadio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer and due to this, radio broadcasting has become possible.\nThe temperature here starts increasing with heights.\nExosphere\nThe exosphere is the uppermost layer of the atmosphere.\nGases are very sparse in this sphere due to the lack of gravitational force. Therefore, the density of air is very less here.\n\nWhat\u2019s next in the series: Insolation and Heat Balance of the Earth\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

    "[CONTENT] #48": "In the previous article, we discussed the composition and structure of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The atmosphere is essential for the survival of plant and animal life. They also require the optimum temperature to keep themselves warm and grow. In this article, we are going to discuss in detail some of the topics like insolation, terrestrial radiation, heat budget of the earth, albedo, etc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInsolation or Incoming Solar Radiation\nFactors influencing Insolation\n1.

Advection (horizontal transfer of heat)\nHeat Budget of the Earth\nAlbedo\nLatest developments\nVariation in the net budget at the earth\u2019s surface\nInsolation or Incoming Solar Radiation\n\nAs we all know, the sun is the primary source of energy for the Earth. The sun radiates its energy in all directions into space in short wavelengths, which is known as solar radiation.\nThe earth\u2019s surface receives only a part of this radiated energy (2 units out of 1,00,00,00,000 units of energy radiated by the sun).\nThe energy received by the earth\u2019s surface in the form of short waves is termed Incoming Solar Radiation or Insolation.\nThe amount of insolation received on the earth\u2019s surface is far less than that is radiated from the sun because of the small size of the earth and its distance from the sun.\nMoreover, water vapor, dust particles, ozone, and other gases present in the atmosphere absorb a small amount of solar radiation.\nThe solar radiation received at the top of the atmosphere varies slightly in a year due to the variations in the distance between the earth and the sun.\nDuring the earth\u2019s revolution around the sun, the earth is farthest from the sun on the 4th of July. This position of the earth is called aphelion. On 3rd January, the earth is nearest to the sun. This position is called perihelion.\nDue to this variation in the distance between the Earth and the sun, the annual insolation received by the earth on 3rd January is slightly more than the amount received on 4th July.\nHowever, the effect of this variation is masked by some other factors like the distribution of land and sea and the atmospheric circulation. Hence the variation does not have a greater effect on daily weather changes on the surface of the earth.\nFactors influencing Insolation\n\nThe amount of insolation received on the earth\u2019s surface is not uniform everywhere. It varies according to the place and time. When the tropical regions receive maximum annual insolation, it gradually decreases towards the poles. Insolation is more in summers and less in winters. The major factors which influence the amount of insolation received are:\n\nRotation of the earth on its axis\nThe angle of incidence of the sun\u2019s rays\nDuration of the day\nTransparency of the atmosphere\n1. Rotation of the earth on its axis\n\nThe earth rotates on its axis which makes an angle of 66.5 with the plane of its orbit around the sun.\nThe rotation of the earth on this inclined axis has a greater influence on the amount of insolation received at different latitudes.\n2. The angle of incidence of the sun\u2019s rays\n\nSince the earth is a geoid resembling a sphere, the sun\u2019s rays strike the surface at different angles at different places. This depends on the latitude of the place.\nThe higher the latitude, the less the angle they make with the surface of the earth.\nThe area covered by the vertical rays is always less than the slant rays. If more area is covered, the energy gets distributed and the net energy received per unit area decreases.\nMoreover, the sun\u2019s rays with small angles traverse more of the atmosphere than rays striking at a large angle.\nThe longer the path of the sun\u2019s rays, the greater the amount of reflection and absorption of heat by the atmosphere. As a result, the intensity of insolation is less.\n3. Duration of the day\nThe duration of the day varies from place to place and season to season. It decides the amount of insolation received on the earth\u2019s surface.\nThe longer the day, the greater the amount of insolation received. Conversely, a shorter day leads to the receipt of less insolation.\n4. Transparency of the atmosphere\n\nThe transparency of the atmosphere depends upon the cloud cover and its thickness, dust particles, water vapor, etc. They reflect, absorb, or transmit insolation.\nA thick cloud hinders solar radiation from reaching the earth\u2019s surface. Similarly, water vapour absorbs solar radiation resulting in less amount of insolation reaching the surface.\nWhen solar radiation passes through the atmosphere, water vapor, ozone, and other gases absorb much of the near-infrared radiation (mainly in the troposphere).\nVery small suspended particles in the troposphere scatter visible spectrum both to space and towards the earth\u2019s surface. This process adds color to the sky.\nThe red color of the rising and the setting sun and the blue color of the sky are the results of the scattering of the light within the atmosphere.\n\nNote: Maximum insolation is received over the subtropical desert, where the cloudiness is the least. The equator receives comparatively less insolation than the tropics. Generally, at the same latitude, the insolation is higher over the continent than over the oceans. In winter, the middle and higher latitudes receive less radiation than in summer.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHeating and Cooling of the Atmosphere\n\nThe sun is the ultimate source of atmospheric heat and energy. There are different ways of heating and cooling of the atmosphere. They are:\n\nTerrestrial Radiation\nConduction\nConvection\nAdvection\n1. Terrestrial Radiation\n\nBefore discussing terrestrial radiation, the following facts about radiation are worth noting.\n\nAll objects whether hot or cold emit radiant energy continuously.\nHotter objects emit more energy per unit area than colder objects.\nThe temperature of an object determines the wavelength of radiation. Temperature and wavelength are inversely proportional. The hotter the object, the shorter the length of the wave.\nSo, when the earth\u2019s surface is heated up by the insolation (in the form of short waves), it becomes a radiating body.\nThe earth\u2019s surface starts to radiate energy to the atmosphere in the form of long waves.\nThis is what we call terrestrial radiation. This energy heats the atmosphere from bottom to top.\nIt should be noted that the atmosphere is transparent to short waves and opaque to long waves.\nThe long-wave radiation is absorbed by the atmospheric gases, particularly by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Thus, the atmosphere is indirectly heated by the terrestrial radiation.\nThe atmosphere, in turn, radiates and transmits heat to space. Finally, the amount of heat received from the sun is returned to space, thereby maintaining a constant temperature at the earth\u2019s surface and in the atmosphere.\n2. Conduction (transfer of heat by contact)\nConduction is the process of heat transfer from a warmer object to a cooler object when they come in contact with each other.\nThe flow of heat energy continues till the temperature of both the objects becomes equal or the contact is broken.\nThe conduction in the atmosphere occurs at the zone of contact between the atmosphere and the earth\u2019s surface.\nConduction is important in heating the lower layers of the atmosphere.\n3. Convection (vertical transfer of heat)\n\nTransfer of heat by the movement of a mass or substance from one place to another, generally vertical, is called convection.\nThe air of the lower layers of the atmosphere gets heated either by the earth\u2019s radiation or by conduction. The heating of the air leads to its expansion. Its density decreases and it moves upwards.\nThe continuous ascent of heated air creates a vacuum in the lower layers of the atmosphere. As a consequence, cooler air comes down to fill the vacuum, leading to convection.\nThe cyclic movement associated with the convectional process in the atmosphere transfers heat from the lower layer to the upper layer and heats the atmosphere.\nThe convection transfer of energy is confined only to the troposphere.\n4. Advection (horizontal transfer of heat)\nThe transfer of heat through the horizontal movement of air (wind) is called advection.\nWinds carry the temperature of one place to another. The temperature of a place will rise if it lies in the path of winds coming from warmer regions. The temperature will fall if the place lies in the path of the winds blowing from cold regions.\nThe horizontal movement of the air is relatively more important than the vertical movement. In the middle latitudes, most of diurnal (day and night) variations in daily weather are caused by advection alone.\nIn tropical regions particularly in northern India during the summer season, local winds called \u2018Loo\u2019 are the outcome of the advection process.\nHeat Budget of the Earth\n\nThe earth as a whole does not accumulate or lose heat. It maintains its temperature.\nThis can happen only if the amount of heat received in the form of insolation equals the amount lost by the earth through terrestrial radiation.\nThis balance between the insolation and the terrestrial radiation is termed the heat budget or heat balance of the earth.\nThis is why the earth neither warms up nor cools down despite the huge transfer of heat that takes place.\nAlbedo\n\nAlbedo can be simply defined as a measure of how much light that hits a surface is reflected without being absorbed.\nIt is a reflection coefficient and has a value of less than one.\nWhen solar radiation passes through the atmosphere, some amount of it is reflected, scattered, and absorbed.\nThe reflected amount of radiation is called the albedo of the earth.\nThe value of albedo will be different for different surfaces.\nBecause of the effect of albedo, highly developed areas such as urban cities can experience higher average temperatures than the surrounding suburban or rural areas, a phenomenon known as the \u201cUrban Heat Island Effect\u201d.\nThe higher average temperature can be attributed to less vegetation, higher population densities, and more infrastructures with dark surfaces (asphalt roads, brick buildings, etc.).\nLatest developments\n\nNASA Launches Small Climate Satellite to Study Earth\u2019s Poles: The first of a pair of climate satellites designed to study heat emissions at Earth\u2019s poles for NASA is in orbit as it launched on May 25 2024.\n\nThe agency\u2019s PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission consists of two shoebox-size cube satellites or CubeSats, that will measure the amount of heat Earth radiates into space from two of the coldest, most remote regions on the planet. Data from the PREFIRE mission will help researchers better predict how Earth\u2019s ice, seas, and weather will change in a warming world.\n\nVariation in the net budget at the earth\u2019s surface\nAlthough the earth as a whole maintains a balance between the insolation and the terrestrial radiation, this is not what we observe at different latitudes.\nAs we have discussed earlier, there are variations in the amount of insolation received at different latitudes.\nIn the tropical region, the amount of insolation is higher than the amount of terrestrial radiation. Hence it is a region of surplus heat. In the polar region, the heat gain is less than the heat loss. Hence it is a region of deficit heat.\nThus the insolation creates an imbalance of heat at different latitudes.\nThis imbalance is nullified to some extent by winds and ocean currents, which transfer heat from surplus heat regions to deficit heat regions.\nThis process of redistribution and balancing of latitudinal heat is commonly known as Latitudinal Heat Balance.\n\nNote: Topics like Temperature, Factors controlling Temperature, and Distribution of Temperature will be covered in the next article.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Prithvi Vigyan; Ocean heat content\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan",

Cirrus\n\t\nThey are thin and often wispy. Typically found at heights greater than 20,000 feet (6,000 meters), they are composed of ice crystals that originate from the freezing of supercooled water droplets.\n\n\n2. Cirrostratus\n\t\nThey are high, very thin, comprise a uniform layer, and are composed of ice crystals. It isn\u2019t easy to detect and is capable of forming halos when the cloud takes the form of thin cirrostratus nebulosus.\n\n\n3. Cirrocumulus\n\t\nThey are small rounded puffs shaped, that usually appear in long rows high in the sky and are white, but sometimes appear grey.\n\n2) Middle Clouds\n\nThey form between 6,500 feet and cirrus level or from 2000 to 6000 meters.\nThey are also known as\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlto\u201d clouds.\nThey frequently indicate an approaching storm.\nThey may sometimes produce Virga, which is rain or snow that does not reach the ground.\nTypes\n\t\nDescription\n\n\n1. Altostratus\n\t\nThese are in the form of continuous sheets or veils, grey or blue-gray. They are composed of ice crystals and water droplets. In its thinner areas, the sun can still be visible as a round, dim disk. These clouds may often form ahead of storms with continuous rain or snow.\n\n\n2. Altocumulus\n\t\nThey are greyish sheet-like, characterized by globular masses or rolls in layers or patches, the individual elements being larger and darker than those of cirrocumulus and smaller than those of stratocumulus.\n\n3)\u00a0Low Clouds\n\nThey lie below 6,500 feet, which means from the surface to 2,000 meters.\nThey are also known as Stratus Clouds.\nThey may appear dense, dark, and rainy (or snowy) and can also be cottony white clumps interspersed with blue sky.\n\nTypes\n\t\nDescription\n\n\n1. Strato Cumulus\n\t\nUsually arranged in large dark, rounded, or globular masses, usually in groups, lines, or waves.\n\n\n2. Stratus\n\t\nIt usually looks like a huge grey blanket that hangs low in the sky resembles fog, comprises a uniform layer, and appears dull, if these clouds are warm it means rain and if it is cold it snows.\n\n\n3. Nimbostratus\n\t\nThey are known as \u2018Rain Clouds\u2019 and they are dark, thick, and accompanied by light to moderately falling precipitation.\n\n4) Great Vertical Extent Clouds\n\nThey are the most dramatic type.\nThey are also known as Storm Clouds.\nThey rise to dramatic heights, and sometimes well above the level of transcontinental jetliner flights.\n\nTypes\n\t\nDescription\n\n\n1. Cumulus\n\t\nThey are convection-type, puffy, and sometimes look like pieces of floating cotton. The base of each one is often flat and maybe only 1000 meters (3300 feet) above the ground. The top of the cloud has rounded towers.\n\n\n2. Cumulonimbus\n\t\nThey are dense towering and vertical and their top acquires an \u2018Anvil Shape\u2019, associated with thunderstorms and atmospheric instability, forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents.\nLearn all cloud types in a single diagram\n\nWhat is International Cloud Atlas?\n\nThe International Cloud Atlas describes the classification system for clouds and meteorological phenomena used by all World Meteorological Organization Members.\nIt includes a manual of standards and photographs of clouds and weather phenomena.\nIt was first published in the 19th century and was last updated 30 years ago.\nThe new 2017 version of \u00a0International Cloud Atlas was a digitalized one and has many additions.\nThe new cloud classifications\n\n1) The Species\n\nVolutus\n\nThey are long, typically low, horizontal, detached, tube-shaped cloud masses.\nThey often appear to roll slowly about a horizontal axis.\nThe species volutus is a soliton and hence not attached to other clouds.\nThis species applies mostly to Stratocumulus and rarely Altocumulus.\n\n2) The Supplementary Features\n\n(a)\u00a0Asperitas\n\nThere are well-defined, wave-like structures on the underside of the cloud.\nAsperitas is characterized by localized waves in the cloud base, either smooth or dappled with smaller features, sometimes descending into sharp points, as if viewing a roughened sea surface from below.\nThe varying levels of illumination and thickness of the cloud can lead to dramatic visual effects.\nThey occur\u00a0mostly with Stratocumulus and Altocumulus.\n\n(b) Fluctus\n\nThey are relatively short-lived wave formations, usually seen on the top surface of the cloud, in the form of curls or breaking waves (Kelvin-Helmholtz waves).\nThey occur mostly with Cirrus, Altocumulus, Stratocumulus, Stratus, and occasionally Cumulus.\n\n(c) Cavum\n\nThese are well-defined generally circular holes in a thin layer of supercooled water droplet cloud.\nThe Cavum is typically a circular feature when viewed from directly beneath, but may appear oval-shaped when viewed from a distance. When resulting directly from the interaction of an aircraft with the cloud, it is generally linear.\nThey occur in Altocumulus and Cirrocumulus and rarely Stratocumulus.\n\n(d) Murus\n\nIt is a localized, persistent, and often abrupt lowering of cloud from the base of a Cumulonimbus from which tuba (spouts) sometimes form.\nUsually associated with a supercell or severe multi-cell storm.\nMurus showing significant rotation and vertical motion may result in the formation of tuba (spouts), Commonly known as a \u2018wall cloud\u2019.\n\n(e) Cauda\n\nA horizontal, tail-shaped cloud (not a funnel) at low levels extends from the main precipitation region of a supercell Cumulonimbus to the murus (wall cloud).\nIt is typically attached to the wall cloud, and the bases of both are typically at the same height.\nCloud motion is away from the precipitation area and towards the murus, with rapid upward motion often observed near the junction of the tail and wall clouds and is commonly known as a \u2018tail cloud\u2019.\n\n3) Accessory Cloud\n\nFlumen\n\nThey are bands of low clouds associated with a supercell severe convective storm (Cumulonimbus), arranged parallel to the low-level winds and moving into or towards the supercell.\nThese accessory clouds form on an inflow band into a supercell storm along the pseudo-warm front.\nOne particular type of inflow band cloud is the \u2018Beaver\u2019s tail\u2019. This is distinguished by a relatively broad, flat appearance suggestive of a beaver\u2019s tail.\n\n4) Special Clouds\n\n(a)\u00a0Flammagenitus\n\nThese are observed to have originated as a consequence of localized natural heat sources (forest fires, wildfires, or volcanic activity) and consist of water drops.\n\n(b)\u00a0Homogenitus\n\nThese originated specifically as a consequence of human activity.\nThey include\u00a0aircraft condensation trails (contrails), or clouds resulting from industrial processes, such as cumuliform clouds generated by rising thermals above power station cooling towers.\n\n(c)\u00a0Homomutatus\n\nThese are formed as a result of persistent contrails (Cirrus homogenitus) that may be observed, over some time and under the influence of strong upper winds, to grow and spread out over a larger portion of the sky, and undergo internal transformation such that the cloud eventually takes on the appearance of a more natural cirriform cloud.\n\n(d)\u00a0Cataractagenitus\n\nThey may develop locally in the vicinity of large waterfalls due to water broken up into spray by the falls.\nCataractagenitus is formed when the downdraft caused by the falling water is compensated for by the locally ascending motion of air.\n\n(e) Silvagenitus\n\nThese may develop locally over the forests as a result of increased humidity due to evaporation and evapotranspiration from the tree canopy.\n\nWhat is Asperitas Cloud?\n\nAsperitas was formerly known as Undulatus asperitus.\nIt is a cloud formation proposed by Gavin Pretor-Pinney of the Cloud Appreciation Society (2009).\nIt was recently been accepted and added to the International Cloud Atlas on March 23, 2017, on the occasion of World Meteorological Day.\nThe \u2018Asperitas\u2019 is a Latin word and its meaning is \u2018Rough\u2018.\nThe Asperitas clouds tend to be low-lying and are caused by weather fronts that create undulating waves in the atmosphere.\nPyrocumulonimbus clouds\n\n2024: Wildfires raging in the United States and Canada are so intense that they have created pyrocumulonimbus clouds, which have the potential to spit out thunder and spark more fires.\n\nPyrocumulonimbus clouds (or pyroCb clouds) are a type of cumulonimbus cloud that forms specifically due to intense heat sources, such as wildfires, volcanic eruptions, or even nuclear explosions. These clouds are often associated with extreme weather phenomena and can have significant impacts on the environment.\n\nFormation: Pyrocumulonimbus clouds form when intense heat from a fire or eruption causes air to rise rapidly, creating an updraft. As the air ascends, it cools and condenses, forming a cloud. If the updraft is strong enough, it can create a cumulonimbus cloud, which is a thunderstorm cloud, but in this case, the \u201cpyro\u201d prefix indicates that it is fire-induced.\nStructure: These clouds can reach the stratosphere, much higher than typical thunderstorms, and are capable of producing lightning, hail, and even fire-induced tornadoes. They also generate strong downdrafts that can exacerbate the spread of fires on the ground.\nEnvironmental Impact: Pyrocumulonimbus clouds can inject large amounts of smoke, ash, and other aerosols into the upper atmosphere, affecting air quality and potentially influencing weather patterns. They are also known for their role in creating \u201cdirty\u201d thunderstorms, where lightning occurs in the absence of significant rainfall.\nGlobal Significance: Due to their ability to transport smoke and particles into the stratosphere, pyroCbs can have global implications, including contributing to climate change by affecting the Earth\u2019s radiation balance.\nExamples: These clouds have been observed during significant wildfire events, such as the Australian bushfires in 2019-2020, and the massive wildfires in Canada and the western United States. They have also been associated with volcanic eruptions like the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines.\nConclusion\n\nWhy do clouds appear white?\n\nThe clouds usually appear white because\u00a0the tiny water droplets and ice crystals inside them are tightly packed, and they reflect most of the sunlight that falls on these masses (scattering).\nThe tiny cloud particles equally scatter all colors of light, which makes the viewer perceive all wavelengths of sunlight mixed as white light.\n\nWhy do clouds darken at the time of rain?\n\nThe clouds appear dark or grey at the time of rain due to their particulate density.\nThe water vapor will bind together into raindrops, leaving larger spaces between these drops of water, and hence less amount of light is reflected, lending a darker appearance to the rain clouds.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Cloud seeding\n\nArticle by: Priyanka Sunil",

These preconditions are:\n\nPhysiographic homogeneity \u2013 surface should be either an oceanic surface or a plane on a continental surface.\nAtmospheric conditions must be stable for the origin of air masses. There should not be any major movement in the air. This is important for air to maintain contact with uniform surface area for a long duration of time.\nThe air should rest on the given surface for 2 to 3 days to absorb the properties of the given surface.\n\nSuch atmospheric conditions are found in very restricted areas on the globe where the air is sinking slowly and gradually over the uniform surface, such areas are:\n\nPolar and subpolar regions\u00a0 (due to the presence of polar high-pressure belts and related sinking of air)\nSubtropical high-pressure belts (due to subsidence of air from the upper troposphere to lower troposphere)\nSource regions:\n\nThe homogenous surfaces, over which air masses form, are called the source regions. The source region should be extensive with gentle, divergent air circulation. Areas with\u00a0high pressure but little pressure difference or pressure gradient are ideal source regions.\u00a0There are no major source regions in the mid-latitudes as these regions are dominated by cyclonic and other disturbances.\n\nThe main source regions are the high-pressure belts in the sub-tropics (giving rise to tropical air masses) and around the poles (giving rise to polar air masses).\nSource Region establishes heat and moisture equilibrium.\nWhen an air mass moves away from a source region, the upper level maintains the physical characteristics for a longer period. This is possible because they are stable with stagnant air which does not facilitate convection.\nMovement of air masses:\n\nOnce they are formed they start moving away from the source regions due to gravity.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUsually, they follow the path provided by the permanent winds system prevailing in that area which are polar winds, westerly winds, and trade winds.\n\nTypes of air masses\n\nClassification of air masses is done based on a variety of parameters. In total there are 16 kinds and each has been denoted by a symbol for identification. However, for understanding fronts and cyclones further, only two types of classification are required.\n\nThey are classified based on the nature of the surface from which they originate. On this basis they are classified as:\n\nContinental \u2013 originating from the homogeneous continental surface\nMaritime \u2013 originating from homogeneous oceanic surface\n\nTherefore the classification is done based on their latitudinal position. On this basis both the above-mentioned they have been further classified into two kinds of each:\n\nContinental Air mass\n\n1. Continental tropical air mass\n\nThe source regions include tropical and subtropical deserts of the Sahara in Africa, West Asia, and Australia.\nThese are dry, hot, and stable and do not extend beyond the source.\n\n2. Continental polar air mass\n\nSource regions of these are the Arctic basin, northern North America, Eurasia, and Antarctica.\nThese are characterized by dry, cold, and stable conditions.\nThe weather during winter is frigid, clear, and stable.\nDuring summer, the weather is less stable with the lesser prevalence of anticyclonic winds, warmer land, and lesser snow.\nMaritime air mass\n\n1. Maritime tropical air mass\n\nThe source regions of these include the oceans in the tropics and sub-tropics such as Mexican Gulf, the Pacific, and the Atlantic oceans.\nThese are warm, humid, and unstable.\nThe weather during winter has mild temperatures, overcast skies with fog.\nDuring summer, the weather is characterized by high temperatures, high humidity, cumulous clouds, and convectional rainfall.\n\n2. Maritime polar air mass\n\nThe source region of these is the oceans between 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 latitudes.\nThese are those continental polar air masses that have moved over the warmer oceans, got heated up, and have collected moisture.\nThe conditions over the source regions are\u00a0cool, moist, and unstable. These are the regions that cannot lie stagnant for long.\nThe weather during winters is characterized by high humidity, overcast skies, and occasional fog and precipitation.\nDuring summer, the weather is clear, fair, and stable.\n\nThey are also denoted by symbols as follows:\n\nMaritime tropical (mT)\nContinental tropical (cT)\nMaritime polar (mP)\nContinental polar (cP)\nContinental arctic (cA)\nAffect on global climate:\nThese have a deep impact on their areas of influence. For example, the Western European type of climate is fully developed by subtropical Marine Air masses.\nThe origin of temperate cyclones is dependent on the convergence of two contrasting air mass that are continental polar and Maritime tropical air mass.\nThe monsoon which is the backbone of Indian agriculture is also an example of tropical Marine Air mass",

The frontal zone is inclined at a low angle to the Earth\u2019s surface.\nThey are characterized by common characteristics such as large differences in air temperature across the convergence zone and bending isobars.\nIt is also a zone of intensification of low pressure, cooling of rising hot and humid air, condensation, cloud formation, and precipitation\nThe process associated with the creation of a new front is called frontogenesis. The process of destruction dying or dissolution of the front is called frontolysis.\nIn the northern hemisphere, frontogenesis happens in an anti-clockwise direction, and in the southern hemisphere in the clockwise direction due to the Coriolis effect.\nMid-latitude cyclones temperate cyclones or extra-tropical cyclones also occur due to frontogenesis.\nNecessary conditions for frontogenesis\nThe presence of two opposing air masses having contrasting properties of air temperature, air pressure, density, and humidity is important.\nTwo opposing air masses must have contrasting temperatures that are one air mass should be called dry and heavier while the other should be hot humid and light.\nIn such conditions, the cold and denser air mass being heavier invades the area of the warm and light Air mass.\nThe two masses must move in a face-to-face direction or converge.\nWhen air masses diverge they move in opposite directions and frontogenesis does not form.\nTypes of Fronts\n\nBased on the nature of convergence, relative acceleration of air masses, and stages of front formation, four types are identified-\n\nStationary\nWarm\nCold\nOccluded\nStationary front:\nIn this type, two air masses having contrasting physical properties rest against each other without showing any major movement.\nWeather generally remains stable but sometimes it might rain.\nAtmospheric conditions are stable within the front however atmospheric conditions can suddenly change across the stationary front also.\nCyclones migrating along stationary frontogenesis can dump heavy amounts of precipitation, resulting in significant flooding along the front.\nWarm front:\nWhen a warm air mass collides against a cold air mass, it rises above the cold air mass which is relatively heavier and denser.\nThe warm front is a gently sloping frontal surface along which warm and light air becomes active and aggressive and rises slowly over cold and dense air. Due to this condensation takes place gradually.\nIt leads to nimbostratus, altostratus and cirrostratus cloud formation. These clouds produce moderate to gentle precipitation over a relatively large area for several hours.\nCold front:\nThis is formed when cold air mass initiates the movement and hits the warm air and makes it rise.\u00a0 Here, condensation takes place rapidly.\nIt is a sloping frontal surface along which cold air becomes active and aggressive in the warm air territory.\nSevere storms can occur and during the summer months, thunderstorms are common in the warm sector.\nIn some regions like the USA, tornadoes occur in the warm sectors.\nCumulonimbus clouds are formed and heavy rainfall with lightning and thundering takes place.\nSometimes cold frontal precipitation is also associated with snowfall and hail storms.\nOccluded front:\nWhen warm air mass is completely raised over the cold air mass it is called an occluded front.\nWeather along this sector is complex\u2014a mixture of cold front type and warm front type weather. These are common in western Europe.\nThe formation of Mid-latitude cyclones (temperate cyclones or extra-tropical cyclones) involves the formation of an occluded front.\nClimatic Significance\n\n\nWhen a front passes over an area, it causes a change in the weather. The phenomenon causes weather events such as rain, thunderstorms, gusty winds, and tornadoes. On a cold front, there may be dramatic thunderstorms. At a warm front, there may be low stratus clouds. Usually, the skies clear once the front has passed.\n\nInstead of causing clouds and storms, some frontogenesis just causes a temperature change but some front formations can start Earth\u2019s largest storms. Tropical waves are a front that develops in the tropical Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa. These can also develop into tropical storms or hurricanes if conditions allow.\n\nThey move across the Earth\u2019s surface over multiple days and the direction of movement is often guided by high winds, such as Jet Streams.\u00a0 Landforms like mountains can also change the path of convergence.\n\nOn weather maps, the cold front is illustrated by blue lines with sharp \u201cteeth\u201d pointing in the direction of the wind.

The flow is from high pressure to low pressure and it is at right angles to isobars. The velocity of wind is directly proportional to pressure gradient force.\nCoriolis force/deflection force: The force that deflects the direction of the wind is called deflection force. They are deflected to the right (concerning their source) in the northern hemisphere and the left in the southern hemisphere.\nFriction force generated by surface: It is a restraining force on the flow of the wind.

During the day the land heats up faster and becomes warmer than the sea.\nOver the land, the air rises giving rise to a low-pressure area, whereas the sea is relatively cool and the pressure overseas is relatively high. Thus, a pressure gradient from sea to land is created and the wind blows from the sea to the land as the sea breeze.\nIn the night the reversal of condition takes place. The land loses heat faster and is cooler than the sea. The pressure gradient is from the land to the sea and hence land breeze results.\nVALLEY AND MOUNTAIN BREEZE\nIn the mountains, during the day the slopes get heated up and air moves upwards and the air from the valley blows up the valley to fill the resulting gap. This wind is known as the valley breeze.\nDuring the night the slopes get cooled and the dense air descends into the valley as the mountain wind. The cool air from mountains draining into the valley is called\u00a0katabatic wind.\nAnother warm wind occurs on the leeward side of the mountain ranges. The moisture in it, while crossing the mountain ranges condenses and precipitates. When it descends the leeward side of the slope the dry air gets warmed up by the adiabatic process. This dry air may melt the snow in a short time.\nTertiary or local wind\n\nThese are the types of wind blowing in a particular locality. Local differences in temperature and pressure produce local winds. Such type of wind is local in extent and is confined to the lowest levels of the troposphere.\n\nSome examples are discussed below:\n\nName\n\t\nType\n\t\nPlace\n\n\nChinook (Snow eaters)\n\t\nHot, dry\n\t\nThe Rocky mountains\n\n\nFoehn\n\t\nHot, dry\n\t\nThe Alps\n\n\nKhamsin\n\t\nHot, dry\n\t\nEgypt\n\n\nSirocco\n\t\nHot, moist\n\t\nSahara to the Mediterranean Sea\n\n\nSolano\n\t\nHot, moist\n\t\nSahara to the Iberian Peninsula\n\n\nHarmattan (Guinea doctor)\n\t\nHot, dry\n\t\nWest Africa\n\n\nLoo\n\t\nHot and dry\n\t\nNorth India and Pakistan\n\n\nNorwester\n\t\nHot\n\t\nNew Zealand\n\n\nSanta Ana\n\t\nHot\n\t\nSouth California\n\n\nKaraburun (black storm)\n\t\nHot dusty\n\t\nCentral Asia\n\n\nBora\n\t\nCold, dry\n\t\nBlows from Hungary to North Italy\n\n\nMistral\n\t\nCold\n\t\nThe Alps and France\n\n\nPampero\n\t\nCold\n\t\nArgentina\n\n\nPunas\n\t\nCold dry\n\t\nThe western side of Andes Mountain\n\n\nBlizzard\n\t\nCold\n\t\nTundra region\n\n\nPurga\n\t\nCold\n\t\nRussia\n\n\nLevanter\n\t\nCold\n\t\nSpain\n\n\nCalima\n\t\nDust-laden dry\n\t\nSaharan Air Layer across the Canary Islands\n\n\nElephanta\n\t\nMoist (in monsoon)\n\t\nMalabar coast\n\nThe Wind system causes the evolution of various landforms on the earth\u2019s surface as it is the main geomorphic agent shaping various landforms.

Sometimes temperate cyclones are so extensive that they cover an area of about 10 lakh square kilometers.\n\nTemperate cyclones extend up to 10 km from sea level in the upper troposphere.\n\nMoisture present in hot humid and lighter air mass is the source of energy in temperate cyclones. This moisture later becomes a source of cooling condensation cloud formation and rainfall. Since the source of energy in temperate cyclones is moisture present in warm air mass they can occur and develop over both oceanic and continental surfaces.\n\nTemperate cyclones are cyclones of mid-latitudes and hence are primarily under the influence of permanent winds of mid-latitude that is the westerlies.\n\nThe movement is these cyclones are eastwards of the origin with an average velocity of 32 km per hour in summers and 48 km per hour in winters.\n\nThe formation of temperate cyclones is a quick process but passes through a series of successive stages:\n\nThe period of a cyclone from its inception (cyclogenesis) to its termination (frontolysis or occlusion) is called the life cycle of a cyclone. It is completed through 6 successive stages and is described by the polar front theory.\n\nStage 1: It involves the convergence of two masses of contrasting physical properties and directions.\n\nStage 2: It is also called an incipient stage during which the warm and cold air masses penetrate the territories of each other and a wave-like front is formed under the influence of Coriolis force.\n\nStage 3: It is the mature stage when the cyclone is fully developed and isobars become almost circular. The energy and intensity of the cyclone are greatest in this stage. Rainfall is generated by nimbostratus clouds along the warm front and cumulonimbus clouds generate high-intensity rainfall at cold fronts.\n\nStage 4: The warm sector of the cyclone is narrow due to the more advancement of the cold front full stop as a warm front declines energy reservoir of the cyclonic system starts declining.\n\nStage 5: It starts with the occlusion of the cyclone when the advancing cold front finally overtakes the warm front and an occluded front is formed. The intensity of rainfall and winds declines further.\n\nStage 6: In this warm sector completely disappears occluded front is eliminated cold air mass covers the surface and ultimately cyclone dies out.\n\nTemperate cyclones are relatively regular and predictable compared to tropical cyclones and a primarily observed in the winter seasons.\n\nWESTERN DISTURBANCES:\n\nWave cyclones originating over the Mediterranean sea and Caspian sea flow eastward under the influence of subtropical westerly jet stream. The cyclones enter into North-Western parts of India during the winter season to generate snowfall on the Himalayan mountain ranges of Jammu and Kashmir Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. They also cause rainfall in the plains of Punjab Haryana Western Uttar Pradesh Delhi and northern Rajasthan and support Rabi crops.\n\n(2) Tropical cyclone\n\nTropical cyclones are formed between 5 degrees to 30 degrees in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are not formed over or near the equator due to a lack of Coriolis force.\n\nThey are low-pressure atmospheric systems of low latitudes.\n\nCyclones developed in the regions lying between the tropics of Capricorn and cancer are called tropical cyclones which are not regular and uniform like extratropical or temperate cyclones.\n\nNumerous forms of cyclones vary considerably in shape size velocity and weather conditions.\n\nDifferent names of tropical cyclones in different regions of the world:\n\nSoutheast Asia- typhoons\nCaribbean sea- hurricane\nIndian Ocean- tropical cyclones\nNortheast coast of Australia- Willy Willy\nA tornado is the smallest and most deadly form of cyclone in the Mississippi valley of the USA. They are funnel-shaped storms that are small but the most violent and disastrous of all storms. The center of a tornado is characterized by extremely low pressure.\n\nBecause of such steep pressure gradient winds rush hour with great force towards the center having a high velocity of 600 to 800 km per hour. The approach of tornadoes is heralded by dark and thick clouds in the sky resulting in complete darkness and minimum visibility and low air pressure.\n\nConditions required for the origin of tropical cyclones:\n\nPresence of a warm Ocean surface with a temperature of 27 degrees Celsius or more. The warm surface is the source of thermal convection and strong hot and humid currents. It is because of this factor that tropical cyclones are characteristically developed over the east coast of continents under the influence of warm ocean currents.\nThe presence of ITCZ (Inter Tropical Convergence Zone) supports the intensification of low pressure and augments the supply of moisture due to the inflow of trade winds.\nCoriolis force helps in deflection of strong influence wind to generate circulatory system. In the absence of Coriolis force tropical cyclones do not originate near the equator.\nPresence of high moisture in the atmosphere as it becomes the source of latent heat of vaporization which is the basic source of energy for a tropical cyclone.\nMinimum vertical wind shear to support the unrestricted flow of air currents upwards.\nDivergence of air in the upper troposphere.\n\nTropical cyclones cover relatively smaller areas but are more destructive. On average their diameters range between 80-300 km but sometimes they become so small that the diameter is restricted to 50 km or less. But they are relatively taller and extend up to 15 km from sea level in the upper troposphere.\n\nThe basic source of energy is the latent heat of vaporization present in hot and humid thermal convective currents. This latent heat of vaporization later becomes a source of cooling condensation cloud formation and rainfall.\n\nNormally they move from east to west under the influence of trade winds hence the general direction is there for the West word from their origin.\n\nA fully developed tropical cyclone consists of:\n\nEye: the pressure is lowest in the eye. It is a zone of high temperature and high humidity. It is also a cloudless, windless, and rain-less zone.\nInner eyewall: It is the most destructive part of a tropical cyclone. It is characterized by strong winds and the greatest intensity of rainfall. Rainfall is generated through cumulonimbus clouds.\nOuter eyewall: It is the outermost part of a tropical cyclone. In this zone, wind velocity is relatively low and so is the intensity of rainfall.\n\nTropical cyclones become very vigorous with high velocity over the oceans but become weak while moving over land areas and ultimately die out after reaching the interior portion of the continents. That is why the cyclones affect only the coastal areas of the continents.\n\nAlso read: India Meteorological Department (IMD)\n\nAnticyclones\n\nAnticyclones are centers of high pressure. They are surrounded by closed isobars having decreasing pressure outward.\n\nThe circulation is from central high pressure towards the periphery in such a way that air blows outwards in a clockwise direction in the Northern hemisphere and anticlockwise direction in the southern hemisphere.\n\nDue to Coriolis force, blowing winds are deflected from their paths to the right in the Northern hemisphere and left in the Southern hemisphere, \u00a0that\u2019s how it gets circular with a flowing system.\n\nThe difference in pressure between the center and periphery of anticyclone ranges between 10 to 20 mb and sometimes higher.\n\nThere are much larger in size and area than temperate cyclones as the diameter is 75% larger than that of temperate cyclones. Temperate anticyclones are very extensive that a single anticyclone can cover nearly half of the USA.\n\nThe track is highly variable and unpredictable. They move very sluggishly and sometimes they become stationary over a particular place for 4 days. The average velocity of an anticyclone is 30 to 50 km per hour.\n\nAnticyclones originated due to the descent of either polar cold air mass or warm tropical air mass.\n\nThese anticyclones are high-pressure systems and are more common in subtropical high-pressure belts and polar high-pressure belts where the air is sinking from the upper troposphere to the lower troposphere but are practically absent in equatorial regions.\n\nThe formation of anticyclonic conditions at polar high-pressure belts is a thermal phenomenon as these bills a thermally direct whereas the formation of anticyclonic conditions at subtropical high-pressure belts is a dynamic phenomenon as these bills are thermally indirect.\n\nHence, anticyclones of polar high-pressure belts are termed thermal anticyclones, and anticyclones of subtropical high-pressure belts are termed dynamic anticyclones.\n\nTypes of anticyclones:\nCold anticyclones or thermal anticyclones: They are formed above the Polar Regions due to the sinking of air. Post subsidence of air outflows from the polar region in an easterly and southeasterly direction.\nWarm anticyclones or dynamic anticyclones: They are formed above warm subtropical regions due to the sinking of air from the upper troposphere to the lower troposphere and consequent divergence of air.\nBlocking anticyclones: These developed due to obstruction in the air circulation in the upper troposphere that develops over mid-latitudes and are called blocking because they obstruct the flow of temperate cyclones in mid-latitudes.\n\nAnticyclones tend to produce fairly uniform weather. Whence descends from above at the center and the weather becomes clear and rainless because the descending wind brings atmospheric stability. The weather of Canada USA and northern Eurasia is mostly affected by anticyclones.\n\nColour code for Cyclones by IMD\n\nGreen: The color green denotes that everything is smooth and in order, or that \u201ceverything is well\u201d with no bad weather.\n\nYellow: The yellow color code requests that the security personnel \u201cbe updated\u201d to deal with adverse weather that could linger for days and could have an impact on everyday activities.\n\nOrange: The color-coded alert meaning \u201cbe prepared\u201d is orange. It may serve as a warning of severe damage to communication breakdowns that could result in power outages, traffic and rail jams, and other problems. The orange notice also serves as a warning to evacuate and to prepare the essentials for families.\n\nRed: The color red represents the strongest level of warning and urges authorities to \u201ctake action.\u201d In this situation, the worst weather conditions pose a hazard to human life.

Read to know more.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a jet stream?\nCharacteristics of Jet streams\nTypes of Jet streams\nSubtropical Westerly Jet stream\nPolar front Jet stream\nOther types\nClimatic Significance\nWhat is a jet stream?\n\nThe understanding of Jet streams is very important for understanding temperate cyclones and Indian monsoons.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), \u201ca strong narrow current concentrated along a quasi-horizontal axis in the upper troposphere or the stratosphere characterized by strong vertical and lateral wind shear and featuring one or more velocity maxima is called the jet stream.\u201d\n\nJet streams are strong, upper tropospheric flows that are quasi-horizontal. They originate due to differential heating of the earth\u2019s surface and form at the boundaries of adjacent air masses with significant temperature differences.\n\nThe factors that influence the flow of the jet stream are the landmasses and the Coriolis effect.\n\nLandmasses interrupt the flow of the jet through friction and temperature differences, whilst the spinning nature of the earth emphasizes these changes. This causes the meandering movement.\nThe meandering sections of the stream continue to change as they interact with landmasses creating a state of flux and subsequent temperature differences.\nIn winter, the temperature of the stratosphere can also affect the strength and position of the stream. The cooler the polar stratosphere, the stronger the jet stream.\nThe warmth of the landmasses and oceans (such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation) can also have an impact on the strength and amplitude of the stream.\nCharacteristics of Jet streams\nThe circulation of Jet streams is from west to east due to the effect of Earth\u2019s rotation. Generally, the circulation is observed between poles and 20 degrees latitude in both hemispheres.\nThese are also called circumpolar because they move around the poles in both hemispheres.\nTheir circulation path on the trajectory is wavy and meandering.\nThe extent narrows down during the summer season because of the northward shifting while these extend up to 20 degrees latitude during winters.\nThese may range from 40 km in width and 2-3 km in depth.\nThe average wind speed is very high with a lower limit of about 120 km per hour in winter and 50 km per hour in summer.\nThe maximum velocity of wind is recorded in the crest and trough of the jet stream.\nIn winter, it flows along the southern slopes of the Himalayas and shifts northwards in summer, flowing along the edge of the Himalayas (early June). And in late summers between July and August along the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.\nThe periodic movement of the Jet Stream often indicates the onset and subsequent withdrawal of the monsoon.\nThe northward movement of the subtropical stream is the first indication of the onset of the monsoon over India.\nTypes of Jet streams\n\nThe origin of the Jets is supported by three kinds of gradients:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe thermal gradient between the pole and equator\nThe pressure gradient between the pole and equator\nThe pressure gradient between surface and subsurface air over the poles.\n\nThe two major types are:\n\nThe subtropical jet stream\nThe mid-latitude or polar front jet stream\nSubtropical Westerly Jet stream\nThey move in the upper troposphere to the north of the subtropical high-pressure belt in both hemispheres that is above 30 degrees to 35 degrees latitude.\nTheir circulation from west to east and more regular than the polar front jet stream.\nIt flows through most of the year and is produced by the rotation of the earth.\nPolar front Jet stream\nThey are formed above the convergence zone (40 degrees and 60 degrees latitude) of the surface polar cold air mass and tropical warm air mass.\nThe thermal gradient is steep because of the convergence of two contrasting air masses.\nThese move in an easterly direction and have a more variable position than the subtropical jet.\nOther types\nThere is another type of upper-level jet called polar night jet which forms mainly during the winter months when the nights are much longer. It meanders through the upper stratosphere over the poles and is present in the convergence zone above the sub-polar low-pressure belt.\nA barrier jet in the low levels forms just upstream of mountain chains, with the mountains causing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains.\nCoastal low-level jets are related to a sharp contrast between high temperatures over land and lower temperatures over the sea and play an important role in coastal weather, giving rise to strong coast parallel winds. These are associated with oceanic high-pressure systems and thermal lows over land.\nA\u00a0valley exit jet is a strong, down-valley, elevated air current that flows above the intersection of the valley and its adjacent plain. They can achieve high speeds and heights.\nThe mid-level\u00a0African easterly jet occurs during the summer in the Northern Hemisphere between 10\u00b0N and 20\u00b0N above West Africa. While the nocturnal poleward low-level jet occurs in the Great Plains of East and South Africa.\nClimatic Significance\n\nThey have an immense influence on local and regional weather conditions.\n\nThere is a close relationship between the intensity of temperate cyclones and jet streams. Severe storms occur when Jet streams interfere with surface wind systems.\n\nThey also help in giving a relatively clear picture of the occurrence of the events of El Nino and La Nina\n\nThey are also used by aviators if they have to fly in the direction of the flow of the jet streams. But aviators avoid them when flying in the opposite direction of the jet streams because Jet streams are unpredictable and can cause sudden movement even when the weather looks calm and clear.\n\nThe monsoon of South Asia is largely affected and controlled by Jet streams.\n\nThe monsoons also depend on the upper air circulation which Sub Tropical Jet Streams dominate. The southwest monsoon in India is related to the tropical easterly stream which is between 8-35 degrees North latitudes. The northeast monsoon in the winters is related to the subtropical westerly Jet Stream which blows between 20-35 degree latitudes in both hemispheres.\n\nThey are also known to bring ozone-depleting substances to the stratosphere, aiding the ozone layer depletion by acting as a vehicle.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Atmospheric River; Heat Index",

Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor so that the water condenses and precipitates.\n\nThere are five forms of precipitation:\n\nRainfall: It is the fall of atmospheric moisture in the form of water due to gravity.\nSnow: Precipitation of white opaque crystals when cloud forms below zero degree Celcius.\nHail: It falls in the form of small ice pellets and is a very destructive form of precipitation produced by thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.\nSleet: It is a mix of rain and snow or it is frozen rain that forms when rain passes through very cold air mass before reaching the land.\nDrizzle: Very small and uniform sized raindrops (less than 0.5 mm size)\nRainfall\n\nIt is the most common form of precipitation, especially in low latitudes. Monsoon or equatorial rains are good examples to understand.\n\nConditions for rain formation:\n\nWarm, moist, and unstable air\nSufficient number of hygroscopic nuclei\n\nThe warm and moist air after being lifted upward becomes saturated and clouds are formed but the process of condensation begins only when the relative humidity of ascending air exceeds a hundred percent.\nRainfall does not occur unless these cloud droplets become so large due to coalescence that the air becomes unable to hold them.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTypes of rainfall\n\nGenerally, three different types of rainfall are recognized:\n\nConvectional or convective rainfall occurs due to thermal convection currents caused by insolation heating of the ground surface.\nOrographic rainfall occurs due to the accent of air from highland.\nCyclonic or frontal rainfall occurs due to upward movement of air caused by convergence of contrasting wind\nConvectional Rain:\n\nConvectional rain occurs mainly in equatorial regions where daily heating of the ground surface causes convection currents. The sky becomes overcast by afternoon daily causing pitch darkness and heavy rains to follow. Thus the convectional rainfall in the equatorial region is a daily regular feature.\n\nIn this type of rainfall, there is a thermal convective rise of hot and humid air. For the hot and humid air to rise two conditions are necessary:\n\nPresence of moisture through evaporation to the air so that relative humidity becomes high.\nIntense heating of ground surface through incoming short wave solar radiation insolation heating.\n\nThe ground surface is intensely heated due to the enormous amount of heat received. The air in contact with a warm surface also gets heated expands and ultimately rises upward. The ascending warm and moist air cools becomes saturated, causes condensation and cloud formation, and rainfall starts.\n\nIndia receives convectional rainfall during the summer season before the onset of Southwest monsoon these are known by local names in India like mango showers, Kal Baisakhi, bhardoli cheera, etc.\n\nOrographic rain:\n\nThe rain which is caused by the physiographic barrier for falling in the path of moisture-laden air is known as orographic rainfall. The moisture in the air is forced to rise which gets cooled adiabatically leading to condensation, cloud formation, and rain. This occurs on the windward side of the hill or by any other physiographic barrier like plateau or mountain.\n\nNecessary conditions for the occurrence of orographic rainfall are:\n\nThey should be mountain barriers across the wind direction so that the moist air is forced on obstruction to move upwards\nThere should be enough moisture content in the air and the presence of an onshore wind that is hot and humid\n\nFeatures of orographic rainfall:\n\nMore rainfall on the windward side and less on the leeward side\nMaximum rainfall near the mountain slopes decreases away from the foothills\nWindward slopes of mountains are at the time of rainfall are characterized by cumulus clouds and leeward side slopes have stratus clouds.\n\nAmount of rainfall depends on:\n\nAmount of moisture present in onshore winds\nDistance of mountain barrier from the coast\nAltitude and slope of the mountain\n\nOrographic rainfall is the most common in the world and India. Rainfall in India through Southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon is orographic.\n\nAlso read: Unseasonal Rains in India\n\nCyclonic or frontal rain:\n\nThis occurs due to the convergence of extensive air masses. When two contrasting air masses like cold polar air mass and warm westerly air mass coming from opposite directions converge along a line a front is formed. The warm wind is lifted upward along this front where the cold air being heavier settles down.\n\nSuch cyclonic fronts are created in temperate regions where cold polar winds and warm westerlies converge. The warm air lying over cold air is cooled and gets saturated and condensation begins around hygroscopic nuclei.\n\nThe lifting of warm air along the cyclonic front is not vertical like convective currents rather it is along an inclined plane.\n\nThe front is a zone of intensification of low pressure, cooling condensation, cloud formation, and rainfall- the entire process is known as frontogenesis.\n\nFrontal rainfall is most common in mid-latitudes as it is a zone of convergence of warm westerlies and cold polar easterlies. Frontogenesis is also the basis of the formation of temperate cyclones. Temperate cyclones also produce frontal rainfall in India during the winter season in North-Western parts of India which are known as western disturbances.",

Thus the classification was:\n\nUrvara [fertile]\nUsara [sterile]\n\nIn the modern period, when men started to know about the various characteristics of soil they began to classify soil based on texture, color, moisture, etc.\n\nWhen the Soil Survey of India was established in 1956,\u00a0they studied the soils of India and their characteristics.\nThe National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning, an institute under the control of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research did a lot of studies on Indian soil.\nClassification of Soils of India\n\nAlluvial soil [43%]\nRed soil [18.5%]\nBlack/regur soil [15%]\nArid / desert soil\nLaterite soil\nSaline soil\nPeaty / marshy soil\nForest soil\nSub-mountain soil\nSnowfields\nAlluvial soil:\nMostly available soil in India (about 43%) covers an area of 143 sq. km.\nWidespread in northern plains and river valleys.\nIn peninsular India, they are primarily found in deltas and estuaries.\nHumus, lime, and organic matter are present.\nHighly fertile.\nIndus-Ganga-Brahmaputhra plain, Narmada-Tapi plain etc are examples.\nThey are depositional soil \u2013 transported and deposited by rivers, streams, etc.\nSand content decreases from west to east of the country.\nNew alluvium is termed as Khadar and old alluvium is termed as Bhangar.\nColor: Light Grey to Ash Grey.\nTexture: Sandy to silty loam or clay.\nRich in: potash\nPoor in: phosphorous.\nWheat, rice, maize, sugarcane, pulses, oilseed, etc. are cultivated mainly.\nRed soil:\nSeen mainly in low-rainfall areas.\nAlso known as Omnibus group.\nPorous, friable structure.\nAbsence of lime, kankar (impure calcium carbonate).\nDeficient in: lime, phosphate, manganese, nitrogen, humus, and potash.\nColor: Red because of Ferric oxide. The lower layer is reddish-yellow or yellow.\nTexture: Sandy to clay and loamy.\nWheat, cotton, pulses, tobacco, oilseeds, potatoes, etc. are cultivated.\nBlack soil / regur soil:\nRegur means cotton \u2013 the best soil for cotton cultivation.\nMost of the Deccan is occupied by Black soil.\nMature soil.\nHigh water retaining capacity.\nSwells and will become sticky when wet and shrink when dried.\nSelf-plowing is a characteristic of black soil as it develops wide cracks when dried.\nRich in: Iron, lime, calcium, potassium, aluminum, and magnesium.\nDeficient in: Nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter.\nColor: Deep black to light black.\nTexture: Clayey.\nLaterite soil:\nName from the Latin word \u2018Later\u2019 which means Brick.\nIt becomes so soft when wet and so hard when dried.\nIn the areas of high temperature and high rainfall.\nFormed as a result of high leaching.\nLime and silica will be leached away from the soil.\nOrganic matter in the soil will be removed fast by the bacteria as it is high temperature and humus will be taken quickly by the trees and other plants. Thus, humus content is low.\nRich in: Iron and Aluminum\nDeficient in: Nitrogen, Potash, Potassium, Lime, Humus\nColor: Red color due to iron oxide.\nRice, Ragi, Sugarcane, and Cashew nuts are cultivated mainly.\nDesert / arid soil:\nSeen under Arid and Semi-Arid conditions.\nDeposited mainly by wind activities.\nHigh salt content.\nLack of moisture and Humus.\nKankar or Impure Calcium carbonate content is high which restricts the infiltration of water.\nNitrogen is insufficient and Phosphate is normal.\nTexture: Sandy\nColor: Red to Brown.\nPeaty / marshy soil:\nAreas of heavy rainfall and high humidity.\nThe growth of vegetation is very low.\nA large quantity of dead organic matter/humus which makes the soil alkaline.\nHeavy soil with black color.\nPeaty and marshy soils are found in areas with high water tables, such as the Kerala backwaters and parts of northeastern India. They have high organic content but can be acidic.\nThese soils can support wetland agriculture and are suitable for rice and aquatic crops.\nForest soil:\nForest and hill soils are found in densely forested regions and higher altitudes. They are typically acidic and often have a shallow topsoil layer.\nThese soils are essential for maintaining forest ecosystems but are not suitable for intensive agriculture.\nMountain soil:\nImmature soil with low humus and acidic.\nMountain soils are found in hilly and mountainous regions, including the Himalayas. They are highly weathered and can vary in composition depending on local conditions.\nThese soils are suitable for horticulture, tea, and temperate crops like apples and potatoes.\nSaline and Alkaline Soils:\nSaline and alkaline soils are found in coastal areas and arid regions. They have high levels of salts and alkalis, making them unsuitable for most crops.\nThese soils can be reclaimed for agriculture through drainage and soil amendments.\n\nPS: Also refer to the article \u2018Different soil types in India: Understand the differences\u2018 for a comparative study.

    "[CONTENT] #84": "Even though our country is blessed with wide varieties of soils with high fertility, it is being degraded day by day by various natural and human activities. Farmers in India are complaining about low productivity because of various reasons and soil degradation is one of them.\n\nLoss of soil fertility results in low productivity. It also results in high cost-of-production, low income, food scarcity, loss of biodiversity etc. As food security is a major concern, India has to overcome the challenge of low productivity due to soil degradation. Conservation of soil is the only way to override this problem.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMajor causes of soil degradation\nSoil erosion:\nConsequences of soil erosion\nDecline of soil fertility\nWater logging\nSalinity\nShifting / jhum cultivation\nSoil conservation methods\nModel question based on soil conservation for UPSC Prelims\nMajor causes of soil degradation\nSoil erosion\nDecline of soil fertility\nWater logging\nSalinity\nShifting cultivation\nSoil erosion:\nAmong the agents, water is considered as the main cause of soil erosion.\nMain agents of soil erosion are\u00a0(1)\u00a0Water, (2)\u00a0Wind, (3)\u00a0Waves and (4)\u00a0Glaciers\nRemoval of the top layer of soil by various means, which include both natural events and human activities, is called as soil erosion.\nWater-caused soil erosion can be classified as below:\nSheet Erosion: Uniform removal of the top soil just like a sheet.\nRill Erosion: Heavy water flow cause rill in Land.\nGully Erosion: Rill will enlarge as Gullies and land will be disordered. ( eg: Chambal Valley)\nNote: Wind erosion also causes sheet and rill erosions.\nNote: The largest area affected by soil erosion in India is the State of Rajasthan followed Madhya Pradesh.\nCONSEQUENCES OF SOIL EROSION\n\nFertility of top soil will be lost.\nNutrients content will decline as they are washed away by erosion.\nUnderground water level will be reduced.\nLoss of vegetation and habitat.\nDrought and flood become frequent.\nRivers get dried off.\nAdversely affect the economy and culture.\nNatural hideouts are formed when gully erosion occurs (Ex: Chambal valley was famous for criminal\u2019s hideout).\nDecline of soil fertility\nSoil fertility is mostly affected in the states of Punjab, Haryana, and U.P.\nIt is a condition when the soil is not giving enough production even though adequate irrigation and nutrients are supplied.\nThe major reasons for decline of soil fertility are:\nFrequent cropping\nUnscientific rotation of crops\nExtensive and excessive use of chemical fertilizers\nToo much use of chemical pesticides\nLand should left uncultivated for a period of time and let to retain its fertility. Cropping after cropping will leave the land unfertile.\nLeguminous plants can be cultivated in intervals which will increase the fertility of the soil.\nWater logging\nIf there is no proper drainage system in the land, the land will become waterlogged.\nThis results in the saturation of crops.\nThe normal circulation of air will not be possible due to water logging and the amount of oxygen in the soil will decline.\nConstruction of proper drainage system to allow water flow away from the land is the best way to reduce water logging.\nSalinity\nSoil will become saline or alkaline in low rainfall areas. Rajasthan is an example.\nWhen the sea water enters the land, the soil becomes saline.\nThe presence of calcium carbonate beneath (kankar) the soil will act as impermeable to water and water gets logged as happened in Indira Gandhi canal regions of Rajasthan. If the soil contains salt content, it will spread to the whole land due to this.\nShifting / jhum cultivation\nIt is a type of cultivation practiced mainly in North-Eastern states of India\nIt is a type of slash and burn method of cultivation.\nAfter reaping the crops, the land (usually the forest) is slashed and burned. The next cultivation will be in another plot and the burned land will let uncultivated for a period.\nIn the early periods, the gap between two cultivations in a land was 10-20 years.\nDue to population increase and availability of land is reduced, the gap decreased to merely 2-3 years.\nThis causes major deforestation, environmental pollution, loss of habitat for wild animals etc.\nThe burning of forest results in soil erosion and gradual degradation of soil.\nSoil conservation methods\nAfforestation.\nContour ploughing (cultivation against the direction of the wind).\nStrip cultivation (cultivation in strips).\nFlood control by government initiatives.\nReclamation of bad lands.\nWind breaks in land; like trees at borders.\nOrganic farming.\nControl/restrict shifting cultivation.\nConstruction of proper drainage.\nLeveling of gullies, ravines etc.\nControl of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the market.\nProper awareness about the need of conservation.\nModel question based on soil conservation for UPSC Prelims\n\nQn 1: Among the statements given below, identify the correct statement(s):\n\nOrganic farming has a role to play in soil conservation.\nSheet erosion results in the formation of gullies resulting in loss of underground soil.\nThe largest area affected by soil erosion in India is the State of Rajasthan followed Madhya Pradesh.\n\nChoices:\n\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) 1 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2 and 3\n\nRight Answer:\u00a0c) 1 and 3 only\n\nExplanation: In case of sheet erosion, there will be a uniform removal of the top soil just like a sheet.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nArticle Contributed by: Jijo Sudarsan",

Studies are indicating that UHI is increasing with more people being part of such areas. What are Urban heat islands? How is it affecting the global climate? Read here to find out.\n\nSurface temperatures play a critical role in how hot the surrounding area gets and also present a health risk during extreme heat events.\n\nDuring heat waves, a substantial amount of the sun\u2019s energy is absorbed and reflected by surfaces exposed to its rays, leading to their temperatures increasing significantly.\n\nThe process of urban development greatly changes the landscape. Natural and permeable surfaces are replaced by impermeable structures like buildings and roads. This creates what climatologists refer to as \u201curban heat islands\u201d, areas within cities that experience significantly higher temperatures compared to nearby rural regions.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUrban Heat Islands\nCauses for the formation of heat islands\nImpacts of urban heat islands\nRemedies\nWay forward\nUPSC Civil Services Mains Question\nUrban Heat Islands\n\nUrban heat islands (UHIs) are localized areas within urban environments that experience significantly higher temperatures compared to their surrounding rural areas.\n\nUHIs occur due to human activities, modifications to the landscape, and the concentration of heat-absorbing materials in urban settings. They are a result of the urbanization process and can have various impacts on the environment, public health, and energy consumption.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe phenomenon, \u2018Urban Heat Island\u2019 was first investigated and described by Luke Howard in the 1810s.\n\nCauses for the formation of heat islands\n\nHeat islands form in urban and suburban areas because many common construction materials absorb and retain more of the sun\u2019s heat than natural materials in less developed rural areas.\n\nTemperatures of dark, dry surfaces in direct sun can reach 88\u00b0C during the day, while vegetated surfaces with moist soil under the same conditions might reach only 18\u00b0C.\nConcrete, cement, and metal surfaces in urban areas tend to absorb heat energy rather than reflect it, contributing to higher urban temperatures.\nCities have a low albedo, the reflecting power of a surface. The increased surface area of buildings results in more solar radiation absorption than reflection.\n\nHeat Absorbing Materials: Urban areas are characterized by extensive use of heat-absorbing materials such as asphalt, concrete, and dark-colored buildings. These materials absorb and retain solar radiation, leading to elevated temperatures.\n\nReduced Vegetation: Urbanization often involves the removal of natural vegetation, such as trees and green spaces, which act as cooling agents through evapotranspiration and shading.\n\nHuman Activities: Heat generated by human activities, including industrial processes, vehicular traffic, and energy consumption, contributes to the overall temperature increase in urban areas.\n\nArtificial Heat Sources: The presence of heat sources like air conditioners, industrial processes, and waste heat from buildings and vehicles further exacerbates this.\n\nModified Wind Patterns: Urban landscapes can alter local wind patterns, reducing natural ventilation and trapping warm air within the city.\n\nUrban Form: The density, layout, and design of urban areas can impact the intensity and extent of UHIs. High-rise buildings, narrow streets, and compact urban layouts can intensify heat retention.\n\nRead: Insolation and heat balance of earth\n\nImpacts of urban heat islands\nUHIs lead to higher demand for cooling in buildings, increasing energy consumption, and associated greenhouse gas emissions.\nElevated temperatures in urban areas can cause heat-related illnesses and exacerbate existing health conditions, particularly in vulnerable populations.\nUHIs can contribute to poor air quality, as higher temperatures can enhance the formation of ground-level ozone and other air pollutants.\nUHIs affect the water balance in urban areas, leading to increased runoff and reduced infiltration, affecting stormwater management.\nUHIs can disrupt local ecosystems, impacting flora and fauna and altering natural habitats.\nRemedies\nUrban Planning: Incorporating green spaces, parks, and trees into urban planning can help mitigate UHIs by providing shading and promoting natural cooling.\nCool Roofs and Pavements: Implementing cool roofs and pavements, which reflect sunlight rather than absorb it, can reduce heat absorption in urban areas.\nGreen Roof and Walls: Installing green roofs and walls can help reduce surface temperatures and improve air quality.\nEnergy-Efficient Buildings: Promoting energy-efficient building designs and cool building materials can reduce heat emissions from structures.\nTransportation Planning: Encouraging public transportation, biking, and walking can help reduce vehicular heat emissions.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, cities can effectively mitigate urban heat islands and create more comfortable and sustainable living environments for their residents.\n\nWay forward\n\nCooler, shaded spaces in our parks, near buildings, in streetscapes, and alongside homes can reduce heat stress, particularly for those in our community who are most vulnerable to high temperatures.\n\nNote: Cities in desert environments show a different trend known as the \u201curban oasis effect\u201d. This effect is characterized by a cooler city center compared to the surrounding environments\n\nRead: India Cooling Action Plan\n\nUPSC Civil Services Mains Question\nBring out the causes for the formation of heat islands in the urban habitat of the world.

These factors include physical, economic, social, and historical considerations.\n\nPrimary Sector Industries\nNatural Resources: Industries involved in extracting raw materials, such as agriculture, mining, and forestry, tend to be located near the sources of natural resources.\nFor example, agricultural activities are usually situated in regions with fertile soil and favorable climatic conditions.\nSecondary Sector Industries\nRaw Material Availability: Industries like manufacturing and construction rely on the proximity to raw materials. Regions with easy access to raw materials, such as iron ore for steel production, tend to attract these industries.\nTransportation: Proximity to transportation networks, including roads, railways, and ports, is crucial for the movement of raw materials and finished products. Industries often locate near transportation hubs to minimize costs.\nLabor Availability: Labor-intensive industries are often located where there is a skilled or low-cost labor force. Textile and garment industries, for instance, may be located in regions with a large workforce.\nEnergy Availability: Industries requiring a significant amount of energy, like heavy manufacturing, may be located near energy sources such as coal, hydroelectric power, or oil and gas.\nMarket Proximity: Industries that produce consumer goods may locate close to major markets to reduce transportation costs and reach consumers efficiently.\nGovernment Policies: Incentives and regulations set by governments can influence industry location. Tax breaks, subsidies, and other policies can attract industries to specific regions.\nTertiary Sector Industries\nMarket Demand: Service industries, such as retail, hospitality, and healthcare, are often located in areas with high population densities and strong consumer demand.\nAccess to Customers: Proximity to potential customers is important for many service industries. Businesses like banks and restaurants are often located in commercial and urban centers.\nTransportation and Accessibility: Service industries need good transportation links to serve customers effectively. Airports, highways, and public transportation play a role in location decisions.\nInfrastructure: The availability of modern infrastructure, including communication networks, is important for service industries that rely on information and technology.\nEconomic Base: Tertiary sector industries are often concentrated in urban areas with diverse economic activities and a larger consumer base.\n\nIndustrial locations are complex. These are influenced by the availability of many factors. Some of them are raw materials, land, water, labor, capital, power, transport, and market.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFor ease of convenience, we can classify the location factors into two: geographical factors and non-geographical factors.\n\nGeographical Factors\n\n\u00a0\n\nRaw material: Availability of natural resources that can be used as raw material.\nTechnology: To turn the resource into an asset with value.\nPower: To utilize the technology.\nLabor: Human resources in the area who can function as labor to run the processes.\nTransport: Road/rail connectivity.\nStorage and warehousing.\nMarketing feasibility.\nCharacteristics of land and soil.\nClimate.\nPrecipitation and water resources.\nVulnerability to natural resources.\n\nExplanation:\n\nRaw materials are one of the important factors in an industrial location. The mere location of industries itself may be determined by the availability or location of the raw materials.\nPower \u2013 conventional (coal, mineral oil, or hydroelectricity) or- conventional is a necessity for any industrial establishment.\nThe availability of labor or a skilled workforce is the success mantra for the growth of all industries.\nThe availability of easy transportation always influences the location of the industry. So the junction points of waterways, roadways, and railways become humming centers of industrial activity.\nThe finished goods should reach the market at the end of the process of manufacturing. Thus nearness to the market is an add-on quality in the process of selecting a location for industry.\nThe availability of water is another factor that influences the industrial location. Many industries are established near rivers, canals, and lakes, because of this reason. Iron and steel industries, textile industries, and chemical industries require large quantities of water, for their proper functioning.\nThe site that is selected for the establishment of an industry must be flat and well-served by adequate transport facilities.\nThe climate of the area selected for the industry is important, very harsh climates are not suitable for successful industrial growth.\nNon-geographical Factors\nCapital investment.\nAvailability of loans.\nInvestment climate.\nGovernment policies/regulations.\nInfluence of pressure groups.\n\nExplanation:\n\nCapital or huge investment is needed for the establishment of industries.\nGovernment policies are another factor that influences industrial location. The government sets certain restrictions in the allocation of land for industries to reduce regional disparities, control excessive pollution, and avoid the excessive clustering of industries in big cities.\nIndustrial inertia is the predisposition of industries or companies to avoid relocating facilities even in the face of changing economic circumstances that would otherwise induce them to leave. Often the costs associated with relocating fixed capital assets and labor far outweigh the costs of adapting to the changing conditions of an existing location.\nEfficient and enterprising organization and management are essential for running the modem industry successfully.\nThe location that has better banking facilities and Insurance are best suited for the establishment of industries.\n\nIt is rarely possible to find all these factors available in one place. Consequently, manufacturing activity tends to be located at the most appropriate place where all the factors of industrial location are either available or can be arranged at a lower cost.\n\nIn general, it should also be noted that both lower production cost and lower distribution cost are the two major factors when considering the location of an industry. Sometimes, the government provides incentives like subsidized power, lower transport costs, and other infrastructure so that industries may be located in backward areas.\n\nIndustrial System\n\nAn industrial system consists of inputs, processes, and outputs. The inputs are the raw materials, labor, and costs of land, transport, power, and other infrastructure.\n\nThe processes include a wide range of activities that convert the raw material into finished products. The outputs are the end product and the income earned from it. In the case of the textile industry, the inputs may be cotton, human labor, factory, and transport costs.\n\nThe processes include ginning, spinning, weaving, dyeing, and printing. The output is the shirt you wear.\n\nIndustrialization and Urbanization\n\nAfter an industrial activity starts, urbanization follows. Sometimes, industries are located in or near the cities. Thus, industrialization and urbanization go hand in hand. Cities provide markets and also provide services such as banking, insurance, transport, labor, consultants financial advice, etc. to the industry.\n\nAgglomeration Economies\n\nMany industries tend to come together to make use of the advantages offered by the urban centers known as agglomeration economies. Gradually, a large industrial agglomeration takes place.\n\nFactors Responsible for the Location of Primary Secondary and Tertiary Sector Industries in India\n\nIn the pre-independence period, most manufacturing units were located in places from the point of view of overseas trade such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, etc.\n\nConsequently, there emerged certain pockets of industrially developed urban centers surrounded by a huge agricultural rural hinterland.\n\nIndia\u2019s primary sector industries, like agriculture, are influenced by factors such as climate, soil fertility, and water availability.\nSecondary industries often located near raw material sources, such as steel plants near iron ore deposits.\nTertiary sector industries are often found in urban areas with a dense population and consumer demand, such as cities with IT hubs.\n\nA combination of factors unique to each sector and region shapes the location of industries around the world, contributing to regional economic development and specialization.\n\nRelated posts\nIndustrial Regions of India\nDistribution of Major Industries: Location Factors",

The inputs for the industry include raw materials such as iron ore, coal, and limestone, along with labor, capital, site, and other infrastructure. The process of converting iron ore into steel involves many stages. The raw material is put in the blast furnace where it undergoes smelting. It is then refined. The output obtained is steel which may be used by other industries as raw material.\n\nThe Indian iron and steel industry consists of large integrated steel plants as well as mini steel mills. It also includes secondary producers, rolling mills, and ancillary industries.\n\nChanges in locations: Before 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry was located where raw materials, power supply and running water were easily available. Later the ideal location for the industry was near coal fields and close to canals and railways. After 1950, iron and steel industry began to be located on large areas of flat land near sea ports. This is because by this time steel works had become very large and iron ore had to be imported from overseas.\n\nLocations in India: In India, iron and steel industry has developed taking advantage of raw materials, cheap labour, transport and market. All the important steel producing centres such as Bhilai, Durgapur, Burnpur, Jamshedpur, Rourkela, Bokaro are situated in a region that spreads over four states \u2014 West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Bhadravati and Vijay Nagar in Karnataka, Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Salem in Tamil Nadu are other important steel centres utilising local resources. India\u2019s steel production increased from one million tonne in 1947 to 30 million tonnes in 2002.\n\nWhy Jamshedpur?\u00a0Before 1947, there was only one iron and steel plant in the country \u2013 Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO). It was privately owned. After Independence, the government took the initiative and set up several iron and steel plants. TISCO was started in 1907 at Sakchi, near the confluence of the rivers Subarnarekha and Kharkai in Jharkhand. Later on Sakchi was renamed as Jamshedpur. Geographically, Jamshedpur is the most conveniently situated iron and steel centre in the country.\n\nSakchi was chosen to set up the steel plant for several reasons. This place was only 32 km away from Kalimati station on the Bengal-Nagpur railway line. It was close to the iron ore, coal and manganese deposits as well as to Kolkata, which provided a large market. TISCO gets coal from Jharia coalfields, and iron ore, limestone, dolomite and manganese from Odisha and Chhattisgarh. The Kharkai and Subarnarekha rivers ensured sufficient water supply. Government initiatives provided adequate capital for its later development.\n\nThe development of the iron and steel industry opened the doors to rapid industrial development in India. Almost all sectors of the Indian industry depend heavily on the iron and steel industry for their basic infrastructure.\n\nWhy Pittsburgh?\u00a0It is an important steel city of the United States of America. The steel industry at Pittsburgh enjoys locational advantages. Some of the raw material such as coal is available locally, while the iron ore comes from the iron mines at Minnesota, about 1500 km from Pittsburgh. Between these mines and Pittsburgh is one of the world\u2019s best routes for shipping ore cheaply \u2013 the famous Great Lakes waterway. Trains carry the ore from the Great Lakes to the Pittsburgh area. The Ohio, the Monogahela and Allegheny rivers provide adequate water supply.\n\nToday, very few of the large steel mills are in Pittsburgh itself. They are located in the valleys of the Monogahela and Allegheny rivers above Pittsburgh and along the Ohio River below it. Finished steel is transported to the market by both land and water routes. The Pittsburgh area has many factories other than steel mills. These use steel as their raw material to make many different products such as railroad equipment, heavy machinery and rails.\n\nCotton Textile Industry\n\nWeaving cloth from yarn is an ancient art. Cotton, wool, silk, jute, flax have been used for making cloth. The textile industry can be divided on the basis of raw materials used in them. Fibres are the raw material of textile industry. Fibres can be natural or man-made. Natural fibres are obtained from wool, silk, cotton, linen and jute. Man-made fibres include nylon, polyester, acrylic and rayon. The cotton textile industry is one of the oldest industries in the world. Till the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, cotton cloth was made using hand spinning techniques (wheels) and looms. In 18th century power looms facilitated the development of cotton textile industry, first in Britain and later in other parts of the world. Today India, China, Japan and the USA are important producers of cotton textiles.\n\nIndia has a glorious tradition of producing excellent quality cotton textiles. Before the British rule, Indian hand spun and hand woven cloth already had a wide market. The Muslins of Dhaka, Chintzes of Masulipatnam, Calicos of Calicut and Gold-wrought cotton of Burhanpur, Surat and Vadodara were known worldwide for their quality and design. But the production of hand woven cotton textile was expensive and time consuming. Hence, traditional cotton textile industry could not face the competition from the new textile mills of the West, which produced cheap and good quality fabrics through mechanized industrial units.\n\nWhy Mumbai? The first successful mechanized textile mill was established in Mumbai in 1854. The warm, moist climate, a port for importing machinery, availability of raw material and skilled labour resulted in rapid expansion of the industry in the region. Initially this industry flourished in the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat because of favourable humid climate. But today, humidity can be created artificially, and raw cotton is a pure and not weight losing raw material, so this industry has spread to other parts of India. Coimbatore, Kanpur, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ludhiana, Puducherry and Panipat are some of the other important centres.\n\n\u00a0Why\u00a0Ahmedabad?\u00a0It is located in Gujarat on the banks of the Sabarmati river. The first mill was established in 1859. It soon became the second largest textile city of India, after Mumbai. Ahmedabad was therefore often referred to as the \u2018Manchester of India\u2019. Favourable locational factors were responsible for the development of the textile industry in Ahmedabad. Ahmedabad is situated very close to cotton growing area. This ensures easy availability of raw material. The climate is ideal for spinning and weaving. The flat terrain and easy availability of land is suitable for the establishment of the mills. The densely populated states of Gujarat and Maharashtra provide both skilled and semi-skilled labour. Well-developed road and railway network permits easy transportation of textiles to different parts of the country, thus providing easy access to the market. Mumbai port nearby facilitates import of machinery and export of cotton textiles.\n\nBut in the recent years, Ahmedabad textile mills have been having some problems. Several textile mills have closed down. This is primarily due to the emergence of new textile centres in the country as well as non- upgradation of machines and technology in the mills of Ahmedabad. \u00a0\n\nWhy Osaka?\u00a0It is an important textile centre of Japan, also known as the \u2018Manchester of Japan\u2019. The textile industry developed in Osaka due to several geographical factors. The extensive plain around Osaka ensured that land was easily available for the growth of cotton mills. Warm humid climate is well suited to spinning and weaving. The river Yodo provides sufficient water for the mills. Labour is easily available. Location of port facilitates import of raw cotton and for exporting textiles. The textile industry at Osaka depends completely upon imported raw materials. Cotton is imported from Egypt, India, China and USA. The finished product is mostly exported and has a good market due to good quality and low price. Though it is one of the important textile cities in the country, of late, the cotton textile industry of Osaka has been replaced by other industries, such as iron and steel, machinery, shipbuilding, automobiles, electrical equipment and cement.\n\nInformation Technology (IT)\n\nThe information technology industry deals in the storage, processing and distribution of information. Today, this industry has become global. This is due to a series of technological, political, and socio-economic events. The main factors guiding the location of these industries are resource availability, cost and infrastructure. The major hubs of the IT industry are the Silicon Valley, California and Bangalore, India.\n\nWhy Silicon Valley? Silicon Valley is a part of Santa Clara Valley, located next to the Rocky Mountains of North America. The area has temperate climate with the temperatures rarely dropping below 0 degrees centigrade.\n\nWhy Bangalore? Bangalore is located on the Deccan Plateau from where it gets the name \u2018Silicon Plateau\u2019. The city is known for its mild climate throughout the year. There are other emerging information technology hubs in metropolitan centres of India such as Mumbai, New Delhi, Hyderabad and Chennai. Other cities such as Gurgaon, Pune, Thiruvanthapuram, Kochi and Chandigarh are also important centres of the IT industry. However, Bangalore has always had a unique advantage, as a city with highest availability of middle and top management talent.\n\nUPSC Civil Services Main Exam questions related to this topic\nDo you agree that there is a growing trend of opening new sugar mills in the Southern states of India?

Read here to learn more about Indian agriculture.\n\nIndia has one of the largest plain areas in the world Indo-Gangetic Plain which is immensely fertile.\n\nIndia has a variety of climatic conditions and soil types.\n\nThese physical variations along with factors like availability of irrigation, use of machinery, and modern agricultural inputs like High Yielding Varieties (HYV) of seeds, insecticides, and pesticides have played important roles in the evolution of different farming practices in the Indian agriculture sector.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypes of farming in India\ni) Subsistence farming:\nii) Intensive and Extensive farming\niii) Commercial farming\niv) Plantation Farming\nv) Mixed Farming\nFeatures of Indian Agriculture\nChallenges for Indian Agriculture\nIndian Agriculture: Important Facts\nTypes of farming in India\n\nSome of the major types of farming are discussed below.\n\ni) Subsistence farming:\n\nThe majority of farmers in India practice subsistence farming- farming for their consumption. The entire production is largely consumed by the farmers and their families and they do not have any surplus to sell in the market.\n\nIn this type of farming, landholdings are small and fragmented; cultivation techniques are primitive and simple. There is a total absence of modern equipment like tractors and farm inputs like chemical fertilizers, insecticides, and pesticides. In this farming, farmers mostly cultivate cereals along with oilseeds, pulses, vegetables, and sugarcane.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSubsistence farming is further classified into:\n\nIntensive\nPrimitive\n\nPrimitive subsistence agriculture is practised on patches of land with the help of primitive tools like simple digging tools and community or family labour. This type of farming is monsoon depending on the fertility of the soil and other environmental conditions. Examples of such types are shifting agriculture and nomadic herding.\n\nShifting agriculture is practised in thickly forested regions like the Amazon basin, tropical Africa, parts of southeast Asia, and northeast India. These areas receive heavy rainfall hence the vegetation regenerates quickly.\nA patch of land is cleared by felling trees and burning them. The ashes are then mixed with the soil and crops like maize, yam, potatoes, and cassava are grown. The land is abandoned once fertility is reduced.\nNomadic herding is practised in the semi-arid and arid regions of the Sahara, Central Asia, and some parts of India like Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir.\nHerdsmen move from place to place with their animals for fodder and water, along defined routes and such movement arises due to seasonal changes. Animals like sheep, camel, yak, and goats are most commonly reared.\n\nIntensive subsistence agriculture is done on small lands with simple tools and more labour. The produce is enough for local consumption and to be sold outside. The sunny climate and fertile soil for most of the year permit the cultivation of more than one crop annually on the same plot. Rice, wheat, maize, pulses, and oilseeds are generally cultivated.\n\nii) Intensive and Extensive farming\n\nThe basic difference between these two types of farming is the amount of production per unit of land. In comparison temperate areas of the USA, Canada, and India do not practice extensive cultivation.\n\nWhen a large patch of land is used for cultivation then we call it extensive farming. Here, total production may be high due to the larger area but per unit production is low.\n\nIntensive Farming records high production per unit of land. An example of intensive cultivation is in Kerala where the availability of land for cultivation is very limited.\n\niii) Commercial farming\n\nIt is just the opposite of subsistence farming as most of the produce is sold in the market for earning money. In this system, farmers use inputs like irrigation, chemical fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, High Yielding Varieties of seeds, etc.\n\nSome of the major commercial crops grown in different parts of India are cotton, jute, sugarcane, groundnut, etc.\n\nRice farming in Haryana is mainly for commercial purposes as people of this area are predominantly wheat eaters. However, in the East and North-Eastern states of India, rice cultivation would be a large subsistence type.\n\niv) Plantation Farming\n\nIn this type, a single cash crop is grown for sale in national and international markets. This type of agriculture involves the growing and processing of a single cash crop purely meant for sale.\n\nTea, coffee, rubber, bananas, and spices are all examples of plantation crops. Most of these crops were introduced in India by the Britishers in the 19th Century\n\nv) Mixed Farming\n\nWhen both raising crops and rearing animals are carried on simultaneously it is called mixed farming. Farmers engaged in mixed farming have economic advantages as well.\n\nAll classifications are based on the nature and purpose of farming hence they may overlap in some cases. For example, Banana is a plantation type of farming but can also be classified as commercial farming.\n\nFeatures of Indian Agriculture\n\nSubsistence Agriculture: Most parts of India have subsistence agriculture which has been practised in India for several hundreds of years and still prevails.\n\nThe pressure of population on Agriculture: Despite the increase in urbanization and industrialization, about 70% of the population is still directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture.\n\nMechanization in agriculture: Even after more than forty years of the Green Revolution and the revolution in agricultural machinery and equipment, complete mechanization is still not achieved.\n\nMonsoon dependency: Despite the large-scale expansion, only about one-third of the total cropped area is irrigated today. As a consequence, two-thirds of cropped areas are still dependent upon the monsoon.\n\nVariety of crops: Since India has both tropical and temperate climates, crops of both climates are found in India. There are very few countries in the world that have variety comparable to that of India. You would realize that when we would discuss the different types of crops in detail.\n\nThe predominance of food crops: The production of food crops is the priority of the farmers almost everywhere in the country.\n\nSeasonal patterns: India has three distinct agricultural/cropping seasons\u2013 Kharif, rabi, and Zaid. In India, there are specific crops grown in these three seasons. For example, rice is a Kharif crop whereas wheat is a Rabi crop.\n\nChallenges for Indian Agriculture\n\nThe challenges faced by Indian agriculture can be broadly grouped into two categories- the long-standing problems and the emerging issues from the prevailing agricultural practices, system, changing climate, and economy.\n\nStagnation in Production of Major Crops: The production of some of the major staple food crops like rice and wheat has been stagnating for quite some time. This is a situation that is worrying our agricultural scientists, planners, and policymakers as it creates a huge gap between the demand of the ever-growing population and the production.\n\nHigh cost of Farm Inputs: Farm inputs include fertilizer, insecticide, pesticides, HYV seeds, farm labour cost, etc. Such an increase puts low and medium-land-holding farmers at a disadvantage.\n\nSoil Exhaustion: The Green Revolution has played a positive role in reducing hunger in India but has negative consequences also. One of which is Soil exhaustion which means the loss of nutrients in the soil from farming the same crop over and over again.\n\nGroundwater depletion: The second negative consequence of the green revolution is the depletion of fresh groundwater. Most of the irrigation in dry areas of Punjab, Haryana, and Western Uttar Pradesh was carried out by excessive use of groundwater. Today fresh groundwater situation in these states is alarming.\n\nGlobal Climatic Change: It has been predicted that climate change\u2019s impact on Indian agriculture will be immense. It is predicted that due to climate change, the temperature will increase, leading to an increase in sea level, more intense cyclones, unpredictable rainfall, etc. These changes would adversely affect the production of rice and wheat. Specifically, a rise in temperature in winter would affect the production of wheat in north India. Production of rice would be affected in coastal areas of India due to the ingress of saline water and an increase in the frequency of cyclones.\n\nImpact of Globalisation: All developing countries have been affected by globalization. The most evident effect is the reduction in farmers\u2019 income and the threat to the viability of cultivation in India. This is due to the rising input costs and falling output prices. This reflects the combination of reduced subsidy and protection to farmers. Trade liberalization exposes these farmers to competition from highly subsidized production in the developed world.\n\nProviding Food Security: Before the introduction of the green revolution in India, we were not self-sufficient in terms of our food grain production. But last few decades agriculture has not grown with the increasing population and to ensure food security factors like accessibility, affordability as well nutritional value of the food available should be catered to.\n\nFarmers Suicides: The farmer suicides appear concentrated in regions of high commercialization of Indian agriculture and very high peasant debt. Cash crop farmers seemed far more vulnerable than those growing food crops. Commercialization of the countryside along with a massive decline in investment in agriculture was the beginning of the decline. Privatization of many resources has also compounded the problems.\n\nIndian Agriculture: Important Facts\n\nThe Economic Survey of India 2020-21 report stated that in FY20:\n\nThe total food grain production in the country was recorded at 296.65 million tonnes (up by 11.44 million tonnes compared with 285.21 million tonnes in FY19).\nThe government has set a target to buy 42.74 million tonnes from the central pool in FY21; this is 10% more than the quantity purchased in FY20.\nFor FY22, the government has set a record target for farmers to raise food grain production by 2% with 307.31 million tonnes of food grains.\nIn FY21, production was recorded at 303.34 million tonnes against a target of 301 million tonnes\nGross Value Added (GVA) by agriculture, forestry, and fishing was estimated at Rs. 19.48 lakh crore in FY20.\nThe share of agriculture and allied sectors in GVA of India at current prices stood at 17.8 % in FY20.\nConsumer spending in India will return to growth in 2021 after the pandemic-led contraction, expanding by as much as 6.6%.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0\n\nAgriculture export policy\nNew Schemes for Farmers",

However, they have distinct purposes, regulations, and levels of human activity allowed within their boundaries.\n\nBiosphere Reserves are the biggest entity among the three. The level of restriction in the increasing order is Biosphere Reserves, Wildlife Sanctuaries, and National Parks.\n\nThe Indian government has established\u00a018 Biosphere Reserves in India, roughly corresponding to\u00a0IUCN\u00a0Category V Protected areas.\u00a0India\u00a0has over\u00a0441 animal sanctuaries, referred to as Wildlife sanctuaries (IUCN Category IV Protected Area). As of January 2023, there are 567 existing wildlife sanctuaries in India covering an area of\u00a0 125564.86 km2.\n\nThe National Parks of India are IUCN category II protected areas. As of January 2023, there were 106 national parks in India, and more parks are in the process of getting commissioned.\n\nRecent news\n\nUNESCO has approved the designation of 11 new biosphere reserves in 11 countries.

India by ClearIAS\n\nClick here to watch video series on GI Tags in India \u2013 arranged state-wise with photographs.\n\nSummary: GI Tags\nGeographical Indications of Goods are defined as that aspect of industrial property which refers to the geographical indication referring to a country or to a place situated therein as being the country or place of origin of that product.\nTypically, such a name conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness which is essentially attributable to the fact of its origin in that defined geographical locality, region or country.\nUnder Articles 1 (2) and 10 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, geographical indications are covered as an element of IPRs.\nThey are also covered under Articles 22 to 24 of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, which was part of the Agreements concluding the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations.\nProponents of GIs regard them as strong tools for protecting their national property rights. Opponents, however, consider GIs as barriers to trade.\n\nCompiled by: Yuvaalex and Ujwala Pullela",

Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) which is based in Paris, France.\n\nThe International World Heritage Programme administered by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee establishes the sites to be listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe World Heritage Committee is responsible for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention (The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage or the World Heritage Convention), defines the use of the World Heritage Fund and allocates financial assistance upon requests from States Parties.\n\nIt is composed of 21 state parties which are elected by the General Assembly of States Parties for a four-year term.\n\nCurrently, India is a member of the World Heritage Committee.\n\nHow is a World Heritage Site selected?\nThe first step towards the listing is the nomination of a site by the respective government of a country.\nThe site should have an Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) for the World Heritage nomination.\nTo determine the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) for the World Heritage nomination, there are ten enlisted criteria.\nThe proposed nomination must satisfy at least one of these ten criteria.\nThe Nomination File is then evaluated by the International Council on Monuments and Sites and the World Conservation Union.\nThese bodies then make their recommendations to the World Heritage Committee.\nThe Committee meets once per year to determine whether or not to inscribe each nominated property on the World Heritage List and sometimes defers the decision to request more information from the country which nominated the site.\nWhat are the ten criteria for determining Outstanding Universal Value (OUV)?\n(i)\n\t\nto represent a masterpiece of human creative genius;\n\n\n(ii)\n\t\nto exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a\u00a0\u00a0 cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design;\n\n\n(iii)\n\t\nto bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared;\n\n\n(iv)\n\t\nto be an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological\u00a0\u00a0 ensemble or landscape which illustrates (a) significant stage(s) in human history;\n\n\n(v)\n\t\nto be an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture (or cultures), or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change;\n\n\n(vi)\n\t\nto be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance. (The Committee considers that this criterion should preferably be used in conjunction with other criteria.\n\n\n(vii)\n\t\nto contain superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance;\n\n\n(viii)\n\t\nto be outstanding examples representing major stages of earth\u2019s history, including the record of life, significant on-going geological processes in the development of landforms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features;\n\n\n(ix)\n\t\nto be outstanding examples representing significant ongoing ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems and communities of plants and animals;\n\n\n(x)\n\t\nto contain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation.\nHow does this program help the listed site and the country?\n\nWhen a site is inscribed on the World Heritage List, the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation.\n\nGreater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties.\n\nA country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites.\n\nThe site will also get immediate international recognition which boosts the tourism of the country.\n\nAlso read: Gothic Architecture\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites in India\n\nThe Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is the nodal agency for forwarding any request for World Heritage status to any Indian site whether cultural or natural.\n\nBased on the proposals received from the Central or State Government agencies as well as management Trusts, etc., and after their due scrutiny, the Government forwards the nomination dossiers to the World Heritage Center.\n\nIndia now has 35 sites, including 27 cultural properties, seven natural sites and one mixed site, notified as World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe\u00a0latest entries in 2016 were \u2013 (1) Nalanda University (2) Capitol Complex and (3) Khangchendzonga National Park (mixed site).\n\nThe list of places in India that have been granted World Heritage status by UNESCO is given below:\n\nCultural Sites\n1.\n\t\nAgra Fort (1983)\n\t\nDelhi\n\n\n2.\n\t\nAjanta Caves (1983)\n\t\nMaharashtra\n\n\n3.\n\t\nArchaeological Site

When it reaches Namcha Barwa, it takes a U-turn around it and enters India in the state of Arunachal Pradesh.\nHere it is known as the\u00a0Dihang River. In India, it flows through the states of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam and is connected by several tributaries.\nThe Brahmaputra has a braided channel throughout most of its length in Assam.\nThe river is known as the Tsangpo in Tibet. It receives less volume of water and has less silt in the Tibet region.\nBut in India, the river passes through a region of heavy precipitation, and as such, the river carries large amounts of water during rainfall and a significant amount of silt.\nIt is considered one of the largest rivers in India in terms of volume. It is known for creating calamities in Assam and Bangladesh.\n\nRead:\u00a0Transboundary rivers of India\n\nThe Ganga River System\n\nThe Ganga originates as the Bhagirathi from the Gangotri glacier.\nBefore it reaches Devprayag in the Garhwal Division, the Mandakini, Pindar, Dhauliganga and Bishenganga rivers merge into the Alaknanda and the Bheling drain into the Bhagirathi.\nThe Pindar River rises from East Trishul and Nanda Devi unites with the Alaknanda at Karan Prayag. The Mandakini meets at Rudraprayag.\nThe water from both Bhagirathi and the Alaknanda flows in the name of the Ganga at Devprayag.\n\nThe concept of Panch Prayag\n\nVishnuprayag: where the river Alaknanda meets river Dhauli Ganga\nNandprayag: where river Alaknanda meets river Nandakini\nKarnaprayag: where river Alaknanda meets river Pinder\nRudraprayag: where river Alaknanda meets river Mandakini\nDevprayag: where river Alaknanda meets river Bhagirathi -GANGA\n\nThe principal tributaries of the Ganga are Yamuna, Damodar, Sapta Kosi, Ram Ganga, Gomati, Ghaghara, and Son.

Read further to learn more.\n\nLearning about Fossils, their classification, and formation is important for the UPSC Civil Services Mains Exam Optional Subject Geology.\n\nThroughout human history, people have discovered preserved remains and wondered about the creatures that lived long ago. In ancient times, fossils inspired legends of monsters and other strange creatures.\n\nThe griffin, a mythical creature with a lion\u2019s body and an eagle\u2019s head and wings was probably based on skeletons of Protoceratops that were discovered by nomads in Central Asia.\n\nAnother fossil reminded the Greeks of the coiled horns of a ram.

They include body fossils, left behind when the soft parts have decayed away, as well as trace fossils, such as burrows, tracks, or fossilized waste (feces).\nThe process of a once-living organism becoming a fossil is called fossilization. Fossilization is a very rare process: of all the organisms that have lived on Earth, only a tiny percentage of them ever become fossils.\nTypes\n\nFossilization can occur in many ways. Most remains are preserved in one of five processes: preserved remains, permineralization, molds, and casts, replacement, and compression.\n\nPreserved Remains\n\nThe rarest form of fossilization is the preservation of original skeletal material and even soft tissue. For example, insects have been preserved perfectly in\u00a0amber, which is ancient tree sap.\n\nSeveral mammoths and even a Neanderthal hunter have been discovered frozen in glaciers. These preserved remains allow scientists the rare opportunity to examine the skin, hair, and organs of ancient creatures. Scientists have collected DNA from these remains and compared the DNA sequences to those of modern creatures.\n\nPermineralization\n\nThe most common method of fossilization is\u00a0permineralization or Petrification. After a bone, wood fragment, or shell is buried in sediment, it may be exposed to mineral-rich water that moves through the sediment.\n\nThis water will deposit minerals into empty spaces, producing preserved remains. Fossil dinosaur bones, petrified wood, and many marine fossils were formed by permineralization.\n\nMolds and Casts\n\nIn some cases, the original bone or shell dissolves away, leaving behind a space in the shape of the shell or bone. This depression is called a mold. Later the space may be filled with other sediments to form a matching\u00a0cast in the shape of the original organism.\n\nMany mollusks (clams, snails, octopi, and squid) are commonly found as molds and casts because their shells dissolve easily.\n\nReplacement\n\nIn some cases, the original shell or bone dissolves away and is replaced by a different mineral. For example, shells that were originally calcite may be replaced by dolomite, quartz, or pyrite.\n\nIf quartz-preserved\u00a0remains are surrounded by a calcite matrix, the calcite can be dissolved away by acid, leaving behind an exquisitely preserved quartz fossil.\n\nCompression\n\nSome of them form when their remains are compressed by high pressure. This can leave behind a dark imprint of the fossil. Compression is most common for preserved remains of leaves and ferns but can occur with other organisms, as well.\n\nMega fossils and Microfossils\n\nThey can be classified into various types based on their preservation and the size of the remains. The two primary categories are megafossils and microfossils.\n\nMegafossils: These are large preserved remains, visible to the naked eye, and include the remains of organisms such as plants, animals, and larger structures like tree trunks.\n\nTypes:\n\nBody Fossils: These include the preserved parts of an organism\u2019s body, such as bones, teeth, shells, and tissues.\nTrace Fossils: These are indirect evidence of past life activities, including footprints, burrows, and coprolites (fossilized dung).\n\nMicrofossils: They are tiny preserved remains that require microscopic examination for proper observation. They include the remains of microscopic organisms and their byproducts.\n\nTypes:\n\nForaminifera: Single-celled marine organisms with shells, commonly used in paleoclimate studies.\nDiatoms: Microscopic algae with intricate silica shells, often used in environmental and climate research.\nRadiolarians: Planktonic marine protozoa with intricate mineral skeletons.\nDinoflagellates: Microscopic aquatic organisms, often found in marine sediments.\nPollen and Spores: Plant reproductive structures, crucial for studying past vegetation.\nSignificance of Fossils\nEvolutionary Insights: They provide evidence of past life forms and evolutionary changes over millions of years, helping scientists understand the history of biodiversity.\nStratigraphy and Dating:\u00a0They aid in the relative dating of rock layers, allowing researchers to establish the chronological order of geological formations through the principle of faunal succession.\nPaleoenvironmental Reconstruction:\u00a0Fossilized plants and microorganisms help reconstruct past environments, climate conditions, and the distribution of species.\nOil and Gas Exploration:\u00a0Microfossils, such as foraminifera, are used in petroleum exploration as they indicate the presence of oil and gas deposits.\nBiogeography:\u00a0They provide insights into the historical distribution of species and the movement of continents over time.\nMedical and Industrial Applications:\u00a0Fossil-derived resources, such as coal and oil, are crucial for energy production. Additionally, fossils are used in medical research, particularly in understanding the evolution of diseases.\nChallenges in Fossil Study\nIncomplete Preservation:\u00a0The fossilization process is selective, and not all organisms or body parts are preserved. This incompleteness can limit the information available to scientists.\nTaphonomy:\u00a0Taphonomy refers to the study of what happens to an organism\u2019s remains after death. Understanding taphonomic processes is essential for interpreting the reliability of fossil records.\nFossil Bias:\u00a0Certain environments are more conducive to fossilization, leading to a bias in the types of fossils that are preserved. For example, marine environments are more likely to yield preserved remains than terrestrial ones.\nDating Challenges:\u00a0Absolute dating of preserved remains is often challenging, and scientists rely on various dating methods, including radiometric dating, to estimate the age of fossils and associated rocks.\nFossil parks in India\n\nThe Geological Survey of India (GSI) currently maintains two protected areas bearing rich fossil deposits.\n\nShivalik Fossil Park, near Saketi, Himachal Pradesh is notable for its life-size models of the vertebrates that might have roamed the Sivalik Hills 1.5-2.5 million years ago.\nMandla Plant Fossils National Park, near Dindori, Madhya Pradesh is a park that attempts to preserve the fossil remains of a primordial forest that covered the region 40-150 million years ago.\n\nOther parks in India include:\n\nIndroda Dinosaur and Fossil Park, Gujarat\nGhughua Fossil Park, Madhya Pradesh\nSalkhan Fossils Park, Uttar Pradesh\nAkal Wood Fossil Park, Rajasthan\nAmkhoi Fossil Park, West Bengal\nRaiyoli Dinosaur Fossil Park, Gujarat\nRajmahal Hills Fossil Park, Bihar\nWadadham Fossils Park, Wadadam, Sironcha, Gadchiroli, Maharashtra\n\nRead: Why India\u2019s fossil wealth has remained hidden?\n\nConclusion\n\nFossils are invaluable windows into Earth\u2019s past, offering a treasure trove of information for scientists and researchers.\n\nFrom reconstructing ancient ecosystems to understanding evolutionary processes, the study of fossils continues to contribute significantly to our knowledge of the natural world and the history of life on our planet.\n\nAs technology advances, new methods and discoveries will likely enhance our understanding of fossils and their role in unraveling the mysteries of Earth\u2019s history.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nGeological Time Scale\nMass Extinctions\nHolocene Extinction\nMagnetofossils\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

It takes the Sun about 225-250 million years to complete one orbit around the center, known as a cosmic year or galactic year.\nThe Milky Way\u2019s spiral arms contain a higher density of stars and regions of star formation. They appear as bright, winding structures when viewed from a distance.\n\nThe Milky Way is just one of billions of galaxies in the observable universe. It is part of the Local Group, a small cluster of galaxies that also includes the Andromeda Galaxy, the Triangulum Galaxy, and numerous smaller dwarf galaxies.\n\nStudying the Milky Way and its structure is challenging because we are inside it. Astronomers use a variety of tools, including radio and infrared telescopes, to study different regions and components of the galaxy.\n\nSolar system\n\nWe call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity \u2013 the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris \u2013 along with hundreds of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.\n\nOur solar system is the only one we know of that has a planet that supports life. So far, we only know of life on Earth, but we\u2019re looking for life on other worlds.\n\nIt is a small part of the Milky Way galaxy and serves as our cosmic neighborhood.\n\nThe Sun is the central and most massive object in the solar system. It accounts for over 99% of the total mass of the solar system. It is a G-type main-sequence star, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The Sun\u2019s gravitational pull keeps all other objects in the solar system in orbit around it.\n\nPlanets\n\nThere are eight recognized planets in the solar system, divided into two groups:\n\nInner Planets (Terrestrial Planets): These include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They are characterized by their solid surfaces and relatively small sizes. They are often called the \u201cterrestrial planets\u201d because their surfaces are rocky.\nOuter Planets: These include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are sometimes called the Jovian or \u201cJupiter-like\u201d planets because of their enormous size relative to the terrestrial planets. They are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. They lack solid surfaces and have extensive ring systems.\nJupiter and Saturn are sometimes called the gas giants, whereas the more distant Uranus and Neptune have been nicknamed the ice giants. This is because Uranus and Neptune have more atmospheric water and other ice-forming molecules, such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and phosphene, that crystallize into clouds in the planet\u2019s frigid conditions\nDwarf Planets: In addition to the eight planets, there are several dwarf planets in the solar system, including Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres. These objects do not dominate their orbits and share them with other celestial bodies.\nOther components of the Solar system\nMoons (Natural Satellites): Many of the planets and dwarf planets have moons. Earth\u2019s moon is the most well-known. For example, Jupiter has over 80 moons, while Saturn has more than 80 as well.\nAsteroids: Asteroids are rocky, metallic objects that orbit the Sun, primarily located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Some notable asteroids include Ceres, Vesta, and Pallas.\nComets: Comets are icy bodies that travel in elliptical orbits around the Sun. When they approach the Sun, they develop a glowing coma and a tail due to the sublimation of their ice. Famous comets include Halley\u2019s Comet and Comet Hale-Bopp.\nKuiper Belt: Beyond the orbit of Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a region containing numerous small icy bodies and some dwarf planets. Pluto is one of the Kuiper Belt objects.\nOort Cloud: The Oort Cloud is a hypothetical, spherical region surrounding the solar system, where long-period comets are believed to originate. It is much farther from the Sun than the Kuiper Belt.\nInterplanetary Space: The vast regions of space between the celestial objects in the solar system are filled with solar wind, cosmic dust, and electromagnetic radiation.\nDifferent types of solar systems\n\nThe term \u201csolar system\u201d specifically refers to our star system, which includes the Sun and all the celestial bodies orbiting it, such as planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.\n\nHowever, throughout the universe, there are countless star systems, each with its own set of celestial objects.\n\nSingle Star Systems: These are star systems that consist of a single star, like our own solar system with the Sun as the central star.\nBinary Star Systems: Binary star systems contain two stars that orbit a common center of mass. They can be further classified into various types:\nVisual Binaries: These are binary stars that can be observed as two distinct stars through telescopes.\nSpectroscopic Binaries: In these systems, the two stars are so close together that they cannot be visually separated, but their presence is detected through spectroscopic observations.\nEclipsing Binaries: These systems, when observed from Earth, periodically eclipse each other, causing variations in brightness.\nMultiple Star Systems: These systems consist of three or more stars orbiting each other. They can be hierarchical, with pairs of binary stars orbiting each other, or more complex configurations involving multiple stars nearby.\nStellar Clusters: Stellar clusters are groups of stars that are gravitationally bound and have formed from the same molecular cloud. Open clusters contain young stars, while globular clusters are typically older and contain many more stars.\nPlanetary Systems: These systems, like our solar system, consist of one or more planets orbiting a star. Exoplanetary systems are planetary systems outside our solar system.\nStar-Planet Systems: These systems involve a single star and one or more planets that orbit it. These are also known as planetary systems.\nExoplanetary Systems: These systems are located outside our solar system and consist of exoplanets (planets that orbit stars other than the Sun) and their host stars.\nMultiple Planetary Systems: Some stars have multiple planets in orbit around them, and these planetary systems can be complex with various combinations of planets and their orbits.\nPulsar Systems: Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. Some of them are found in binary systems where they can have companion stars.\nWhite Dwarf Systems: In these systems, a white dwarf, which is the remnant of a Sun-like star, may have a companion star. Material from the companion star can accrete onto the white dwarf, leading to periodic outbursts.\nBlack Hole Systems: These systems involve a black hole, an extremely dense region of spacetime, and may include stars or other objects in orbit around the black hole.\nYoung Stellar Objects (YSOs): YSOs are stars in the early stages of formation. These systems often have disks of gas and dust, which may lead to the eventual formation of planetary systems.\nIn news\n\nA new study has revealed more\u00a0spiral galaxies\u00a0in the universe\u2019s youth than astronomers had expected.\n\nThe universe is about 13.8 billion years old and is home to different kinds of galaxies, from spiral to elliptical and those with or without bulges. Astronomers previously believed spiral galaxies formed about 6 billion years ago.\nStill, a new study by a group of astronomers from the University of Missouri in the U.S. has questioned this belief.\nIt was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters on June 11, 2024.\n\nCurrent Theory: Astronomers believe that a large amount of hot gas was present in the cosmos when it cooled from a hot, dense condition. Clusters created by this gas ultimately coalesced to form galaxies.\n\nUnlike spiral galaxies of today, these early galaxies had irregular shapes and lacked flat discs.\nThese galaxies formed thick, hot discs over billions of years as they cooled down; these discs eventually flattened down to become the spiral arms that are familiar to us today.\n\nUnexpected Early Formation: The new analysis implies that spiral galaxies may have originated considerably earlier, at the same time as other forms of galaxies were forming, in contrast to the above idea.\n\nAt least 216 of the 873 galaxies examined in the study\u2014which made use of data from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope\u2014were spiral galaxies.\nThe percentage of spiral-shaped galaxies rose from around 8% to 48% between 3 and 7 billion years after the Big Bang, according to the study.\nThe study\u2019s findings may influence our present knowledge of spiral galaxies\u2019 star formation rates and the prerequisites for the construction of planets similar to Earth.\nFor planet formation, spiral arms formed from supernovae must include heavy materials.\nConclusion\n\nThe solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust. Over time, gravitational forces led to the formation of the Sun and the various objects that make up the solar system.\n\nThe solar system provides a unique window into the study of planetary science, astronomy, and the origins of our cosmic neighborhood.\n\nHere only a few examples of the diverse star systems found throughout the universe are mentioned.

    "[CONTENT] #129": "Given the increasing food demand, environmental degradation, and the challenges posed by climate change, there is an urgent need to transform agri-food systems into sustainable enterprises through scientific innovations. Read here to understand how sustainable agri-food systems can be fostered.\n\nFood systems encompass the entire range of actors and their interlinked value-adding activities involved in the production, aggregation, processing, distribution, consumption, and disposal of food products that originate from agriculture, forestry, or fisheries, and parts of the broader economic, societal, and natural environments in which they are embedded.\n\nThe food system is composed of sub-systems (e.g., farming system, waste management system, input supply system, etc.) and interacts with other key systems (e.g. energy system, trade system, health system, etc.).\n\nTherefore, a structural change in the food system might originate from a change in another system; for example, a policy promoting more biofuel in the energy system will have a significant impact on the food system.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSustainable agri-food systems\nWhy sustainable agri-food systems?\nLimitations of current approaches\nIndia and sustainability of food-agri systems\nConclusion\nSustainable agri-food systems\n\nSustainable agri-food systems refer to a holistic approach to agriculture and food production that aims to meet the needs of the present while preserving the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThese systems are designed to be environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability:\n\nConservation of Resources: Sustainable agriculture aims to minimize the use of non-renewable resources like fossil fuels and synthetic chemicals while maximizing the efficient use of renewable resources like water and soil.\nBiodiversity: The preservation of biodiversity is essential. Sustainable systems promote crop rotation, agroforestry, and the preservation of natural habitats to support diverse ecosystems.\nReduced Environmental Impact: Sustainable agriculture seeks to minimize environmental impacts, such as soil erosion, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, associated with farming practices.\n\nEconomic Sustainability:\n\nEconomic Viability: Farmers and agricultural businesses should be economically viable, able to earn a living, and maintain financial stability.\nMarket Access: Access to markets and fair pricing for agricultural products is essential for economic sustainability.\nValue Addition: Adding value to agricultural products through processing and marketing can enhance the economic sustainability of agri-food systems.\n\nSocial Sustainability:\n\nLabor Conditions: Providing fair wages and decent working conditions for agricultural workers is a fundamental aspect of social sustainability.\nCommunity Well-Being: Sustainable agriculture benefits local communities by creating job opportunities, supporting local economies, and fostering a sense of community well-being.\nAccess to Healthy Food: Ensuring that all members of society have access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food is a social sustainability goal.\nWhy sustainable agri-food systems?\n\nA food system must be considered in the context of rapid population growth, urbanization, growing wealth, changing consumption patterns, and globalization as well as climate change and the depletion of natural resources.\n\nThe developments in food systems have yielded many positive results, especially over the past three decades in developing countries.\n\nThese results include the expansion of off-farm employment opportunities as food industries have developed, and the widening of food choices beyond local staples, thus satisfying consumers\u2019 preferences in terms of taste, form, and quality.\n\nFood Security and Nutrition:\n\nSustainable agri-food systems prioritize food security by aiming to produce a sufficient and consistent supply of food to meet the population\u2019s nutritional needs.\nNutrient-dense and diverse food production is promoted to address nutritional deficiencies and improve overall health.\n\nResilience:\n\nBuilding resilience in agri-food systems involves practices and policies that help agriculture withstand and recover from shocks such as extreme weather events, pests, and diseases.\n\nTechnology and Innovation:\n\nSustainable systems incorporate innovative technologies that improve resource use efficiency, reduce waste, and enhance agricultural productivity.\n\nReduced Waste and Loss: Sustainable agri-food systems seek to reduce food waste and loss at various stages of production, distribution, and consumption.\n\nLocal and Organic Farming: Supporting local and organic farming practices is often a key element of sustainable agri-food systems, as they tend to have lower environmental impacts and promote healthier food.\n\nKnowledge Transfer: Sustainable agriculture involves the transfer of knowledge and best practices to farmers and stakeholders to improve the sustainability of farming techniques.\n\nPolicy and Regulation: Governments play a critical role in shaping sustainable agri-food systems through policies and regulations that support responsible and sustainable practices.\n\nConsumer Awareness and Demand: Consumer choices can drive the sustainability of agri-food systems by supporting products and practices that align with their values and sustainability goals.\n\nGlobal Collaboration: Many sustainability challenges in agri-food systems are global. Collaboration among countries and international organizations is crucial to address issues such as climate change, trade, and food security.\n\nLimitations of current approaches\n\nThe complexity of food systems requires a more holistic and coordinated approach. Many food security and nutrition challenges are complex problems whose solutions are contested and which transcend disciplinary, divisional, and institutional boundaries.\n\nIn increasingly globalized food systems, these challenges result from interactions across different scales and levels. They require integrated actions taken by all stakeholders at local, national, regional, and global levels, by both public and private actors, and across multiple fronts- not only in agriculture, but also trade, policy, health, environment, gender norms, education, transport and infrastructure, and so on.\nIt requires a synergetic merging rather than a destructive clashing of the ideas emerging from these various angles.\nTraditional food security programs tend to adopt a production-focused approach, which seeks to directly influence food security through increasing the supply of food.\nIn a few regions of the world, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, inadequate food production is still the major cause of food and nutrition insecurity.\n\nHowever, the dramatic pace of food system changes over the past decades has brought about complex interactions and feedback loops that impact food security and nutrition in many different ways.\n\nThe focus on food production leads to the neglect of other areas in which the root causes of the food system\u2019s underperformance, as well as the leverage points to bring about the biggest impacts, can often be found.\nFurthermore, the interwoven interactions and feedback in the food system mean that direct interventions in one area risk creating or exacerbating problems in another.\nIndia and sustainability of food-agri systems\n\nIndia has been working towards transforming agri-food systems into sustainable enterprises through scientific innovations. But there are still more aspects to be cared for.\n\nAgricultural scientists should strive to infuse greater mechanization in the agriculture production process and develop and popularise specialized farm implements for women in agriculture.\nThe Sagar Parkirama drive shed more light on marine and inland water pollution that has seriously affected aquatic life and coastal ecology.\nTraditional farm products such as pokkali rice need to be promoted and measures are to be taken to ensure profitability for the pokkali farmers.\nMinimising post-harvest losses is equivalent to boosting production and this can be achieved by focusing attention on advanced technological interventions.\n\nThe future of India\u2019s agriculture depends a lot on how the accumulated scientific knowledge can be translated to commercial success.\n\nConclusion\n\nSustainable agri-food systems are about achieving a balance between economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental responsibility in agriculture and food production. These systems seek to ensure that agriculture not only provides for today\u2019s needs but also preserves resources for future generations while promoting health, equity, and resilience.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nGreen Agriculture\nBlue Food\nAgroforestry\nOrganic Farming\nAgri-food policies for Soil, water, air, and biodiversity\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which runs down the center of the Atlantic, is one of the longest mountain ranges on Earth.\n\nMid-Atlantic Ridge\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a prominent underwater mountain range that extends along the center of the Atlantic Ocean from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean in the south.\n\nIt marks a divergent plate boundary, where the Eurasian, North American, South American, African, and Antarctic Plates are moving away from each other.\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge is characterized by rugged, volcanic peaks and deep rift valleys.\nThe ridge is known as Dolphin Rise to the north and Challenger Rise to the south of the equator.\nIt is known as Wyville Thompson Ridge between Iceland and Scotland.\nThe ridge becomes quite extensive to the south of Greenland and Iceland and is called the Telegraphic Plateau because the first cables were laid down in this area.\nAzores Rise bifurcates from the mid-Atlantic Ridge to the south of 40\u00b0N latitude and ex\u00adtends up to the Azores Islands.\nOther fracture zones are also well marked, Gibbs Fracture Zone (near 40\u00b0N), Atlantis Fracture Zone (near 30\u00b0N), Oceanographic Fracture Zone (32\u00b0N), Kane Fracture Zone (25\u00b0N), Vema Fracture Zone (10\u00b0N), Romancha Fracture Zone (near equator) etc.\nTrenches and Basins\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean features several deep-sea trenches, which are formed at convergent plate boundaries where one tectonic plate is subducting beneath another.\n\nThe Puerto Rico Trench, located north of Puerto Rico, is one of the deepest trenches in the Atlantic Ocean.\nSouth Sandwich trench is located in the South Atlantic Ocean, east of South America. It is a subduction zone where the South American Plate is descending beneath the Scotia Plate. The trench is associated with volcanic activity in the South Sandwich Islands.\n\nMid-Ocean Basins\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean is divided into several deep ocean basins, including the North Atlantic Basin, the South Atlantic Basin, and the Sargasso Sea. These basins vary in size and depth and are surrounded by the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.\n\nNorth Atlantic Basin: This is the northernmost part of the Atlantic Ocean, extending from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the south. It includes the Labrador Sea, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea, and parts of the Barents Sea.\nSouth Atlantic Basin: This is the southern counterpart to the North Atlantic Basin, stretching from the southern tip of South America to the African continent. It includes the Argentine Basin, the Brazil Basin, and the Falkland Plateau.\nBermuda-Azores-Canary Triangle: This triangular region in the North Atlantic Ocean includes the Bermuda Islands, the Azores Islands, and the Canary Islands. It is a geologically complex area with volcanic islands and seamounts.\nNorth Equatorial Basin: This basin is situated in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean, between the Caribbean Sea and the African coast. It is influenced by the North Equatorial Current and features warm waters.\nContinental Shelves and Continental Slopes\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean has extensive continental shelves along its coastlines. These are shallow, submerged platforms that extend from the continents into the ocean. They are important for marine ecosystems and are often used for fishing and oil and gas exploration.\n\nBeyond the continental shelves, the seafloor gradually slopes downward toward the deep ocean basins. This transition is known as the continental slope. It is a region of steep underwater cliffs and canyons.\n\nBottom topography of Atlantic Ocean: other features\n\nAbyssal Plains\n\nAbyssal plains are flat, sediment-covered regions of the deep ocean floor. They are found in the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s deep basins, away from the continental margins. Abyssal plains are some of the flattest and most featureless areas on Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nSeamounts\n\nSeamounts are underwater mountains that rise abruptly from the seafloor. The Atlantic Ocean contains numerous seamounts, some of which were formed by volcanic activity. Some seamounts may approach the ocean\u2019s surface, creating a habitat for marine life.\n\nGuyots\n\nGuyots are flat-topped seamounts that were once above sea level but have since subsided. They are often found in the deeper parts of the Atlantic Ocean and provide insight into past sea-level changes.\n\nSargasso Sea\n\nThe Sargasso Sea is a unique region in the North Atlantic Ocean characterized by calm, clear waters and the presence of Sargassum seaweed. It is located within the North Atlantic Gyre and is a critical habitat for marine life.\n\nCaribbean Sea\n\nWhile not a basin within the Atlantic Ocean itself, the Caribbean Sea is an enclosed sea surrounded by the Caribbean islands and the eastern coasts of Central and South America. It is connected to the Atlantic Ocean through various straits and passages.\n\nRift Valleys\n\nIn addition to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, there are several rift valleys and fracture zones that traverse the Atlantic Ocean floor. These are associated with tectonic plate movements and are marked by geological features like faults and ridges.\n\nOcean deeps\n\nThe number of deeps in the Atlantic Ocean is less than in the Pacific Ocean because of the absence of the effects of Tertiary orogenic movements along the Atlantic coasts.\n\nA few examples are Nares Deep, Puerto Rico Deep, Hatteras Deep, Columbia Deep (south of Haiti), Valdivia Deep, Buchanan Deep, Moseley Deep, Vema Deep, etc.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe bottom topography of the Atlantic Ocean is continually evolving due to plate tectonics, erosion, sedimentation, and other geological processes.\n\nIt is a fascinating and dynamic part of the Earth\u2019s surface, with significant implications for oceanography, geology, and marine biology.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Bottom topography of Pacific Ocean;\u00a0Bottom topography of Indian Ocean\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

To answer these questions, read further.\n\nIn 1957 McKenzie and Parker suggested the plate tectonic theory. The theory was propounded in 1967 by Morgan by taking some attributes from all previous theories of geomorphology.\n\nBoth conventional current theory and seafloor spreading theory paved the way for the theory of plate tectonics.\n\nThe theory provides substantial and scientific evidence about the present configuration of the first order and the process of origin of every second-order relief feature.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPlate Tectonic Theory\nThe theory of plate tectonics is based on 4 general geomorphological assumptions\nThe first orderly relief features\nEvidence in support of separation\nThe origin of the second orderly relief features\nConvergent Boundaries\nDivergent Boundaries\nTransform Boundaries\nMajor Tectonic Plates\nMinor Tectonic Plates\nSignificance of plate tectonic theory\nConclusion\nPlate Tectonic Theory\n\nThe plate tectonic theory is a fundamental concept in geology that explains the movement of the Earth\u2019s lithospheric plates, which make up the Earth\u2019s outermost shell.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the dynamic processes that shape the Earth\u2019s surface, including the formation of continents, ocean basins, mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic activity.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s lithosphere is divided into several large and smaller plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. These plates are made up of the Earth\u2019s crust and the uppermost part of the mantle.\nPlate tectonics is driven by the movement of the Earth\u2019s mantle, specifically convection currents. The heat from the Earth\u2019s interior causes the mantle to convect, creating circulation patterns. This movement of material in the mantle drags the overlying lithospheric plates with it.\n\nPlate Boundaries:\n\nThe boundaries between these lithospheric plates are where most of the Earth\u2019s geological activity occurs. There are three main types of plate boundaries:\n\nDivergent Boundaries: Plates move away from each other. This can result in the formation of mid-ocean ridges and rift valleys.\nConvergent Boundaries: Plates move toward each other. When oceanic plates collide with continental plates, subduction zones, and mountain ranges can form. Oceanic-continental convergence can lead to volcanic arcs. Continental-continental convergence can create high mountain ranges.\nTransform Boundaries: Plates slide past each other horizontally. This can lead to strike-slip faults and earthquakes.\nThe theory of plate tectonics is based on 4 general geomorphological assumptions\nFirstly the slab or zone of the lithosphere is divided into several vertical columns geomorphological known as plates drifting kinematically over a semi-molten asthenosphere called a tectonic.\nSecondly, the surface area of a continental plate is also extended over the oceanic lithosphere. Thus, there is no complete segregation between the continental and the oceanic lithosphere. In this way, the theory again rejects the primary contention of Alfred Wegener that Continental sial and oceanic Sima are two different lithospheric entities.\nThirdly, the movement or tectonics of the respective plates depends on the direction and the impulse action of the thermal Convection currents. consequently, the plates are converging and also divergent away from each other.\nLastly, the process of convergence and divergence further creates a new crust over the Earth\u2019s surface and also disintegrates the crust apart. The rate of formation and disintegration of the crust has acquired a profile of equilibrium by which the surface area of the earth remains constant.\nThe first orderly relief features\n\nAccording to the plate tectonic theory, in the carboniferous period, the Pangea was segregated into two disrupted Continental blocks by the divergence of convection currents and the location of hotspots between the blocks.\n\nThe southern block of Gondwanaland further cross a hotspot and get segregated into the Northern and Southern block. In the present geological timescale, the southern block is known as Antarctica, and the northern block is the plates of South America, Africa, India, and Australia.\n\nThe physical location of the Indian block was initially between the plates of Africa and Antarctica and for the last 200 million years, the continental block of India has been drifting northeast over the asthenosphere.\n\nApproximately 120 million years ago the physical location of the Indian block was near the equator and at the same time, the plate of India was segregated from the continental blocks of Africa.\n\nEvidence in support of separation\n\nThe plate tectonic theory is supported by various lines of evidence, including:\n\nThe fit of continents (e.g., the jigsaw puzzle fit of South America and Africa)\nThe distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes along plate boundaries\nThe age of oceanic crust (youngest at mid-ocean ridges and oldest at continental margins)\nThe magnetic striping pattern of oceanic crust\n\nThe evidence in support of such separation is very well-identified along the eastern and western margin of the Africa Indian block respectively, characterized by the presence of the central fault line and volcanic deposition.\n\nWith time, the plate of Australia also gets segregated from the Indian block and substantial shreds of evidence of such tectonic movements are identified in the center of the Indian Ocean by the presence of the Central fault line and made Indian oceanic ridge.\n\nThe tectonic movement of respective plates and segregation of Continental blocks for each other further created an intervening space between the horizontally displacing block filled by oceanic water of Panthalassa to give rise to oceanic basins like the Pacific, Atlantic, and the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe origin of the second orderly relief features\n\nDue to the plate tectonic theory, we got to know that the major geomorphological features such as fold and block mountains, mid-oceanic ridges, trenches, volcanism, earthquakes, etc. are a direct consequence of the interaction between the various lithospheric plates.\n\nThree different types of tectonic borders:\n\nWhere plates collide is a convergence.\nDivergent, in which the plates separate.\nWhen plates transform, they shift sideways concerning one another.\n\nThe interactions between plates are responsible for a wide range of geological phenomena, including the formation of mountain ranges (e.g., the Himalayas), ocean basins (e.g., the Atlantic Ocean), earthquakes along faults, volcanic eruptions, and the creation and destruction of oceanic crust.\n\nThe behavior of plates at their margins varies depending on the type of boundary. For example, at convergent boundaries, subduction zones can lead to the recycling of oceanic crust into the mantle, while at divergent boundaries, new crust is formed.\n\nConvergent Boundaries\nWhen tectonic plates collide with one another, a convergent plate boundary is created. They are known as term \u201cdestructive boundaries\u201d as well.\nThese borders are frequently subduction zones, where a deep trench is formed as a heavier plate slides beneath a lighter plate.\nIn addition to creating subduction zones, convergent plate boundaries can cause mountain ranges and island arcs to form.\nThe collision can lead to the subduction of one plate beneath another, where one plate is pushed into the Earth\u2019s mantle, creating deep-sea trenches, volcanic arcs, and earthquakes.\nWhen two continental plates collide, they can also create large mountain ranges.\n\nConvergence can happen in three different ways:\n\nbetween a continental and oceanic plate (Andes Mountains)\nbetween two continental plates (The Himalayas)\ntwo oceanic plates (Mariana Trench)\nDivergent Boundaries\nThe breaking apart of tectonic plates creates a divergent boundary. The term \u201cconstructive boundaries\u201d refers to them.\nAt divergent plate boundaries, tectonic plates move away from each other.\nThis movement creates tensional stress that results in the formation of a new crust. As the plates separate, magma from the mantle rises to fill the gap, leading to the formation of mid-ocean ridges.\nDivergent boundaries are often associated with volcanic activity and earthquakes, although the earthquakes tend to be relatively mild compared to those at other types of plate boundaries.\nRift valleys and seafloor spreading are found at divergent boundaries.\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which divides the American Plate from the Eurasian and African Plates, is the most well-known example of diverging borders.\nExamples: Mid-Atlantic Ridge, East African Rift, Mid-Indian Ridge\nTransform Boundaries\nTectonic plates glide past one another horizontally to form a transform boundary, however, some of these plates become stuck where they touch.\nDue to plate interaction, the crust is neither created nor destroyed, hence these boundaries are conservative. As a result, they don\u2019t create amazing features like mountains or oceans.\nStress builds in these points of contact, causing the rocks to break or slide. Faults are these slippage or breakage regions. The majority of Earth\u2019s faults are located in the Ring of Fire along transform boundaries.\nTransform boundaries are often associated with significant seismic activity and can produce powerful earthquakes.\nExamples: San Andreas Fault (North American Plate and Pacific Plate); North Anatolian Fault (Eurasian Plate and Anatolian Plate); Alpine Fault (Pacific Plate and Indo-Australian Plate).\n\nIn addition to these primary types of plate boundaries, there are complex regions where the interactions between plates are not neatly categorized into one type. These regions can exhibit a combination of features associated with divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries.\n\nMajor Tectonic Plates\n\nAntarctica and the surrounding oceanic plate\nNorth American plate\nSouth American plate\nPacific plate\nIndia-Australia-New Zealand plate\nAfrica with the eastern Atlantic floor plate\nEurasia and the adjacent oceanic plate\nMinor Tectonic Plates\nArabian plate: Mostly the Saudi Arabian landmass\nBismark Plate (North Bismarck Plate & South Bismarck Plate)\nCaribbean plate\nCarolina plate [straddles the Equator in the eastern hemisphere located north of New Guinea]\nCocos Plate\nJuan de Fuca Plate (between Pacific and North American plates)\nNazca plate\nPhilippine plate: Between the Asiatic and Pacific plate\nPersian Plate\nThe Anatolian Plate [or the Turkish Plate is a continental tectonic plate comprising most of the Anatolia (Asia Minor) peninsula and the country of Turkey.\nChina plate.\nFiji Plate ( located b/w the Pacific Plate and the Indo-Australia Plate )\nSignificance of plate tectonic theory\n\nPlate tectonics explains the distribution of continents and oceans, the formation of mountain ranges, the opening and closing of ocean basins, and the generation of geological hazards such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nPlate tectonics is responsible for creating almost all significant landforms.\nMagmatic eruptions cause the core to spew out new materials.\nMinerals with high economic value, such as copper and uranium, are located close to plate borders.\nThe future shape of landmasses can be anticipated using the current understanding of crustal plate movement.\nFor instance, North and South America will split if current patterns continue. The east coast of Africa will split off into a new region. Australia will approach Asia.\nConclusion\n\nThe great unifying theory of geosciences that describes how continents move is called plate tectonics. Most significant landforms on Earth\u2019s surface, such as mountains, mid-ocean ridges, and the production of the new lithosphere are caused by volcanism and earthquakes.\n\nThe plate tectonic theory has revolutionized our understanding of the Earth\u2019s geology and has become a unifying principle in the field of earth sciences.\n\nIt provides a framework for explaining the dynamic processes that have shaped the Earth\u2019s surface over millions of years and continue to do so today.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav.",

During the positive phase, the eastern North Pacific tends to be warmer than average, while during the negative phase, it tends to be cooler than average.\nThe positive phase is characterized by cool SSTs north of Hawaii and warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures along the western coast of North America.\nThe negative phase is a mirror image with warm ocean temperatures in the Central North Pacific and cooler than normal waters along the western coast of North America.\n\nSpatial Patterns:\n\nThe positive phase is associated with a horseshoe-shaped pattern of above-average sea surface temperatures, with warm waters extending along the western coast of North America and into the central North Pacific.\nIn the negative phase, the pattern is reversed, with cooler waters along the western coast of North America.\n\nDuration:\n\nThe PDO is a long-term climate pattern that typically lasts for 20 to 30 years in one phase before transitioning to the opposite phase. However, the timing and duration of these phases can vary considerably.\n\nNatural Climate Variability:\n\nThe PDO is considered a part of natural climate variability and is driven by a combination of oceanic and atmospheric processes.\nIt is not directly related to human-induced climate change, although it can interact with and modulate the effects of climate change in certain regions.\nImpact of Pacific Decadal Oscillation\n\nThe PDO can influence weather patterns, ocean conditions, and ecosystems over a wide area, including North America and the North Pacific region.\n\nPositive Phase Impacts\nDuring the positive phase, it is often associated with milder winters in the western United States, increased rainfall in the Pacific Northwest, and changes in marine ecosystems.\nThe Northern Rockies and the Midwest are likely to be drier than normal, while Texas, the Gulf states, and the East are likely to be wetter than normal.\nDuring the positive phase of the PDO in the northern hemisphere wintertime, much of Asia is usually cooler than normal, with above-normal temperatures more likely over India.\nAt the same time, China and Japan are likely to be drier than normal, while India often has a winter that is wetter than normal.\nNegative Phase Impacts\nDuring the negative phase, it can lead to colder winters in the western U.S., drier conditions in the Pacific Northwest, and different marine ecosystem dynamics.\nMany parts of the US will see drier than normal weather, but there are some notable exceptions.\nDuring a negative PDO, winter rainfall is usually above normal for the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys as well as the Northern Rockies and Plains.\nDuring the negative phase of the PDO in the northern hemisphere wintertime, much of India and China is usually cooler than normal, But Japan has warmer than normal weather, especially in the North.\nAt the same time, Japan and Northwest China are usually wetter than normal, while Southwest China and much of India are usually wetter than normal\nPDO vs ENSO\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the PDO is distinct from ENSO, which operates on a shorter timescale (typically 2 to 7 years) and involves interactions between the ocean and atmosphere in the tropical Pacific.\n\nHowever, there can be interactions between the PDO and ENSO, where the phase of one pattern can influence or reinforce the phase of the other.\n\nParameter\n\n\t\nPDO\n\t\n\nENSO\n\n\n\n\nTimescale\n\n\t\nThe PDO is a long-term climate pattern that varies on decadal to multi-decadal timescales, typically ranging from 20 to 30 years for each phase.\n\t\nENSO is a shorter-term climate phenomenon, with irregular cycles that typically last 2 to 7 years. It has two primary phases: El Ni\u00f1o (warm) and La Ni\u00f1a (cool), with a neutral phase in between.\n\n\n\nNature\n\n\t\nThe PDO is characterized by a shift in sea surface temperature (SST) patterns in the North Pacific Ocean. It involves the alternation between warm (positive) and cool (negative) phases.\n\t\nENSO involves changes in sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure patterns in the tropical Pacific Ocean, primarily in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific.\n\n\n\nGeographic scope\n\n\t\nThe PDO affects the entire North Pacific Ocean, from the west coast of North America to Japan and beyond.\n\t\nENSO\u2019s primary impacts are felt in the tropical Pacific region, but it has far-reaching global consequences.\n\n\n\nOceanic and atmospheric effects\n\n\t\nThe PDO primarily influences sea surface temperatures and oceanic patterns in the North Pacific. It can have secondary effects on atmospheric circulation, precipitation patterns, and climate conditions in the surrounding regions.\n\t\nENSO can lead to significant shifts in atmospheric circulation, altering weather patterns, precipitation, and temperature anomalies across the Pacific basin and beyond.\n\n\n\nImpact\n\n\t\nThe PDO can influence weather patterns and climate conditions over extended periods, affecting fisheries, marine ecosystems, and even temperature and precipitation patterns in North America.\n\t\nENSO can have profound and immediate impacts on global weather and climate. El Ni\u00f1o is associated with warm oceanic conditions and can lead to droughts, flooding, and extreme weather events, while La Ni\u00f1a tends to have the opposite effects.\nConclusion\n\nPDO and ENSO are distinct climate phenomena, each with its timescale, geographic scope, and influence on oceanic and atmospheric conditions. Understanding these patterns is essential for climate forecasting and assessing their impacts on weather, agriculture, and ecosystems.\n\nScientists monitor the PDO to understand its phase and anticipate its impacts on regional climate and ecosystems. Understanding the PDO can be valuable for various sectors, including agriculture, fisheries, and water resource management, as it provides insights into long-term climate patterns in the North Pacific region.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

    "[CONTENT] #156": "The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is also known as Indian Nino or Indian Ocean\u2019s counterpart to El Ni\u00f1o. The IOD affects the climate of Australia and other countries that surround the Indian Ocean Basin and is a significant contributor to rainfall variability in this region. Read here to learn in-depth about the IOD.\n\nRecently, it has been reported that the climate models indicate a positive Indian Ocean dipole event during September-October-November.\n\nWhat does the above statement mean?

The IOD is often referred to as the \u201cIndian Ocean\u2019s counterpart to El Ni\u00f1o.\u201d\n\nThe IOD\u2019s influence on sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure can have far-reaching effects on regional weather patterns.\nPositive IOD events can lead to droughts in countries like India, which rely heavily on the monsoon rains, as well as reduced agricultural productivity in affected areas.\nConversely, negative IOD events can bring relief from drought conditions in some regions but can also lead to an increased risk of flooding.\n\nRead:\u00a0Impact of climate change on Indian monsoon\n\nVariability and Prediction\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole exhibits variability on various timescales, from intra-seasonal to interannual.\nPredicting the IOD is challenging, but advances in climate modeling and monitoring have improved the ability to forecast its development.\nThe IOD is influenced by multiple factors, including ocean-atmosphere interactions and interactions with other climate phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o.\nPast events\n\nThe positive IOD event is known to help the South-West monsoon. The 2019 event was one of the strongest on record.\n\nIt drove the Indian monsoon to excess and extended it into October.\nFor Australia, a positive IOD event year brought low rainfall from October to December, a late monsoon onset, and low tropical cyclone activity.\nIndian Ocean Dipole and ENSO\n\nIndian Ocean Dipole is a varying ocean-atmosphere system in the Indian Ocean like ENSO in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nENSO and IOD are not directly linked but can influence each other indirectly. For example, during El Ni\u00f1o, the warming of the central and eastern Pacific can affect atmospheric circulation and rainfall patterns, which, in turn, can impact the IOD by affecting the trade winds and ocean currents in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThere are instances when a positive IOD and El Ni\u00f1o occur simultaneously, leading to compounded and potentially more extreme impacts on regional climate variability.\nIt was observed that a positive IOD index often negated the effect of ENSO, resulting in increased Monsoon rains in several ENSO years like 1983, 1994, and 1997.\nConclusion\n\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole is a vital climate driver that can significantly impact ecosystems, agriculture, water resources, and economies in the Indian Ocean region.\n\nIt underscores the complex interactions between ocean and atmosphere and the need for improved climate prediction systems to manage the potential impacts of its positive and negative phases.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ. With reference to \u2018Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)\u2019 sometimes mentioned in the news while forecasting the Indian monsoon, which of the following statements is/are correct? (2017)\n\nThe IOD phenomenon is characterized by a difference in sea surface temperature between the tropical Western Indian Ocean and the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean.\nAn IOD phenomenon can influence an El Nino\u2019s impact on the monsoon.\n\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below:\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 2 only\n\n(c) Both 1 and 2\n\n(d) Neither 1 nor 2\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

Here are some of the major rivers of the world, listed by continent.\n\nAfrica\nRIVER NILE\n\nConsidered to be the longest river in the world. The length of the Nile River is roughly 6650 kilometers. Lake Victoria is assumed to be the river\u2019s origin. The river\u2019s course passes through Egypt, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Burundi, Sudan, and South Sudan. The Blue and White Niles are the river\u2019s two tributaries.\n\nRIVER CONGO\n\nThe only river to cross the equator twice is the Congo River. It is originally known as the Zaire River. It has a length of\u00a0 4700\u00a0Km. It travels in a curving pattern across the continent of Africa. With some sections reaching depths of over 700 feet, it is also the deepest river in the entire globe.\n\nORANGE RIVER\n\nThe Orange River is the longest in South Africa. It starts in the Drakensberg in neighboring Lesotho, where it is also known as the Senqu River. It travels across South Africa before entering the Atlantic Ocean. The Orange River is a component of the border between Lesotho and South Africa as well as between Namibia and South Africa.\n\nFrom the river\u2019s source and the Atlantic Ocean, it travels 1,365 miles. The river was known as Gariep by the first residents, and Groote Rivier by the Dutch. Nonetheless, Colonel Robert Gordon gave it the name Orange River in 1779 in recognition of William V of Orange. Via the Orange River Project, the Orange River supports mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. The alluvial deposit on the river was where the first diamond in South Africa was found.\n\nLIMPOPO RIVER\n\nThe Limpopo River originates in southern Africa\u2019s central regions. It extends to a length of about 1,087 miles before flowing eastward toward the Indian Ocean. It has a 415,000-square-kilometre drainage basin.\u00a0 It is the Limpopo River that divides South Africa from Botswana and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe river starts at the confluence of its two tributaries, the Crocodile and Marico Rivers; its principal tributary in Botswana is the Notwane River. The Limpopo Basin is also home to numerous mining operations. Nonetheless, flooding has resulted in losses and damages.\n\nNIGER RIVER\n\nFlows through West Africa, passing through countries like Nigeria, Niger, Mali, and Guinea discharging through a massive delta, known as the Oil Rivers, into the Gulf of Guinea. The\u00a0Niger River\u00a0is the principal\u00a0river\u00a0of western\u00a0Africa, extending over 2,500 miles (about 4,180 km). The Niger is the third longest river in Africa, exceeded only by the Nile\u00a0and the\u00a0Congo Rivers\u00a0(also known as the Za\u00efre River). Its main tributary is the Benue River.\n\nZAMBEZI RIVER\n\nThe \u201cBig River\u201d sustains the lives of many iconic African species, including elephants, buffalo, hippos, antelope, and crocodiles, as well as the people who live between its modest source in the Zambian highlands and the Indian Ocean. It passes through parts of Angola, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.\n\nAs it moves eastward, the Zambezi gains momentum and supplies plenty of electricity to many of the communities in its basin. Zambia and Zimbabwe receive power from the Kariba Dam, while Mozambique and South Africa are lit up by the Cahora Bassa Dam. These two hydroelectric plants are among the biggest in Africa. Victoria Falls is undoubtedly Zambezi\u2019s most noteworthy feature.\n\nAsia\nGANGES RIVER\n\nBangladesh and India are traversed by the Ganges River. The river is 2510 kilometers long and a notable landmark, but it is better known for its profound religious importance.\n\nThe Ganges is regarded as the most revered body of water in the world in Hindu culture and religion. In mythology, the river represents the goddess Ganga, who was the offspring of the mountain deity Himalaya.\n\nBRAHMAPUTRA RIVER\n\nChina, India, and Bangladesh are all countries that the Brahmaputra River passes through over a distance of 2,391 miles (3,848 km). It runs towards the east through the Tibet Autonomous Region of China from its source in the mountains then into India. The stream drains into the Bay of Bengal from that location. It travels across Bangladesh and Assam during that time.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Transboundary rivers of India\n\nINDUS RIVER\n\nNext on the list is the Indus River, which flows across China, India, and Pakistan for a distance of 2,243 miles (3,610 km). It has twenty significant tributaries and is the largest and most important river in Pakistan. It originates in the Tibetan plateau, close to Lake Mansarovar and the Himalayas, flows through the Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir, and then across all of Pakistan before emptying into the Arabian Sea, a branch of the Indian Ocean.\n\nAlso Read: Indus Valley Civilization, Indus River and Tributaries, Major River systems in India\n\nYELLOW RIVER\n\nThis huge river, which has a length of\u00a0 5464 Km also known as the Huang He, is named after the color of its water. The color is caused by massive amounts of loose debris. Its basin is considered the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization. It has enormous symbolic and practical significance for the country.\n\nMEKONG RIVER\n\nIt stretches about 5,000 kilometers from its source on the Tibetan Plateau to the Mekong Delta. The longest river in Southeast Asia and the seventh longest in all of Asia is this transboundary river. The river, which is known by several names, flows through six Asian nations: China, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia.\n\n65 million people are living in the Mekong Basin, 80 percent of whom reside in the lower basin. With over 20,000 plants and 800 different species of fish, the river is likewise incredibly diverse.\n\nIRRAWADDY RIVER\n\nMyanmar is traversed by the Irrawaddy River, which runs from north to south. At a length of 1,348 miles, it is both the longest river in the nation and the most significant body of water for commerce. The Irrawaddy River rises at the meeting of the Rivers N\u2019mal and Mali. It travels southward before draining into the Andean Sea through the Irrawaddy Delta. A region of about 255,000 square kilometers is drained by the river.\n\nThe Irrawaddy River is home to a variety of creatures, including 43 different species of fish. The river provides water for rice irrigation and is a significant means of export and import transit. Notwithstanding the concern expressed by environmentalists, work is still being done along the river to build seven hydroelectric dams.\n\nSALWEEN RIVER\n\nA 1,491-mile-long river called the Salween originates in the Tibetan Plateau. It enters the Andaman Sea in Southeast Asia after passing through three nations. It drains a 320,000-square-kilometre watershed that is spread throughout China, Myanmar, and Thailand.\n\nAlmost 7 million people live along the Salween, one of the longest free-flowing rivers in the world, and are spread across 13 different ethnic groups. Moreover, the river is home to 25% of all animal species in the world, as well as 140 fish species and 7000 plant species. UNESCO rates the upper section of the river, which is in China, as the most biodiverse temperate ecosystem on Earth.\n\nYANGTZE RIVER\n\nThe Yangtze River is the third-longest river in the world and the longest river in the world to run entirely within one nation. It has a length of 6300 Km. Moreover, it is Asia\u2019s longest river. One-third of China\u2019s population is residing in the Yangtze River basin. The Chinese government has long believed that the river\u2019s source is the Tuotuo tributary in the Tanggula Mountains.\n\nRecently it is indicated that the headwaters of the Dam Qu tributary are located on Jari Hill, which is where the Yangtze River\u2019s source lies. The Yangtze River, which drains into the East China Sea at Shanghai, is formed when these and other tributaries come together.\n\nYENISEI RIVER\n\nThe Yenisei River originates in Mongolia and travels north before emptying into the Kara Sea in the Arctic Ocean via the Yenisei Gulf. Along the way, it drains a sizable portion of Siberia. The Yenisei begins in the Russian city of Kryzyl at the meeting of its headstreams, By-Khem (rising in the Eastern Sayan Mountains) and Ka-Khem (rising in Mongolia).\n\nIt then runs for 3,487 kilometers until finally draining into the Kara Sea. One of the main Yenisei headwater tributaries, the Angara River drains Lake Baikal. It enters the Yenisei near Strelka in Russia after leaving Lake Baikal.\n\nRIVER IRTYSH\n\nThe main tributary of the Ob River, the Irtysh River, has its origins in the glaciers of the Altai mountains in the Chinese region of Xinjiang, which is close to Mongolia. It eventually meets the Ob near Khanty-Mansiysk, western Siberia, Russia, and flows northwest into Kazakhstan before emptying into the Arctic Ocean.\n\nThe river\u2019s whole course spans around 4,248 km. Along with its banks, there are several significant cities in China, Kazakhstan, and Russia. The river is a crucial conduit for the movement of people and goods throughout the nations through which it flows.\n\nURAL\u00a0 RIVER\n\nThe Ural River is a 2,428 km long river that flows through Russia and Kazakhstan along the continental divide between Europe and Asia. It is also known as the Zhayyq River in the local Kazakh language. The Caspian Sea, the most enormous inland sea in the world and located between Europe and Asia, is where the river drains after its source in Russia\u2019s Ural Mountains near Mount Kruglaya.\n\nThe digitate delta, or tree-like structure, of the Ural River, which is visible as it enters the Caspian Sea, is a notable characteristic of the river. The words \u201cEurope\u201d and \u201cAsia\u201d are engraved into permanent monuments that are placed on either side of the Ural River bridge in Orenburg, Russia.\n\nLENA RIVER\n\nThe Lena River spans the entirety of Russia\u2019s boundaries and is 2,668 kilometers long. It can be found in the north, where there is a wealth of wildlife and natural resources, including gold. The river originates in the Baikal range, just to the east of the actual Baikal Lake, and travels primarily through the Russian Republic of Sakha before finally joining the Yenisei River and making a vast arc up to the Laptev Sea, which is a part of the Arctic Ocean, where it empties.\n\nRIVER AMUR\n\nThe Heilong Jiang, commonly known as the Amur River, is the tenth-longest river in the world. It forms the border between northeastern China and Russia. It has a length of\u00a0 4480 \u00a0Km. The word Amur is thought to have originated from a term meaning \u201cwater\u201d. The Chinese word Heilong Jiang translates to \u201cblack dragon river.\u201d\n\nOB-IRTYSH\n\nThe Ob-Irtysh also referred to as the Ob River, is one of the three major Siberian rivers, together with the Yenisei and the Lena. It starts in the Altas Mountains and empties into the Arctic Ocean. It has a length of\u00a0 5410 \u00a0Km.\n\nRIVER EUPHRATES\n\nThe Euphrates River, which spans over 2,800 km, is regarded as Western Asia\u2019s longest river. The river rises in the Armenian Highlands in southeast Turkey. It flows through Syria and Iraq to meet the Tigris River and eventually empties into the Persian Gulf.\n\nRIVER TIGRIS\n\nIt was one of the primary water sources that helped Mesopotamia and other ancient cultures develop. The Tigris River, which flows 1,750 km from its source in the Armenian Highlands to its mouth in the Persian Gulf, is Western Asia\u2019s second-largest river after the Euphrates River.\n\nThe Tigris River drains an area of around 375,000 square kilometers and passes through Turkey, Syria, and Iraq (including Iran). Nearly the whole length, the Tigris River and Euphrates River are parallel.\n\nEurope\nDANUBE RIVER\n\nIt is one of the s most important shipping lanes in Europe. It plays a key factor in the settlement patterns and political development of Central and South-Eastern Europe. It originates at the meeting of the Brigach and Breg rivers, close to the German town of Donaueschingen, in the Black Forest region of Germany.\n\nIt flows for 2,850 kilometers. Germany, Austria, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Moldova, Ukraine, and Romania are among the ten European countries that the river flows through. Ultimately, the Danube River empties into the Black Sea through the Danube Delta.\n\nIt is referred to as Donau in Germany and Austria; known as Dunaj in Slovakia and Ukraine, Dun\u0103rea in Romania, Dunav in Croatia, Serbia, and Bulgaria, and Duna in Hungary. Many cultural artifacts, including Greek myths, Romanian melodies, and even contemporary novels, memorialize its importance.\n\nRIVER ODER\n\nThe Oder River is the second-longest river in Poland, measuring roughly 840 km. Its source is in the rocky highlands of the eastern Czech Republic. It runs through Poland\u2019s western region before forming a boundary with Germany. The Peene, Wina, and Dziwna branches all drain into the Baltic Sea, while the river\u2019s main branch empties into the Szczecin Lagoon.\n\nDNIEPER RIVER\n\nThe Dnieper River is the fourth-longest in Europe with a length of around 2,200 km. It comes from the Valdai Hills, which are close to the city of Smolensk in Russia. More than 32,000 tributaries of the Dnieper River are thought to exist. Berezina, Bilozerka, Drut, Desna, Prypiat, Sozh, Myareya, Samara, Sula, and Vyazma are a few of its tributaries.\n\nRIVER VOLGA\n\nThe Volga River is the main river in western Russia. It extends 3,530 kilometers from its source in the Valdai Hills to the Caspian Sea, the biggest inland body of water in the world. It encompasses a significant portion of the Volga area. A little more than half of Russia\u2019s population resides in the Volga River Basin.\n\nFour of the ten largest cities in Russia are located along the river\u2019s full course. One of the greatest rivers in the world due to its historical, cultural, and economic significance. In the past, the Eurasian Civilization came together near the Volga River. It also has some of the biggest reservoirs in the world and provides a significant portion of the direct and indirect livelihood for millions of people.\n\nELBE RIVER\n\nThe Elbe River is 1,112 kilometers long. It has its beginnings in the southern Krkonose Mountains, which are close to the border between Poland and the Czech Republic. Following Bohemia in the northwest of the Czech Republic, it runs past Germany\u2019s eastern border and into the North Sea close to the town of Cuxhaven. Saale, Mulde, Ohre, Vltava, Schwarze Elster, Havel, and Alster are a few of the important Elbe River tributaries.\n\nRIVER RHINE\n\nWith a length of almost 1,230 kilometers from its source in Switzerland to its mouth on the North Sea in the Netherlands, the Rhine River is the eleventh-longest in Europe. This transboundary river travels through six nations\u2014Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, Germany, and the Netherlands. It drains an area of around 185,000 square kilometers.\n\nThe Rhine Basin also drains sections of France, Italy, and Belgium. One of Europe\u2019s most significant rivers in terms of history, culture, and economy is the Rhine. Over 20% of the world\u2019s chemical industry is manufactured near the river, which helps industrial transportation and output. The Rhine and the Danube together formed the northern inland border of the Roman Empire.\n\nRHONE RIVER\n\nThe Rhone River begins in the Rhone glacier of the Swiss mountains. It has a length of around 813 kilometers. This swiftly moving river enters Lake Geneva at its eastern end before running through the southeast of France on its way south. The Rhone River splits into the Big Rhone and Little Rhone near the French city of Arles before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nTHAMES RIVER\n\nThe River Thames is a 346 km river that originates at Thames\u2019s head in the Cotswold Hills in the county of Gloucestershire. It flows across southern England. After the River Severn, it is the second-longest river in the United Kingdom and the longest in England. The river runs into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary after passing through several well-known cities, including London, Reading, Hendley-on-Thomas, Windsor, and Oxford, where it is also known as the Isis River.\n\nDON RIVER\n\nThe Don River is the fifth-longest in Europe with a length of roughly 1,870 kilometres. Then, when it approaches the Volga River, it runs in a southeasterly direction until abruptly turning west to enter the Gulf of Taganrog in the Sea of Azov. Chir, Seversky Donets, Chyornaya Kalitva, Krasivaya Mecha, Khopyor, and Medveditsa are a few of the Don River\u2019s tributaries. The Don River and the Volga River are connected by the Lenin Volga-Don Shipping Canal.\n\nNorth America\nRIVER MISSISSIPPI\n\nThe Mississippi, Missouri, and Jefferson rivers combine to form the world\u2019s fourth-longest river system. It has a length of\u00a0 6275 Km. The river system drains 31 US states as well as two Canadian provinces.\n\nThe Mississippi River runs into the Gulf of Mexico from northern Minnesota. Lake Itasca is regarded to be its source. We get the Mississippi-Missouri-Jefferson River system when we regard the Jefferson River as the Mississippi River\u2019s farthest source.\n\nAlso Read: Major Landforms \u2013 Mountains, Plateaus, and Plains: Learn faster \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nSAINT LAWRENCE RIVER\n\nIts discharge originates in Lake Ontario and empties into the Atlantic Ocean near the Southeast coast of Canada\u2019s main continent. The St. Lawrence Seaway, which stretches for approximately 4,000 kilometers (or 2,500 miles), includes the river, which is 1,197 kilometers (744 miles) long. The river was once a basin filled with glaciers that grew larger as the ice flowed away.\n\nMACKENZIE RIVER\n\nThe Mackenzie River system is found in North America. It is also the biggest and longest river basin in Canada. From its headwaters in the Finlay River to its drainage into the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean, the Mackenzie River system travels 4,241 kilometers. Together, the Mackenzie and its tributaries drain a region that makes up nearly 20% of all of Canada\u2019s land.\n\nMany of the Mackenzie River\u2019s tributaries extend into neighboring Canadian provinces including British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Yukon, even though the Mackenzie River itself fully runs within the Northwest Territories of Canada. The Peace, Athabasca, and Liard Rivers are a few of the Mackenzie River\u2019s most significant tributaries. The Lake Athabasca, Great Slave, and Great Bear Lakes are only a few of the lakes that are significant components of the Mackenzie River system.\n\nMISSOURI RIVER\n\nA major tributary of the Mississippi River in the United States.\n\nCOLORADO RIVER\n\nFlows through the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, known for the Grand Canyon.\n\nSouth America\nAMAZON RIVER\n\nIn terms of total water flow volume, the Amazon River is without a doubt the largest in the world. It has a length of 6575\u00a0 Km. Its claims to be the second-longest river in the world, however, is widely contested because Egypt\u2019s Nile River has long held the title. The debate on the origins of the Amazon is the source of the dispute. The Cordillera Rumi Cruz is where the Amazon started, claims a 2014 study.\n\nPARANA RIVER\n\nOne of the world\u2019s longest rivers with a length of 4880 Km. The Parana River is found in South America. The Tupi word para the on\u00e1va, which means \u201clike the sea,\u201d is the source of its name.\n\nORINOCO RIVER\n\nIn South America, the Orinoco River passes through Colombia and Venezuela. In terms of the volume of discharge, it is ranked as the fourth-largest river in the world. Its 1,330-mile length makes it one of South America\u2019s longest rivers.\n\nMADEIRA RIVER\n\nOne of the principal rivers of South America, the 2,100-mile-long Madeira River flows between Bolivia and Brazil. It is one of the largest and most important tributaries of the Amazon River. The Portuguese referred to it as \u201cMadeira,\u201d which translates to \u201cWood River,\u201d but its previous name was the Cuyari River.\n\nThe Madeira is created by the confluence of the Mamore and Madre de Dios rivers. This river overflows during the rainy season, rising to a height of 50 feet and submerging the forests on its sides. From arider to more humid, its climate varies as it moves from region to region. After entering the lower plains, the Madeira River empties into the Abuna River.\n\nAustralia\nMURRAY RIVER\n\nAustralia\u2019s longest river, the Murray, flows through the southeast of the nation. It travels through New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia and is 2508 kilometers long. Almost 1.5 million homes in Australia receive their water from this river, which is also used to irrigate nearby fields.\n\nDARLING RIVER\n\nA major tributary of the Murray-Darling system.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe culture of most places of the world is heavily influenced by the larger rivers that they depend on for food and transportation. The majority of the riverside towns and villages have a robust boat industry and travel hundreds of kilometers for fishing and cargo transportation.\n\nSome communities regard certain portions of these rivers as sacred, and only specific methods may be used to access these areas. Fish, reptiles, and huge mammals are just a few of the diverse plants and animals that may be found in the world\u2019s rivers.\n\nThe melting of glaciers will likely be accelerated by climate change and the resulting temperature rises, which will initially increase water levels but ultimately result in decreased river discharge.\n\nThe water quality in many major rivers of the world has already deteriorated to dangerous levels as a result of heavy home, industrial, and agricultural waste pollution. Rapid economic growth and urbanization have contributed to some of this, thus pollution is expected to persist unabatedly.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Read the article to get an in-depth understanding.\n\nAlthough India has a monsoon climate, regional variations exist due to different weather elements. These variations create subtypes of the monsoon climate, forming the basis for identifying climatic regions.\n\nEach climatic region has a homogeneous climatic condition resulting from a combination of factors, with temperature and rainfall being decisive factors in all classification schemes. The classification of climate is a complex exercise, with various methods available.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStamp\u2019s Classification of Climatic Regions\nStamp\u2019s Classification of the Climatic Regions of India\n(A) Temperate India\n(B) Tropical India\nK\u00f6ppen Classification of Climatic Regions\nGroup A: Tropical Humid Climates\nGroup B: Dry Climates\nGroup C: Warm Temperate (Mid-Latitude) Climates\nGroup D: Continental Climates\nGroup E: Polar Climates\nGroup H: Highland Climates\nK\u00f6ppen Classification of Climatic Regions of India\nConclusion\nStamp\u2019s Classification of Climatic Regions\n\nThe Dudley Stamp climate classification is an alternative climate classification system developed by British geographer and climatologist, Laurence Dudley Stamp.\n\nThis classification system is designed to emphasize the climatic factors most relevant to human settlement and land use. It differs from other climate classification systems, such as the K\u00f6ppen classification, by focusing more on the practical implications of climate for human activities.\n\nThe Dudley Stamp climate classification system includes five main climate groups, which are further divided into subtypes:\n\nArid Climates (A):\n\nA1: Hot desert climate with high evaporation rates (similar to BWh in K\u00f6ppen).\nA2: Cool desert climate with lower evaporation rates (similar to BWk in K\u00f6ppen).\n\nTemperate Climates (B):\n\nB1: Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (similar to Csa in K\u00f6ppen).\nB2: Warm-summer continental climate (similar to Dfa, Dfb in K\u00f6ppen).\nB3: Cool-summer continental climate (similar to Dfc, Dfd in K\u00f6ppen).\n\nSnow Climates (C):\n\nC1: Maritime snow climate (similar to Cfb, Cfc in K\u00f6ppen).\nC2: Continental snow climate (similar to Dfb, Dfc, and Dfd in K\u00f6ppen).\n\nPolar Climates (D):\n\nD1: Tundra climate (similar to ET in K\u00f6ppen).\nD2: Ice cap climate (similar to EF in K\u00f6ppen).\n\nHumid Climates (E):\n\nE1: Hot humid climate (similar to Af in K\u00f6ppen).\nE2: Warm humid climate (similar to Am, Aw in K\u00f6ppen).\nE3: Cool humid climate (similar to Cfa, Cwa in K\u00f6ppen).\nStamp\u2019s Classification of the Climatic Regions of India\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nL. Dudley Stamp and Kendrew shared similar views on the classification of India\u2019s climate.\n\nThey divided the country into two primary regions, based on the Tropic of Cancer.\nThis line roughly follows the 18\u00b0C isotherm of mean monthly temperature in January.\nThe northern part of this line is referred to as Temperate India, while the southern part is known as Tropical India.\nBoth of these central climatic regions are further divided into eleven sub-regions based on the amount of rainfall and temperature.\n\nWhile this classification is considered rational and reasonable, it is also subjective to a certain degree.\n\n(A) Temperate India\n\nThis region is alternatively known as continental India, where the temperature in January does not exceed 18\u00b0C. It is further divided into five sub-regions based on the amount of rainfall and the physical characteristics of the area.\n\nHimalayan Region\nNorth-West Region\nDry Desert Region\nModerate Rainfall Region\nThe Transitional Region\n(B) Tropical India\n\nThis region is located south of the Tropic of Cancer, where the temperature in January exceeds 18\u00b0C. The isotherm line for this region does not strictly follow the Tropic of Cancer line. It is divided into six sub-divisions based on various factors.\n\nVery Heavy Rainfall Region\nHeavy Rainfall Region\nModerate Rainfall Region\nThe Konkan Coast Region\nThe Malabar Coast Region\nThe Coastal Region of Tamilnadu\nK\u00f6ppen Classification of Climatic Regions\n\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification is a widely used system for classifying the world\u2019s climates. It was developed by Wladimir K\u00f6ppen, a German botanist and climatologist, in 1884, and has been revised several times since then.\n\nThe K\u00f6ppen classification system uses average monthly temperature and precipitation data to classify climates into five primary types, four of them are based on temperature and one on precipitation: tropical, dry, temperate, continental, and polar.\nThese primary types are further divided into subtypes, and the resulting classification is based on a combination of letters and numbers that represent the different climate types and subtypes.\n\nIn the table below, the capital letters: A, C, D, and E delineate humid climates and B dry climates.\n\nThe different climatic groups are further classified into various types, denoted by small letters, based on the seasonal patterns of precipitation and temperature characteristics.\n\nThe dry seasons are indicated by the letters f, m, w, and s, where f indicates no dry season, m refers to a monsoon climate, w denotes a winter dry season, and s signifies a summer dry season.\nThe small letters a, b, c, and d are used to indicate the degree of temperature severity. In the B-Dry Climates, the subdivisions are denoted by the capital letters S for steppe or semi-arid and W for deserts, based on the level of aridity.\nGroup A: Tropical Humid Climates\n\nTropical humid climates exist between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The annual range of temperature is deficient and annual rainfall is high. The tropical group is divided into three types, namely:\n\nAf: Tropical Rainforest Climate \u2013 High precipitation throughout the year.\nAm: Tropical Monsoon Climate \u2013 High precipitation in the summer season.\nAw: Tropical Savanna Climate \u2013 Distinct wet and dry seasons.\nGroup B: Dry Climates\n\nDry climates are characterized by minimal rainfall that is insufficient to support the growth of plants.\n\nThese climates are widespread and cover vast latitudes between 15\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 north and south of the equator.\nThey are classified into two main types: steppe or semi-arid climate (BS) and desert climate (BW).\n\nThese classifications are further subdivided based on latitude. The subtropical regions falling between latitudes of 15\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 are classified as subtropical steppe (BSh) and subtropical desert (BWh). On the other hand, the mid-latitude regions between 35\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 are classified as mid-latitude steppe (BSk) and mid-latitude desert (BWk).\n\nBWh: Hot Desert Climate \u2013 Hot temperatures and very low rainfall.\nBWk: Cold Desert Climate \u2013 Cold winters with low rainfall.\nBSh: Hot Steppe Climate \u2013 Hot temperatures with limited rainfall.\nBSk: Cold Steppe Climate \u2013 Cold winters with limited rainfall.\nGroup C: Warm Temperate (Mid-Latitude) Climates\n\nWarm temperate (mid-latitude) climates extend from 30\u00b0 \u2013 50\u00b0 of latitude mainly on the eastern and western margins of continents. These climates generally have warm summers with mild winters. They are grouped into five subtypes:\n\nCfa: Humid Subtropical Climate \u2013 Hot summers and mild winters with rainfall throughout the year.\nCwa: Monsoon-influenced Humid Subtropical Climate \u2013 Hot summers with rainy and dry seasons.\nCfb: Marine West Coast Climate \u2013 Mild temperatures with moderate rainfall throughout the year.\nCfc: Subpolar Oceanic Climate \u2013 Cold temperatures with moderate rainfall throughout the year.\nCsa: Mediterranean Climate \u2013 Hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.\nGroup D: Continental Climates\n\nThese climates experience distinct seasons, with cold winters and warm to hot summers. They are further divided into four subtypes:\n\nDfa: Hot Summer Continental Climate \u2013 Hot summers and cold winters.\nDfb: Warm Summer Continental Climate \u2013 Warm summers and cold winters.\nDfc: Subarctic Climate \u2013 Cold winters and cool summers.\nDfd: Extremely Cold Subarctic Climate \u2013 Very cold winters and cool summers.\nGroup E: Polar Climates\n\nPolar climates exist poleward beyond 70\u00b0 latitude. Polar climates consist of two types:\n\nET: Tundra Climate \u2013 Cold temperatures with short, cool summers.\nEF: Ice Cap Climate \u2013 Extremely cold temperatures with little to no vegetation.\nGroup H: Highland Climates\n\nThe climate in highland areas is primarily influenced by the topography of the region. In mountainous terrain, even small distances can result in significant fluctuations in mean temperature.\n\nPrecipitation types and intensity also vary across highlands in space. Additionally, there is a vertical zonation of climatic types as we move up in altitude, resulting in distinct layers of climatic conditions in the mountainous environment.\n\nK\u00f6ppen Classification of Climatic Regions of India\n\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification system categorizes India\u2019s diverse climate zones into several different types based on temperature, precipitation, and other climatic characteristics.\n\nIndia experiences a wide range of climate types due to its vast geographical extent and varying topography. Here are the main K\u00f6ppen climate types found in different regions of India:\n\nTropical Monsoon Climate (Am):\n\nCharacteristics: This climate is characterized by high temperatures and a distinct wet season (monsoon) with heavy rainfall. Summers are hot, and winters are relatively dry.\nDistribution: Most of India, including the western coastal areas, the northern plains, and the northeastern states, experiences a tropical monsoon climate. Cities like Mumbai, Kolkata, and Delhi fall under this category.\n\nTropical Savanna Climate (Aw):\n\nCharacteristics: This climate has distinct wet and dry seasons. Summers are hot and wet, while winters are dry and cooler.\nDistribution: Regions of India that experience the tropical savanna climate include parts of central and peninsular India, such as Hyderabad and Chennai.\n\nSubtropical Humid Climate (Cfa, Cwa):\n\nCharacteristics: Summers are hot, and winters are mild. Rainfall is well-distributed throughout the year. Cfa has a warm summer, while Cwa has a monsoon-influenced summer.\nDistribution: Cities like Delhi, Lucknow, and Kolkata fall under the subtropical humid climate.\n\nDesert Climate (BWh, BWk):\n\nCharacteristics: Hot temperatures and very low rainfall. BWk has cold winters.\nDistribution: The Thar Desert in northwestern India, including regions of Rajasthan, experiences a desert climate.\n\nMountain Climate (Cwb, Cwc, Dsb, Dsc, ET, EF):\n\nCharacteristics: These climates are found in high-altitude regions. Summers are cool, and winters are cold. Cwb and Cwc have more precipitation than Dsb and Dsc. ET represents a tundra climate, and EF represents an ice cap climate.\nDistribution: Himalayan regions of northern India, including places like Shimla, experience mountain climates.\n\nSemi-Arid and Arid Climates (BSh, BSk):\n\nCharacteristics: Hot temperatures with limited rainfall. BSh has a hot steppe climate, while BSk has a cold steppe climate.\nDistribution: Parts of northwestern and central India, including cities like Jaipur, experience semi-arid and arid climates.\n\nTropical Rainforest Climate (Af):\n\nCharacteristics: High temperatures and heavy rainfall throughout the year.\nDistribution: The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, as well as some parts of northeastern India, experience the tropical rainforest climate.\n\nMediterranean Climate (Csa):\n\nCharacteristics: Hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.\nDistribution: A small region along the western coast of India, including parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka, experiences a Mediterranean climate.\nConclusion\n\nThe Dudley Stamp climate classification system places greater emphasis on the human aspects of climate and its impact on agriculture, settlement, and other human activities. It\u2019s particularly useful for geographers and planners interested in understanding how climate affects the practical aspects of life in different regions.\n\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification system provides a way to understand and categorize the world\u2019s diverse climates based on shared characteristics. It has been widely adopted by scientists, geographers, and climatologists for research and communication purposes.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the K\u00f6ppen climate classification remains more widely recognized and used internationally for its comprehensive categorization of global climate patterns. The Dudley Stamp classification is more specialized and may be of particular interest to researchers and professionals studying the human-environment interaction in specific regions.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

But what do they mean, what are events related to them, and how do they influence the seasons on Earth- these are some of the in-depth questions that will be answered here. Read further to learn more.\n\nEquinoxes and solstices are radically opposing. Equinoxes and solstices are what give rise to the earth\u2019s seasons.\n\nOn account of the planet\u2019s inclination towards its axis,\u00a0as it circles the Sun, seasons fluctuate on Earth. This implies that various regions of the Earth receive more or less sunlight depending on the time of year.\n\nThe Sun would constantly appear above the Equator, the amount of light received at any given position would be constant, and there wouldn\u2019t be any seasons if the Earth weren\u2019t tilted. The equinoxes and solstices wouldn\u2019t even need to be observed.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSolstice\nScience of Solstices\nEquinox\nScience of Equinoxes\nSolstice and Equinox: Relation to seasons\nSolstice and Equinox: Cultural significance\nSolstice\n\nA solstice is an event in which a planet\u2019s poles are most extremely inclined toward or away from the star it orbits.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSolar declination, the latitude of Earth where the sun is directly above at noon defines solstices on our planet.\n\nThe solar declination reaches the Tropic of Cancer in the north and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south at the solstices, which occur twice a year on Earth.\nThe solar declination of the June solstice, which is observed between June 20 and June 22, is around 23.5\u00b0N (the Tropic of Cancer).\nSolar declination is around 23.5\u00b0S (the Tropic of Capricorn) during the December solstice, which is observed between December 20 and December 23.\n\nSolar declination describes the latitude of Earth where the sun is directly overhead at noon.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s 23.5\u00b0 axial tilt as it circles the sun causes solitons and varying solar declinations.\n\nThis indicates that, depending on which hemisphere is inclined towards the sun during the year, it gets the sun\u2019s rays at their strongest intensity.\n\nDespite having distinct dates in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the solstices are referred to as the \u201csummer solstice\u201d and the \u201cwinter solstice,\u201d respectively.\n\nThe longest day of the year is the summer solstice when the sun is at its strongest and there are the most hours of daylight.\nThe winter solstice has the fewest daylight hours and is the shortest day of the year.\nThe June solstice is the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe December solstice is the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and the summer solstice in the Southern.\n\nSolstices occur on every planet in our solar system. The planet\u2019s axial tilt, orbital eccentricity, and distance from the sun all have a significant role in determining the date and size of solstices.\n\nThe axial tilt of Venus, the planet nearest to Earth, is barely 3\u00b0. Its solstices are spaced by around three months; thus, Venus suffers relatively little seasonal fluctuation.\nOur other close neighbor, Mars, has a 24\u00b0 axial tilt, which is identical to Earth\u2019s. Mars, on the other hand, orbits the sun in an orbit that is noticeably more elliptical than Earth\u2019s because of its substantially higher orbital eccentricity. Mars has dramatic seasonal fluctuations and its solstices are spaced around 11 months apart due to its greater orbital eccentricity and axial tilt.\nScience of Solstices\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nThe solstices are felt differently depending on the latitude of Earth. The solstice marks the maximum point of dramatic exposure to daylight at the poles while scarcely being recognized near the equator.\n\nEquatorial regions\n\nThe Equator, at 0\u00b0 latitude, receives a maximum intensity of the sun\u2019s rays all year.\nAs a result, areas near Earth\u2019s Equator experience relatively constant sunlight and little solstice variation.\n\nMidlatitudes\n\nEarth\u2019s solstices are largely marked by the transition of the subsolar point across the tropics.\n\nThe latitude where the sun\u2019s rays strike Earth perfectly perpendicular to its surface is known as the subsolar point. It is the location where the sun is above at midday.\nThe subsolar point travels north and south over the tropics for the majority of the year before appearing at the Equator twice a year (around the equinoxes).\nThe subsolar point travels to its northern and southernmost latitudes at the solstices.\nOn the June solstice, the Tropic of Cancer, which is 23.5\u00b0 north of the equator, receives direct sunlight.\nThe subsolar point then starts moving south, and on the December solstice, vertical rays fall on the Tropic of Capricorn, which is 23.5\u00b0 south of the equator.\nEvery latitude in between these two extremes will be traversed by the subsolar point twice annually.\n\nPolar regions\n\nThe Arctic and Antarctica are never reached by the subsolar point.\n\nThe solstices represent the times when the sun is highest or lowest in the sky at the North and South Poles, respectively.\nTherefore, the solstices serve as the most extreme manifestations of the \u201cmidnight sun\u201d and \u201cpolar night.\u201d\nThe phenomena around the summer solstice, when the sun is still visible at midnight in the weeks preceding and after the event, is referred to as the \u201cmidnight sun.\u201d\nThe weeks preceding and after the winter solstice are referred to as the \u201cpolar night\u201d since the sun is below the horizon.\nEquinox\n\nAn equinox is an event in which a planet\u2019s subsolar point passes through its Equator.\n\nThe equinoxes are the only time when both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres experience roughly equal amounts of daytime and nighttime.\n\nTwo equinoxes occur annually on Earth: one around March 21 and the other around September 22. Even though the spring and fall equinoxes have distinct dates in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\n\nThe equinoxes are occasionally referred to as the \u201cvernal equinox\u201d (spring equinox) and the \u201cautumnal equinox\u201d (fall equinox).\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the March equinox marks the spring equinox, whereas, in the Southern Hemisphere, it marks the autumnal equinox.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the equinox in September is the autumnal equinox; in the Southern, it is the vernal equinox.\n\nOn most planets, equinoxes occur. The axial tilt and orbital properties of the planet dictate when the equinoxes occur.\n\nEquinoxes are very spectacular on the gas giant Saturn. The equinoxes on Saturn occur every 15 years and last for around four days.\nThe magnificent ring system of Saturn revolves in the same plane as the equator of the planet.\nThe rings span thousands of kilometers across, yet they are just a few kilometers broad, making them exceedingly thin.\nThe rings and Saturn\u2019s equator exactly align with the sun during Saturn\u2019s equinoxes. Images taken from the perspective of the sun show the rings as a fine line.\nScience of Equinoxes\n\nDuring the equinoxes, solar declination is 0\u00b0. So, equinoxes are the only times of the year when the subsolar point is directly on the Equator.\n\nThe apparent center of the Sun\u2019s disc is in the same plane as the Equator during an equinox, which prevents Earth\u2019s 23.5\u00b0 axis from tilting either towards or away from the Sun.\n\nThe subsolar point moves north or south both before and after the equinox.\n\nThe subsolar point moves northward after the March equinox when the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the sun.\nThe subsolar point crosses the Tropic of Cancer (23.5\u00b0N) around June 21.\nThe subsolar point starts to move southward after this June solstice.\nThe subsolar point keeps moving south after the September equinox as the Southern Hemisphere tilts towards the sun.\nThe subsolar point crosses the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5\u00b0S) around December 21 which is the December solstice.\n\nThe sun terminator equally divides the Earth from north to south at an equinox, indicating equally lighted hemispheres.\n\nOn a globe, the darkened line denoting day and night is known as the solar terminator.\nThere would be 12 hours of day and night on an actual equinox.\n\nEquatorial regions\n\nThe sun\u2019s rays are at their strongest all year round in the Equator, which is located at 0\u00b0 latitude.\nAs a result, there is little equinoctial oscillation and generally consistent sunshine in regions close to the equator.\nIn general, equinoxes and celestial seasons have less of an effect than climate-driven patterns like precipitation (rainy seasons and dry seasons).\n\nMidlatitudes\n\nWith latitude, seasonal fluctuation gets more extreme. The difference between the lengths of day and night during the \u201cequinox\u201d is significantly widened by atmospheric refraction.\nThe day lasts roughly eight minutes longer than the night at a latitude of around 30\u00b0.\n\nPolar regions\n\nIn the Arctic and Antarctic, where atmospheric refraction is most pronounced, the length of the day is approximately 12 hours, 16 minutes.\nThe equinoxes in polar locations thus serve as a signal for the gradual transition from \u201cmidnight sun\u201d to \u201cpolar night.\u201d\nThe phenomenon known as the \u201cmidnight sun\u201d occurs when the sun never sets below the horizon, illuminating the area all day long.\nIn contrast, \u201cpolar night\u201d refers to a period when the sun never rises, putting the area in complete darkness for 24 hours.\nSolstice and Equinox: Relation to seasons\n\nWe all know that the Earth follows an elliptical orbit around the sun, doing a full rotation once every 365 days.\n\nThis implies that the average distance of 93 million miles between the Earth and the Sun fluctuates during the year.\nThe Earth travels around 1.6 million miles closer to the sun during the first week of January. The perihelion is used to describe this.\nThe first week of July marks the aphelion, or the moment at which the Earth is approximately 1.6 million miles further from the sun.\n\nAlthough this information may seem to contradict what we know about seasons in the Northern Hemisphere, the climatic difference is not that big and is NOT the cause of our seasons.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s 23.5\u00b0 tilt on its axis is what causes the seasons. The Northern Hemisphere has tilted away from the sun in December and towards the sun in June because the tilt\u2019s position about space remains constant throughout the year.\n\nThe solstices and equinoxes mark the beginning and end of each season on Earth.\n\nSolstice and Equinox: Cultural significance\n\nThe solstices currently signal the start of winter and summer, but in certain ancient societies, these were the only seasons acknowledged (autumn and spring were not there). As a result, the solstices took place in the middle of the seasons.\n\nDue to this, the solstices are sometimes referred to as midwinter and midsummer.\nNumerous civilizations have celebrated the solstices with celebrations and festivals since ancient times.\n\nLike the solstices, equinoxes are historic markers of seasonal change.\n\nThe March equinox is historically recognized as a time of rebirth and regeneration since it unofficially ushers in the spring season. Because of this, the March equinox has traditionally been observed by many civilizations as the start of a new year.\nThe majority of September equinox-related cultural celebrations are linked to harvest festivities in the fall.\n\nRead:\u00a0Leap year: How does it work?\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

Hence, under the rapidly depleting groundwater table, water harvesting is an ideal solution. Read here to learn more about rainwater harvesting.\n\nIndia possesses 4% of the world\u2019s water resources and makes up around 2.45% of its surface area.\n\nRainfall serves as India\u2019s main supply of freshwater. India receives the second-highest quantity of rainfall for a nation its size.\n\nThe average annual rainfall in India is 1,170 millimeters (46 in), or over 4,000 cubic kilometers (960 cubic miles) of water. This translates to about 1,720 cubic meters (61,000 cu feet) of freshwater per person.\n\nFor most places in India, groundwater is the main source of water supply, and the country\u2019s rapidly declining groundwater resources demand immediate attention if water security is to be ensured in the upcoming years.\n\nAlso read: Aravalli Green Wall Project\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRainwater harvesting\nTraditional water harvesting systems in India\nGovernment policies for Rainwater harvesting\nWay forward\nRainwater harvesting\n\nThe act of collecting and storing rainwater as opposed to letting it flow off is known as rainwater harvesting.\n\nRainwater is gathered from a surface like a roof and directed to a container with percolation, such as a tank, cistern, deep pit (well, shaft, or borehole), aquifer, or reservoir where it seeps down and replenishes the groundwater table.\n\nThe rainwater harvesting process includes the collection and storage of collected rainwater with the help of artificially designed systems.\n\nThe main components of the system are-\n\nCatchment: Used to collect and store the captured rainwater.\nConveyance system: It is used to transport the harvested water from the catchment to the recharge zone.\nFlush: It is used to flush out the first spell of rain.\nFilter: Used for filtering the collected rainwater and removing pollutants.\nTanks and recharge structures: Used to store the filtered water which is ready to use.\n\nRainwater harvesting has significance in solving other related issues in a nation like food security, rapid urbanization, and industrial developmental demands. This method acts as a decentralized source of water for all needs.\n\nTraditional water harvesting systems in India\n\nWater has been harvested in India since antiquity, with our ancestors perfecting the art of water management. The raindrops were harvested directly from rooftops collected water and stored in tanks built in their courtyards.\n\nFrom open community lands, the rain was collected and stored in artificial wells.\nThe monsoon runoff was harvested by capturing water from swollen streams during the monsoon season and storing it through various forms of water bodies.\nThe water was also harvested from flooded rivers.\n\nPaar system: Paar is a common water harvesting practice in the western Rajasthan region.\n\nIt is a common place where the rainwater flows from the agar (catchment) and in the process percolates into the sandy soil.\nTo access the Rajani pani (percolated water) kuis or beris are dug in the agor (storage area).\n\nTalan/bandhis: Talabs are reservoirs.\n\nThey may be natural, such as the ponds (pokhariyan) at Tikamgarh in the Bundelkhand region.\nThey can be human-made, such as the lakes in Udaipur.\nA reservoir area of fewer than five bighas is called a talai; a medium-sized lake is called a bandhi or talab; bigger lakes are called sagar or samand.\nThe pokhariyan serves irrigation and drinking purposes. When the water in these reservoirs dries up just a few days after the monsoon, the pond beds are cultivated with rice.\n\nSaza kuva: An open well with multiple owners (saza means partner), saza kuva is the most important source of irrigation in the Aravalli hills in Mewar, eastern Rajasthan.\n\nThe soil dug out to make the well pit is used to construct a huge circular foundation or an elevated platform sloping away from the well.\nThe first is built to accommodate the rehat, a traditional water lifting device; the sloping platform is for the chada, in which buffaloes are used to lift water.\n\nJohads: Johads are small earthen check dams that capture and conserve rainwater, improving percolation and groundwater recharge.\n\nStarting in 1984, the last sixteen years have seen the revival of some 3000 johads spread across more than 650 villages in the Alwar district, Rajasthan.\nThis has resulted in a general rise of the groundwater level by almost 6 meters and a 33 percent increase in the forest cover in the area.\n\nPat: Bhitada village, Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh developed the unique pat system.\n\nThis system was devised according to the particularities of the terrain to divert water from swift-flowing hill streams into irrigation channels called pats.\n\nJhalaras: Jhalaras are typically rectangular-shaped step-wells that have tiered steps on three or four sides.\n\nThese step-wells collect the subterranean seepage of an upstream reservoir or a lake.\nJhalaras were built to ensure an easy and regular supply of water for religious rites, royal ceremonies, and community use.\nThe city of Jodhpur has eight jhalaras, the oldest being the Mahamandir Jhalara which dates back to 1660 CE.\n\nBawari: Bawaris are unique step-wells that were once a part of the ancient networks of water storage in the cities of Rajasthan.\n\nThe little rain that the region received would be diverted to man-made tanks through canals built on the hilly outskirts of cities.\nThe water would then percolate into the ground, raising the water table and recharging a deep and intricate network of aquifers.\nTo minimize water loss through evaporation, a series of layered steps were built around the reservoirs to narrow and deepen the wells.\n\nTaanka: Taanka is a traditional rainwater harvesting technique indigenous to the Thar desert region of Rajasthan.\n\nA Taanka is a cylindrical paved underground pit into which rainwater from rooftops, courtyards or artificially prepared catchments flows.\n\nAhar Pynes: Ahar Pynes are traditional floodwater harvesting systems native to South Bihar.\n\nAhars are reservoirs with embankments on three sides that are built at the end of diversion channels like pynes.\nPynes are artificial rivulets led off from rivers to collect water in the ahars for irrigation in the dry months.\nPaddy cultivation in this relatively low rainfall area depends mostly on ahar pynes.\n\nPanam keni: The Kuruma tribe (a native tribe of Wayanad) uses a special type of well, called the Panam keni, to store water.\n\nWooden cylinders are made by soaking the stems of toddy palms in water for a long time so that the core rots away until only the hard outer layer remains.\n\nKhadin: Khadins are ingenious constructions designed to harvest surface runoff water for agriculture.\n\nThe main feature of a khadin, also called dhora, is a long earthen embankment that is built across the hill slopes of gravelly uplands.\nSluices and spillways allow the excess water to drain off and the water-saturated land is then used for crop production.\nFirst designed by the Paliwal Brahmins of Jaisalmer in the 15th century, this system is very similar to the irrigation methods of the people of ancient Ur (present Iraq).\n\nKund: A kund is a saucer-shaped catchment area that gently slopes towards the central circular underground well. Its main purpose is to harvest rainwater for drinking.\n\nKunds dot the sandier tracts of western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Traditionally, these well-pits were covered in disinfectant lime and ash.\nRaja Sur Singh is said to have built the earliest known kunds in the village of Vadi Ka Melan in the year 1607 CE.\n\nBaoli: These were built by the nobility for civic, strategic, or philanthropic reasons, baolis were secular structures from which everyone could draw water.\n\nThese beautiful stepwells typically have beautiful arches, carved motifs, and sometimes, rooms on their sides.\nBaolis within villages were mainly used for utilitarian purposes and social gatherings.\nBaolis on trade routes were often frequented as resting places.\nStepwells used exclusively for agriculture had drainage systems that channeled water into the fields.\n\nNadi: These are village ponds that store rainwater collected from adjoining natural catchment areas. These are found near Jodhpur in Rajasthan.\n\nZings: These are found in Ladakh. They are small tanks that collect melting glacier water.\n\nA network of guiding channels brings water from the glacier to the tank. The melting waters of the glacier are article in the mornings and turn into a flowing stream by the afternoon.\nThe water, collected by evening, is used in the fields on the following day.\nA water official called a Chirpun is responsible for the equitable distribution of water in this dry region that relies on melting glacial water to meet its farming needs.\n\nKuhls: Kuhls are surface water channels found in the mountainous regions of Himachal Pradesh.\n\nThe channels carry glacial waters from rivers and streams into the fields.\nThe Kangra Valley system has an estimated 715 major Kuhls and 2,500 minor kuhls that irrigate more than 30,000 hectares in the valley.\nKulhs are an important cultural tradition and were built either through public donations or by royal rulers.\n\nZabo: It means \u2018impounding run-off\u201d. This system combines water conservation with forestry, agriculture, and animal care.\n\nPracticed in Nagaland, Zabo is also known as the Ruza system.\nRainwater that falls on forested hilltops is collected by channels that deposit the run-off water in pond-like structures created on the terraced hillsides.\n\nEri: It is a tank system used in Tamil Nadu which is one of the oldest water management systems in India.\n\nGovernment policies for Rainwater harvesting\n\nCentral Government has formulated National Water Policy 2012 which inter alia contains provisions for rainwater harvesting like:\n\nincentivizing the revival of traditional water harvesting structures by States,\nencouraging rainwater harvesting to increase the availability of utilizable water in urban and industrial areas,\npreference to urban and rural domestic water supply from surface water in conjunction with groundwater and rainwater, etc.\n\nWater being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation, and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments.\n\nSome of the major steps taken by the Government of India for rainwater harvesting are as follows:\n\nJal Shakti Abhiyan: This was expanded as \u201cJal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain\u201d (JSA: CTR) in 2021 with the theme \u201cCatch the Rain Where it Falls When it Falls\u201d to cover all the blocks of all districts (rural as well as urban areas) across the country.\n\nAtal Bhuj Yojana: It is a Central Sector Scheme with an outlay of Rs. 6,000 crores in identified water-stressed areas of 8,220 Gram Panchayats (GPs) under 229 blocks in 80 districts of 7 States viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh to arrest the decline in groundwater level through community-led sustainable groundwater management.\n\nWatershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) has got rainwater harvesting as one of the activities under its Natural Resource Management (NRM) component.\n\nSurface Minor Irrigation (SMI) and Repair, Renovation & Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies have multiple objectives expanding the cultivable area under assured irrigation by improvement and restoration of water bodies inter alia increasing groundwater recharge and revival of lost irrigation potential.\n\nMaster Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020 has been prepared by Central Ground Water Board in consultation with States/UTs which is a macro-level plan indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country.\n\nAtal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) was launched in 2015 and focuses on the development of basic urban infrastructure especially water supply & access to tap connection to every household in 500 cities.\n\nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) includes water conservation and water harvesting structures as one of the activities under its natural resource management (NRM) component.\n\nMission Amrit Sarovar was launched on National Panchayati Raj Day on 24th April 2022 as a part of the celebration of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav to conserve water for the future. The Mission is aimed at developing and rejuvenating 75 water bodies in each district of the country\n\nWay forward\n\nTo replenish India\u2019s depleting water supplies, it is urgent to encourage rainwater harvesting utilizing a combination of ancient rainfall-saving techniques including percolation tanks, injection wells, and subsurface barriers with modern rainwater-saving methods.\n\nBut relying just on conventional techniques is insufficient. The solution to India\u2019s ongoing water problems may be found in the effective combination of these techniques.\n\nIt is necessary to intensify efforts to lessen reliance on groundwater with a focus on improving water security.\n\nRejuvenation and replenishment of built-up and natural water bodies.\nincreased repurposing of cleaned wastewater by neighborhood sewage treatment facilities.\nAcross both residential and business locations, install properly constructed rainwater collection systems.\nGovernments at the federal and state levels must work together to enable these initiatives.\nFor long-term and sustainable solutions, strict policy actions are required.\nLocal government entities must propose and carry out an integrated water management strategy.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

As it descends, the snow accelerates, creating a river of snow and an ice cloud that rises far into the air.\n\nAs it rushes downward, the mass scoops up even more snow. The weight of a massive, fully-grown avalanche can reach one million tonnes.

It erupts from the starting zone.\n\nThat area of the stope is often the most unstable and is located higher up the mountain.\nThe avalanche follows its natural route downhill after it begins to slide, continuing along the avalanche track. Large clearings or tree chutes missing from an avalanche offer hints as to the route of the slide.\nThe runout zone, where snow and debris accumulate, is where the avalanche eventually comes to an end.\nTypes\n\nAvalanches come in a variety of forms, including-\n\nRock avalanches are made up of enormous chunks of broken rock. These are also known as landslides.\nIce avalanches frequently happen around a glacier.\nDebris avalanches contain a variety of unconsolidated materials, such as loose stones and soil.\n\nThere are two main types of snow avalanches- sluffs and slabs.\n\nSluff avalanches occur when the weak layer of a snowpack is on top. A sluff is a small slide of dry, powdery snow that moves as a formless mass. Sluffs are much less dangerous than slab avalanches.\nA slab avalanche occurs when the weak layer lies lower down in a snowpack. This layer is covered with other layers of compressed snow. When the avalanche is triggered, the weak layer breaks off, pulling all the layers on top of it down the slope. These layers tumble and fall in a giant block, or slab.\n\nAvalanches can be as small as a minor shifting of loose snow or as large as the displacement of massive slabs of snow.\n\nA slab avalanche\u2019s mass of descending snow may move at a pace of 130 km/h (80 mph), capable of obliterating small towns and forests in its path.\nWhat are the causes of avalanches?\n\nAvalanches occur as layers in a snowpack slide off.\n\nA snowpack is simply layers of snow that build up in an area, such as the side of a mountain.\nIn winter, repeated snowfalls build a snowpack dozens of meters thick.\nThe layers vary in thickness and texture, and the bonds between the layers of a snowpack may be weak.\n\nThere are numerous natural and man-made factors responsible for an avalanche.\n\nHeavy Snowfall: When a high rate of snowfall occurs, it leads to snow accumulation on the mountain slopes. This triggers the weaker layer of snow in the snowpack of unstable areas of the mountain causing avalanches.\nWind Direction: The direction of the wind determines the patterns of the snowfall as well as snow accumulation on the mountain slopes.\nLayering of Snow: The gradual snowfall creates a layer-by-layer accumulation of snow that creates a hypersensitive snowpack. A small trigger can cause these layers of snow to fall.\nSteeper Slopes: An avalanche is also caused by the influence of gravity. If the snow gets accumulates on the slopes of the mountain, then it is prone to rush down the slopes at greater speeds.\nHigh Temperatures: Temperature is one of the important factors for the avalanche because of high temperatures the surface layer of the snowpack gets melted. The accumulated snow will become highly susceptible to sliding down.\nEarthquakes: It is one of the important factors that trigger the layer of accumulated snowpack because earthquakes generate seismic waves that cause the ground to vibrate.\nDevelopmental activities: During the developmental activities, the terrain vehicles in regions with unstable layers of snow can dislodge the layers from the surface and cause them to slide down under gravity.\nDeforestation: Clearing trees and forests causes the soil to become loose, hence during snowfall the ground does not have the strength to hold the heavy snow. This causes landslides or avalanches of rocks and soil.\nWinter Sports Activities: At times, excessive pressure is transferred to snow layers during winter sports activities like skis and sledding. Excess of these activities can cause the topmost loose layer of snow to slip and eventually cause a greater catastrophe.\nMitigation\n\nAt present, it is difficult for scientists to predict with certainty when and where avalanches will happen. However, they can estimate hazard levels by checking the snowpack, temperature, and wind conditions.\n\nCertain measures like avalanche detention walls, rakes, diversion structures, etc, can be employed in areas prone to avalanches.\n\nAt some ski areas, patrols use explosives to set off avalanches. Or they may blast hazardous slopes with a cannon to shake loose any large, new accumulations of snow.\n\nConclusion\n\nAvalanches strike suddenly and can be deadly, and are one of the most powerful events in nature.\n\nIn 1970, a massive avalanche of rocks and ice destroyed the town of Yungay, Peru, killing 18,000 people.\nDuring World War I, more than 60,000 Italian and Austrian troops died in avalanches while fighting in snowy mountain passes in the Alps.\nAvalanches killed more soldiers in World War I than poison gas did.\n\nIn India, the National disaster management authority (NDMA) brings out mitigation and survival guidelines for avalanches. All major ski regions in the country post warnings based on local knowledge.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Read further to know more.\n\nStars play a vital role in the universe, as they are responsible for the creation of heavy elements through the process of nucleosynthesis.\u00a0 There are different stages in the life cycle of a star.\n\nA star is a massive, luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. It is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, and its energy is produced by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The immense heat and pressure generated by these reactions cause the star to emit light and heat, which radiate out into space.\n\nThere are many different types of stars, ranging from small, cool, dim stars known as red dwarfs to massive, hot, bright stars known as blue giants.

Here are the general stages of a star\u2019s life:\n\nStellar Nebula\n\nA stellar nebula is a cloud of gas and dust in space, mainly composed of hydrogen and helium, which is the birthplace of stars. These nebulae are typically several light-years in size and can be observed in our galaxy and others.\n\nStellar nebulae are formed from the remnants of previous generations of stars, which have exploded in supernovae, releasing heavy elements into space. These elements combine with hydrogen and helium gas to form nebulae.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGravity is the force that causes the nebulae to contract, which increases the density and temperature of the gas and dust. As the density and temperature increase, nuclear fusion reactions begin, and a protostar is formed at the center of the nebula.\n\nProtostar\n\nA protostar is a stage in the formation of a star, where a dense core of gas and dust within a stellar nebula begins to contract under the force of gravity. As the protostar continues to contract, the temperature and pressure at its center increase, eventually reaching a point where nuclear fusion reactions begin.\n\nThe protostar stage is an important step in the formation of stars, as it marks the transition from a cloud of gas and dust to a self-sustaining star. Protostars are typically much larger than their final form, and they continue to contract and heat up until they reach the main sequence stage of their lifecycle.\n\nDuring the protostar stage, the nuclear fusion reactions are not yet strong enough to sustain the star over the long term. Instead, the protostar radiates energy that is generated by the gravitational contraction of its material.\n\nAlso read: LIGO-India\n\nMain Sequence\n\nThe main sequence is a stage in the lifecycle of a star, where it fuses hydrogen atoms in its core to form helium. This is the stage where the star will spend most of its life, and it is characterized by a stable balance between the inward force of gravity and the outward pressure generated by nuclear fusion reactions.\n\nStars in the main sequence stage come in a range of sizes and temperatures, with the most massive and hottest stars located in the upper left of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and the least massive and coolest stars located in the lower right.\n\nThe length of time a star spends in the main sequence stage depends on its mass. Higher-mass stars have hotter and more massive cores, which allow them to fuse hydrogen more quickly and have shorter main sequence lifetimes. Lower-mass stars, on the other hand, have cooler and less massive cores, which allow them to fuse hydrogen more slowly and have longer main sequence lifetimes.\n\nDuring the main sequence stage, stars are in a state of equilibrium, where the outward pressure generated by nuclear fusion reactions is balanced by the inward force of gravity. This equilibrium is maintained until the star exhausts its supply of hydrogen fuel in the core, leading to further changes in its evolution.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRed Giant\n\nA red giant is a stage in the evolution of a star that has exhausted the hydrogen fuel in its core. As the core contracts and heats up, the outer layers of the star expand and cool, causing the star to increase in size and become much brighter.\n\nDuring the red giant stage, the star fuses helium into heavier elements in a shell around the core. This shell fusion generates more energy than the fusion reactions in the core, causing the outer layers of the star to expand and cool.\n\nRed giants are much larger and cooler than main-sequence stars of the same mass. They are characterized by a reddish color and have relatively low surface temperatures, ranging from about 2,500 to 4,000 Kelvin.\n\nThe length of time a star spends in the red giant stage depends on its mass. Higher-mass stars have larger and more massive cores, which allows them to generate more heat and pressure, causing them to spend less time as red giants. Lower-mass stars, on the other hand, have smaller and less massive cores, which causes them to spend longer in the red giant stage.\n\nAs the red giant stage progresses, the outer layers of the star continue to expand and cool, until they eventually become so diffuse that they are lost to space. The core of the star contracts and heats up, leading to further changes in its evolution.\n\nPlanetary Nebula\n\nA planetary nebula is a type of emission nebula that is formed when a low- to intermediate-mass star reaches the end of its life and enters the final stages of its evolution.\n\nDuring this stage, the outer layers of the star are expelled into space, forming a shell of gas and dust that surrounds a hot, dense core known as a white dwarf. The expanding shell of gas and dust is ionized by the intense ultraviolet radiation emitted by the white dwarf, causing it to glow brightly and create a planetary nebula.\n\nAlso read: Nobel Prize\n\nWhite Dwarf\n\nThe core of the red giant will collapse to form a hot, dense object known as a white dwarf. This is the final stage of life for low to medium-mass stars.\n\nA white dwarf is a dense, compact object that is formed when a low- to intermediate-mass star exhausts its nuclear fuel and sheds its outer layers to form a planetary nebula. The core of the star, which is composed mostly of carbon and oxygen, collapses under its own weight to form a hot, dense ball of matter.\n\nWhite dwarfs are one of the end states of stellar evolution for stars with initial masses up to about 8 solar masses. Higher-mass stars will continue to evolve and eventually explode as supernovae, leaving behind neutron stars or black holes. White dwarfs are also important objects for understanding the age of star clusters and the overall age of the Universe, as they provide a lower limit on the age of these systems.\n\nSupernova\n\nA supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion that occurs when a star has reached the end of its life and runs out of nuclear fuel. The explosion is so bright that it can briefly outshine an entire galaxy, and can release as much energy as the Sun will over its entire lifetime.\n\nSupernovae play an important role in the chemical evolution of the Universe, as they release heavy elements and other materials into space that can be used to form new stars and planets. They are also important for understanding the processes that occur in the most extreme environments in the Universe, such as the interiors of neutron stars and black holes. Finally, supernovae are valuable tools for measuring the distance to galaxies and for studying the expansion of the Universe.\n\nAlso read: GRAPES-3 Experiment\n\nNeutron Star or Black Hole\n\nThe core of a massive star may collapse into a neutron star or black hole, depending on its mass. These objects are extremely dense and have strong gravitational fields.\n\nA neutron star is an extremely dense and compact object that is made up of tightly packed neutrons. It is formed when the core of a massive star collapses under its own weight and the electrons and protons in the core combine to form neutrons. Neutron stars are often observed as pulsars, which are rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit beams of radiation from their magnetic poles.\n\nA black hole, on the other hand, is a region of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. It is formed when the core of a massive star collapses to a point of infinite density, known as a singularity. The event horizon, which is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape, is determined by the mass and spin of the black hole.

The\u00a0Gulf of Mexico\u00a0lies to the northwest.\nENGLISH CHANNEL\nThe English Channel, also known as simply\u00a0the Channel, is an arm of the\u00a0Atlantic Ocean\u00a0that separates\u00a0Southern England\u00a0from northern\u00a0France.\nIt links to the southern part of the\u00a0North Sea\u00a0by the\u00a0Strait of Dover\u00a0at its northeastern end. It is the busiest\u00a0shipping area\u00a0in the world.\nGULF OF MEXICO\nThe Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean, largely surrounded by the North American continent.\nIt is bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States; on the southwest and south by the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo; and on the southeast by Cuba.\nHUDSON BAY\nHudson Bay sometimes called Hudson\u2019s Bay, is a large body of saltwater in northeastern\u00a0Canada\u00a0with a surface area of 1,230,000\u00a0km2\u00a0(470,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\nIt is located north of Ontario, west of Quebec, northeast of Manitoba, and southeast of Nunavut, but politically entirely part of Nunavut.\u00a0It is an\u00a0inland\u00a0marginal sea\u00a0of the\u00a0Arctic Ocean.\nIRISH SEA\nThe Irish Sea\u00a0is an extensive body of water that separates the islands of\u00a0Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Great Britain.\nIt is linked to the\u00a0Celtic Sea\u00a0in the south by\u00a0St George\u2019s Channel\u00a0and to the\u00a0Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the\u00a0North Channel.\u00a0Anglesey,\u00a0North Wales, is the largest\u00a0island\u00a0in the Irish Sea, followed by the\u00a0Isle of Man.\u00a0\nLABRADOR SEA\nThe Labrador Sea is an arm of the North Atlantic Ocean between the Labrador Peninsula and Greenland. The sea is flanked by continental shelves to the southwest, northwest, and northeast.\nIt connects to the north with\u00a0Baffin Bay\u00a0through the\u00a0Davis Strait.\nMEDITERRANEAN SEA\nThe Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin, and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and the east by the Levant.\nThe Mediterranean has played a central role in the history of Western civilization. Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over some 600,000 years during the Messinian salinity crisis before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago.\nNORTH SEA\nThe North Sea\u00a0lies between\u00a0Great Britain,\u00a0Denmark,\u00a0Norway,\u00a0Germany, the\u00a0Low Countries, and\u00a0France. An\u00a0epeiric\u00a0sea on the\u00a0European\u00a0continental shelf, it connects to the\u00a0Atlantic Ocean\u00a0through the\u00a0English Channel\u00a0in the south and the\u00a0Norwegian Sea\u00a0in the north.\nIt is more than 970 kilometers (600 mi) long and 580 kilometers (360 mi) wide, covering 570,000 square kilometers (220,000 sq mi).\nNORWEGIAN SEA\nThe Norwegian Sea is a marginal sea, grouped with either the Atlantic Ocean or the Arctic Ocean, northwest of Norway between the North Sea and the Greenland Sea, adjoining the Barents Sea to the northeast.\nIn the southwest, it is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a submarine ridge running between\u00a0Iceland\u00a0and the\u00a0Faroe Islands. To the north, the\u00a0Jan Mayen\u00a0Ridge separates it from the Greenland Sea.\nSCOTIA SEA\nThe Scotia Sea\u00a0is a\u00a0sea\u00a0located at the northern edge of the\u00a0Southern Ocean\u00a0at its boundary with the\u00a0South Atlantic Ocean. It is bounded on the west by the\u00a0Drake Passage\u00a0and on the north, east, and south by the\u00a0Scotia Arc, an\u00a0undersea ridge\u00a0and\u00a0island arc\u00a0system supporting various islands.\nThe sea sits atop the\u00a0Scotia Plate. It is named after the expedition ship\u00a0Scotia. Many\u00a0icebergs\u00a0melt there.\nMarginal seas of the Indian Ocean\nANDAMAN SEA\nThe Andaman Sea\u00a0(historically also known as the\u00a0Burma Sea) is a marginal sea of the northeastern Indian Ocean bounded by the coastlines of Myanmar and Thailand along the Gulf of Martaban and the west side of the Malay Peninsula and separated from the Bay of Bengal to its west by the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands. Its southern end is at Breueh Island just north of Sumatra, with the Strait of Malacca further southeast.\nARABIAN SEA\nThe Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan, Iran, and the Gulf of Oman, on the west by the Gulf of Aden, Guardafui Channel, and the Arabian Peninsula, on the southeast by the Laccadive Sea and the Maldives, on the southwest by Somalia, and the east by India.\nIts total area is 3,862,000\u00a0km2\u00a0(1,491,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and its maximum depth is 4,652 meters (15,262\u00a0ft). The Gulf of Aden in the west connects the Arabian Sea to the\u00a0Red Sea\u00a0through the strait of\u00a0Bab-el-Mandeb, and the\u00a0Gulf of Oman\u00a0is in the northwest, connecting it to the\u00a0Persian Gulf.\nBAY OF BENGAL\nThe Bay of Bengal is the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean, bounded on the west and northwest by India, on the north by Bangladesh, and the east by Myanmar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India.\nIts southern limit is a line between Sangaman Kanda, Sri Lanka, and the northwesternmost point of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is the largest water region called a bay in the world.\nThere are countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal in South Asia and Southeast Asia. During the existence of British India, it was named the Bay of Bengal after the historic Bengal region. At the time, the Port of Kolkata served as the gateway to the Crown\u2019s rule in India.\nCox\u2019s Bazar, the longest sea beach in the world, and Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest and the natural habitat of the Bengal tiger, are located along the bay.\nJAVA SEA\nThe Java Sea\u00a0is an extensive shallow sea on the\u00a0Sunda Shelf, between the\u00a0Indonesian\u00a0islands of\u00a0Borneo\u00a0to the north,\u00a0Java\u00a0to the south,\u00a0Sumatra\u00a0to the west, and\u00a0Sulawesi\u00a0to the east.\nKarimata Strait\u00a0to its northwest links it to the\u00a0South China Sea. It is a part of the western\u00a0Pacific Ocean.\nPERSIAN GULF\nThe Persian Gulf sometimes called the Arabian Gulf is a Mediterranean sea in Western Asia. The body of water is an extension of the Arabian Sea located between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula.\nIt is connected to the Gulf of Oman in the east by the Strait of Hormuz. The Shatt al-Arab River delta forms the northwest shoreline.\nRED SEA\nThe Red Sea is a\u00a0seawater\u00a0inlet\u00a0of the\u00a0Indian Ocean, lying between\u00a0Africa\u00a0and\u00a0Asia. Its connection to the ocean is in the south, through the\u00a0Bab el Mandeb\u00a0strait and the\u00a0Gulf of Aden.\nTo its north lie the\u00a0Sinai Peninsula, the\u00a0Gulf of Aqaba, and the\u00a0Gulf of Suez\u00a0(leading to the\u00a0Suez Canal). It is underlain by the\u00a0Red Sea Rift, which is part of the\u00a0Great Rift Valley.\nSEA OF ZANJ\nThe Sea of Zanj\u00a0is a former name for that portion of the western\u00a0Indian Ocean\u00a0adjacent to the region in the\u00a0African Great Lakes\u00a0referred to by\u00a0medieval\u00a0Arab\u00a0geographers as\u00a0Zanj.\nThe Sea of Zanj was deemed a fearful zone by Arab mariners and legends regarding dangers in the waters abounded, especially near its far southern limits.\nMarginal seas of the Mediterranean Sea\n\nMajor conflict zones lie in the east of the Mediterranean. Also, the recent refugee crisis is constantly in the news. Hence the locations from the region are important for prelims.\n\nADRIATIC SEA\nThe Adriatic Sea\u00a0is a body of water separating the\u00a0Italian Peninsula\u00a0from the\u00a0Balkan Peninsula.\nThe Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley.\nThe countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Italy, Montenegro, and Slovenia.\nAEGEAN SEA\nThe Aegean Sea is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea between Europe and Asia. It is located between the Balkans and Anatolia and covers an area of some 215,000 square kilometers.\nIn the north, the Aegean is connected to the Marmara Sea and the Black Sea by the straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. The Aegean Islands are located within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes.\nThe sea reaches a maximum depth of 2,639m to the west of Karpathos. The Thracian Sea and the Sea of Crete are the main subdivisions of the Aegean Sea.\nMarginal seas of the Pacific Ocean\nBERING SEA\nThe Bering Sea is a marginal sea of the Northern Pacific Ocean. It forms, along with the Bering Strait, the divide between the two largest landmasses on Earth: Eurasia and The Americas. It comprises a deep water basin, which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves. The Bering Sea is named after Vitus Bering, a Danish navigator in Russian service, who, in 1728, was the first European to systematically explore it, sailing from the Pacific Ocean northward to the Arctic Ocean.\nCELEBES SEA\nThe Celebes Sea or Sulawesi Sea, of the western Pacific Ocean, is bordered on the north by the Sulu Archipelago and Sulu Sea and Mindanao Island of the Philippines, on the east by the Sangihe Islands chain, on the south by Sulawesi\u2019s Minahasa Peninsula, and the west by northern Kalimantan in Indonesia.\nIt extends 420 miles (675\u00a0km) north-south by 520\u00a0mi (840\u00a0km) east-west and has a total surface area of 110,000 square miles (280,000\u00a0km2), to a maximum depth of 20,300 feet (6,200 m).\u00a0South of Cape Mangkalihat, the sea opens southwest through the\u00a0Makassar Strait\u00a0into the\u00a0Java Sea.\nCORAL SEA\nThe Coral Sea is a marginal sea of the South Pacific off the northeast coast of Australia and is classified as an interim Australian bioregion. The Coral Sea extends 2,000 kilometers (1,200 mi) down the Australian northeast coast.\nMost of it is protected by the French Natural Park of the Coral Sea and the Australian Coral Sea Marine Park. The sea was the location for the Battle of the Coral Sea, a major confrontation during World War II between the navies of the Empire of Japan, the United States, and Australia.\nEAST CHINA SEA\nThe East China Sea\u00a0is an arm of the\u00a0Western Pacific Ocean, located directly offshore from\u00a0East China. It covers an area of roughly 1,249,000 square kilometers (482,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\nThe sea\u2019s northern extension between\u00a0mainland China\u00a0and the\u00a0Korean Peninsula\u00a0is the\u00a0Yellow Sea, separated by an\u00a0imaginary line\u00a0between the eastern tip of\u00a0Qidong\u00a0at the\u00a0Yangtze River\u00a0estuary\u00a0and the southwestern tip of\u00a0South Korea\u2019s\u00a0Jeju Island.\nPHILIPPINE SEA\nThe Philippine Sea\u00a0is a\u00a0marginal sea\u00a0of the\u00a0Western Pacific Ocean\u00a0east of the\u00a0Philippine archipelago\u00a0(hence the name), the largest in the world, occupying an estimated\u00a0surface area\u00a0of 5\u00a0million square kilometers (2\u00d7106\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\n\u00a0The\u00a0Philippine Sea Plate\u00a0forms the floor of the sea. Its western border is the\u00a0first island chain\u00a0to the west, comprising the\u00a0Ryukyu Islands\u00a0in the northwest and\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0in the west\nSEA OF JAPAN\nThe Sea of Japan\u00a0is the\u00a0marginal sea\u00a0between the\u00a0Japanese archipelago,\u00a0Sakhalin, the\u00a0Korean Peninsula, and the mainland of the\u00a0Russian Far East. The Japanese archipelago separates the sea from the\u00a0Pacific Ocean. Like the\u00a0Mediterranean Sea, it has almost no\u00a0tides\u00a0due to its nearly complete enclosure from the Pacific Ocean.\nThis isolation also affects faunal diversity and salinity, both of which are lower than in the open ocean. The sea has no large islands, bays, or capes. Its water balance is mostly determined by the inflow and outflow through the straits connecting it to the neighboring seas and the Pacific Ocean. Few rivers discharge into the sea and their total contribution to the water exchange is within 1%.\nSEA OF OKHOTSK\nThe Sea of Okhotsk is a marginal sea of the western Pacific Ocean. It is located between\u00a0Russia\u2019s\u00a0Kamchatka Peninsula\u00a0on the east, the\u00a0Kuril Islands\u00a0on the southeast,\u00a0Japan\u2019s island of\u00a0Hokkaido\u00a0on the south, the island of\u00a0Sakhalin\u00a0along the west, and a stretch of eastern\u00a0Siberian\u00a0coast along the west and north.\nThe northeast corner is the Shelikhov Gulf. The sea is named after the Okhota River, which is in turn named after the Even word (okat) meaning \u201criver\u201d.\nSOUTH CHINA SEA\nThe South China Sea, or South East Asian Sea, is a marginal sea of the Western Pacific Ocean. It is bounded in the north by the shores of South China, in the west by the Indochinese Peninsula, in the east by the islands of Taiwan and northwestern Philippines, and in the south by Borneo, eastern Sumatra, and the Bangka Belitung Islands, encompassing an area of around 3,500,000 km2\u00a0(1,400,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\nIt communicates with the East China Sea via the Taiwan Strait, the Philippine Sea via the Luzon Strait, the Sulu Sea via the straits around Palawan (e.g. the Mindoro and Balabac Straits), the Strait of Malacca via the Singapore Strait, and the Java Sea via the Karimata and Bangka Straits.\nTASMAN SEA\nThe Tasman Sea is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand.\nIt measures about 2,000\u00a0km (1,200\u00a0mi) across and about 2,800\u00a0km (1,700\u00a0mi) from north to south.\n\nYELLOW SEA\nThe Yellow Sea is a marginal sea of the Western Pacific Ocean located between mainland China and the Korean Peninsula and can be considered the northwestern part of the East China Sea.\nIt is one of four seas named after common color terms (the others being the Black Sea, the Red Sea, and the White Sea), and its name is descriptive of the golden-yellow color of the silt-ridden water discharged from major rivers.\nOTHER SEAS\nThe Caribbean Sea is sometimes defined as a marginal sea, sometimes as a Mediterranean sea.\nThe Caspian Sea is also sometimes defined as a marginal sea, and also the Dead Sea.\nPhytoplankton Bloom (Algal Bloom) in Marginal Seas\nThe Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea are marginal seas found in proximity to one another. The color difference shown here is due to a\u00a0phytoplankton bloom\u00a0occurring in the Black Sea.\nPhytoplankton is good as fish feed on them. But when they proliferate indiscriminately, they consume too much oxygen during the night, thus depriving other marine organisms of oxygen.\nFor example, the discharge of domestic sewage leads to elevated nutrient concentrations (particularly\u00a0phosphates) which can result in harmful\u00a0algal blooms.\nBiomass Production and Primary Productivity\nMarine biomass production originates with primary productivity, which in turn is affected by the availability of sunlight, carbon dioxide, nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates, and trace elements.\nMarginal seas generally exhibit intermediate levels of primary production, with the\u00a0highest rates found in coastal upwelling regions\u00a0and the\u00a0lowest primary production occurring in open ocean regions.\nHence, the highest biomass production rates occur in coastal upwelling zones, the lowest in open ocean regions, and intermediate rates in marginal seas.\nFor near-shore regions, the dominant processes influencing primary productivity are river runoff, water column mixing, and turbidity.\nRiver runoff and water column mixing introduce dissolved nutrients, trace elements, and suspended particles into the photic (light) zones of near-shore regions.\nAlthough the addition of dissolved nutrients and trace elements to coastal waters and marginal seas serves to increase primary production, the addition of suspended particles increases water\u00a0turbidity, which results in reduced sunlight penetration and\u00a0decreased\u00a0primary productivity.\nWater Circulation in Marginal Seas\nWater circulation patterns in marginal seas depend largely on the shape of the sea, fresh-water input (e.g., river runoff and precipitation), and evaporation.\nIf river\u00a0runoff and precipitation exceed evaporation, as is the case in the Black and Baltic Seas, the excess fresh water will tend to flow seaward near the sea surface.\nIf evaporation exceeds river runoff and precipitation, as in the Mediterranean Sea, the marginal sea water becomes\u00a0saltier, then sinks and flows towards the less salty open ocean region.\nBays, gulfs, and Straits\nBays, gulfs, and straits are types of water bodies that are contained within a larger body of water near land.\nThese three water bodies are usually located at important points of human activities; thus, conflicts with nature and neighbors are common.\nBays\nA bay is a small body of water that is set off from a larger body of water generally where the land curves inward.\nIn simple words, a bay is a water body surrounded on three sides by land with the fourth side (mouth) wide open towards oceans. (In Gulfs, the mouth is narrow).\nA bay is usually smaller and\u00a0less enclosed than a gulf.\nExamples: The Bay of Pigs (Cuba), Hudson Bay (Canada), Bay of Bengal, etc.\nAn example of a bay at a river\u2019s mouth in New York Bay, at the mouth of the Hudson River (Hudson Estuary).\nGuant\u00e1namo Bay\nGuant\u00e1namo Bay is a sheltered inlet within the Caribbean Sea.\nDuring the Spanish-American War in 1898, the United States gained access to the outer harbor of Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\nThrough an agreement signed with Cuba in 1903, the United States obtained the right to maintain a naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\nIn 1934, a treaty reaffirmed the U.S. right to lease the site. The treaty gave the United States a perpetual lease on Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\nThe most infamous Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison is here.\nGulfs\nA gulf is a large body of water, sometimes with a narrow mouth, that is almost surrounded by land. The world\u2019s largest gulf is the Gulf of Mexico.\nExamples of other gulfs include the Gulf of California, the Gulf of Aden (between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea), and the Persian Gulf (between Saudi Arabia and Iran).\nThe Persian Gulf is important concerning world energy because petroleum is transported through its waters in oil tankers.\nStraits\nA strait is a narrow passageway of water, usually between continents or islands, or between two larger bodies of water.\nThe\u00a0Strait of Gibraltar\u00a0is probably the world\u2019s most famous strait. It connects the Atlantic Ocean on its west with the Mediterranean Sea on its east.\nTwo other well-known straits are the\u00a0Strait of Bosporus\u00a0and the\u00a0Strait of Hormuz.\nThe Strait of Bosporus connects the\u00a0Black Sea (from the north) and the Sea of Marmara (from the south), and splits northwestern Turkey.\nThe Strait of Hormuz is located at the\u00a0southeastern end of the Persian Gulf. It is a narrow waterway that can be (and has been) controlled to prevent ships from sailing through the gulf.\nChoke Point\nWhen a body of water such as a strait is capable of being blocked or even closed to control transportation routes, the body is called a \u201cchoke point.\u201d\nHistorically, the Strait of Gibraltar has been one of the world\u2019s most important choke points.\nHowever, the Strait of Hormuz has become an important choke point in recent years because of increasing Middle East tensions.\nThe Strait is surrounded by the United Arab Emirates Oman (on one side) and Iran (on the other side).\nIsthmus\nThe isthmus is the land equivalent of a strait. i.e., a narrow strip of land connecting two larger land masses.\nExample:\u00a0Isthmus of Panama\u00a0and\u00a0Isthmus of Suez.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)",

There are five major oceans in the world- the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arctic Ocean and Southern Ocean.\n\nPacific Ocean:\nIt is the biggest ocean on the planet. It occupies one-third of the earth\u2019s surface and is larger than all the continents combined. Asia and Australia are separated from North and South America by the Pacific Ocean.\nBecause he perceived the ocean to be quiet, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan gave it the name Pacific Ocean, which translates as \u201cpeaceful\u201d.\nThe Pacific Ocean is where the International Date Line is located. By the Indonesian Seaway, the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean are connected (Torres strait and strait of Malacca).\nThe ocean here has an average depth of 4280 metres.\nThe world\u2019s deepest oceanic trench is the Mariana trench, which is located in the western Pacific Ocean.\nAtlantic Ocean:\nIt is the world\u2019s second-largest ocean. 20% of the earth\u2019s surface is covered by it.\nIts name, Atlantis Thalassa, which means Sea of Atlas, comes from Greek mythology.\nBetween Africa, Europe, the Arctic Ocean, the Americas, and the Southern Ocean, it is a body of water with an extended S shape. 3,646 metres is about how deep this ocean is on average.\nPuerto Rico Trench is the deepest trench in the Atlantic Ocean (8,376 m).\nIn the distant past, when the supercontinent Pangaea broke up, the north Atlantic Ocean was created, and Gondwanaland broke up, the south Atlantic Ocean was created.\nGreenland, the largest island, is found in the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe Atlantic Ocean contains the Sargasso Sea, the only sea in the world without a shore.\nThe Atlantic and Indian oceans converge in the southeast.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Bottom topography of Atlantic Ocean\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndian Ocean:\nIndia, which makes up a large portion of its northern border, inspired the name.\nThe eastern hemisphere is where it is located. 19.8% of the surface of the earth\u2019s water is covered by it.\nIt is situated between Asia, Australia, the Southern Ocean, and Africa. It is the world\u2019s hottest ocean and is enclosed by land in the northern hemisphere.\nMadagascar is the biggest island in the Indian Ocean (the fourth largest island in the world).\nThe deepest trench in the Indian Ocean is called the Sunda/Java Trench and is about 7450 metres deep.\nThe Indian Ocean\u2019s marginal seas are crucial for trade because they provide vital marine lanes that link the Middle East, East Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas.\nThe Indian Ocean\u2019s marginal seas are crucial for trade because they provide vital marine lanes that link the Middle East, East Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. An island, peninsula, or collection of islands that encloses a portion of an ocean is known as a marginal sea (group of islands). They are located close to land and are shallower than the ocean.\nSouthern Ocean:\nThe southernmost parts of the world\u2019s oceans are collectively referred to as the Antarctic Ocean or Austral Ocean.\nIt is the second-smallest and fourth-largest ocean in the world, surrounding Antarctica south of 60\u00b0S latitude.\nThe Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans round its northernmost (and largest) border. The seas of this ocean are notoriously tumultuous.\nBetween Chile\u2019s Cape Horn in South America and Antarctica\u2019s South Shetland Islands is a body of water known as the Drake Passage. It is renowned for having severe storms. It stretches into the Southern Ocean and joins the southwest corner of the Atlantic (Scotia sea) with the southeast corner of the Pacific.\nArctic Ocean:\nIn comparison to the other four oceans, the Arctic Ocean is shallower and smaller. The Arctic Circle encompasses the entire area.\nIt covers roughly 1.3% of the water surface of the planet.\nEurasia and North America encircle it. In the winter, ice fully covers it. Of the five great oceans, its salinity is the lowest on average.\nThe Greenland Sea, Labrador Sea, and Norwegian Sea connect the Arctic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean while the Bering Strait connects it to the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe deepest spot in the Arctic Ocean is the Molloy Deep, or \u201cMolloy Hole,\u201d which is located in the Fram Strait (inside the Greenland Sea).\n\nThe temperature of Oceans\nSimilar to land, ocean waters also become warmer due to sun radiation. Oceanic water warms and cools more slowly than land-based water.\nTemperature Distribution Influences Ocean water temperature distribution is influenced by several factors, including:\nLatitude: As one moves further away from the poles, the amount of insolation decreases, causing the temperature of surface water to drop.\nUneven distribution of land and water: The northern hemisphere\u2019s oceans experience greater heat because they are in contact with a larger area of land than the southern hemisphere\u2019s oceans.\nPrevailing wind: The winds blowing from the land towards the oceans drive warm surface water away from the coast resulting in the upwelling of cold water from below. It results in the longitudinal variation in the temperature. Contrary to this, the onshore winds pile up warm water near the coast and this raises the temperature.\nOcean currents:\u00a0Warm ocean currents raise the temperature in cold areas while cold currents decrease the temperature in warm ocean areas. The Gulf stream (warm current) raises the temperature near the eastern coast of North America and the West Coast of Europe while the Labrador current (cold current) lowers the temperature near the northeast coast of North America.\nAll these factors influence the temperature of the ocean currents locally.\nThe enclosed seas in the low latitudes record relatively higher temperatures than the open seas; whereas the enclosed seas in the high latitudes have a lower temperatures than the open seas.\nThe salinity of Oceans\nSalinity is an important property of seawater. It is defined as the amount of salt (in grams) dissolved per kilogram (1000 g) of seawater. It is usually expressed as parts per thousand, ppt or \u00b0/\u2080\u2080. For example, 30 ppt means 30g of salt in 1000 g of seawater. A salinity of 24.7 ppt has been considered as the upper limit to demarcate brackish water.\nThe composition of seawater varies both spatially (varies from one area to another) and temporally (varies from one-time span to the other time unit- seasonally, yearly).\nHorizontal distribution of salinity of oceans\nOn average, the salinity decreases from the equator towards the poles. The highest salinity is observed between 20\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 N and S latitudes because this zone is characterized by high temperature, high evaporation and less rain than the equatorial region. Subpolar and polar zones record minimum salinity due to less evaporation.\nThe North Sea, though in higher latitude, records higher salinity due to more saline water brought by the North Atlantic Drift.\nBaltic Sea records low salinity due to the influx of river waters in large quantities.\nThe average salinity of Ithe ndian Ocean is 35\u00b0/\u2080\u2080..The Bay of Bengal records low salinity due to the influx of river water and the Arabian Sea has higher salinity due to high evaporation and a low influx of fresh water.\nHighest salinity in water bodies \u2013 Lake Van in turkey (330 \u00b0/\u2080\u2080), Dead Sea (238 \u00b0/\u2080\u2080), Great Salt Lake, Utah USA (220\u00b0/\u2080\u2080).\nVertical distribution of salinity\nThere is a marked difference in the salinity between the surface zones and the deep zones of the oceans. Salinity at the surface increases by the loss of water to ice or evaporation, or it decreases by the input of fresh waters. However, salinity at depth is very much fixed, because there is no way that water is lost or salt is added.\nAlthough salinity generally increases with depth, there is a distinct zone where the salinity increases sharply called the halocline.\nHighly saline sea water (dense) generally sinks below the lower saline sea water (less dense) which leads to the stratification of seawater.\nDensity stratification of oceans\nThe surface layer of lowest density \u2013 Also called photic zone as this layer is directly penetrated by solar radiation. It has a thickness of 100 m- 200 m. It carries only 2% of the total volume of ocean water.\nPycnocline layer of sharp density gradient \u2013 (by no means density). This layer is found between 300 m \u2013 1000 m depth of ocean water. It carries about 18% of the total volume of ocean water. Pycnocline (sharp density gradient), thermocline (steep temperature gradient) and halocline (sharp salinity gradient) occupy almost the same depth zones of 300 m \u2013 1000 m.\nThe bottom layer of highest but uniform density- It carries about 80% of the total volume of ocean water.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

Read further to know more.\n\nClassification of Lakes can be done on the Basis of Its Origin, Ecology, Size, Water Chemistry, etc manner.\n\nA lake is a large body of water that is surrounded by land. It is a type of inland waterway and can be natural or man-made. Lakes can be found all over the world, and they can vary in size, depth, and water chemistry. They can be formed by a variety of processes, including tectonic activity, glacial melting, volcanic activity, and human activity.\n\nLakes can support a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial life, and they are often important sources of water for human use, such as drinking, irrigation, and recreation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nClassification of Lakes\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Its Origin\nGlacial Lakes\nTectonic Lakes\nVolcanic Lakes\nSolution Lakes\nMan-made Lakes\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Ecology\nOligotrophic Lakes\nMesotrophic Lakes\nEutrophic Lakes\nHypereutrophic Lakes\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Water Chemistry\nAcidic Lakes\nAlkaline Lakes\nSaline Lakes\nEutrophic Lakes\nOligotrophic Lakes\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Size\nSmall Lakes\nMedium Lakes\nLarge Lakes\nGreat Lakes\nCrater Lakes\nImportance of Lakes\nClassification of Lakes\n\nClassification of lakes can be done on different criteria such as their origin, size, depth, location, water chemistry, and ecology.

A few important of them are:\n\nGlacial Lakes\n\nGlacial lakes are formed when glaciers melt and retreat, leaving behind depressions that fill with water. Glaciers are large bodies of ice that move slowly over time, eroding and shaping the landscape as they go. When a glacier retreats, it can leave behind a depression called a cirque or a valley that is then filled with water. Examples of glacial lakes include Lake Tahoe in California and Lake Louise in Alberta, Canada.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTectonic Lakes\n\nTectonic lakes are formed as a result of geological movements such as faulting and folding. When the earth\u2019s crust shifts and moves, it can create depressions that fill with water. These lakes can be found in areas with active tectonic activity, such as the Great Rift Valley in Africa. Lake Baikal in Russia is another example of a tectonic lake and is the deepest lake in the world.\n\nVolcanic Lakes\n\nVolcanic lakes are formed in the craters or calderas of active or extinct volcanoes. When a volcano erupts, it can create a depression that fills with water over time. These lakes can be found in areas with high volcanic activity, such as the Pacific Ring of Fire. One example of a volcanic lake is Crater Lake in Oregon, which was formed over 7,000 years ago when Mount Mazama erupted and collapsed.\n\nSolution Lakes\n\nSolution lakes are formed in areas with soluble rocks such as limestone and gypsum. When rainwater or groundwater comes into contact with these rocks, it can dissolve them and create depressions that fill with water. These lakes are typically found in areas with karst topography, such as the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. The Great Salt Lake in Utah is another example of a solution lake, formed from the evaporation of water that flowed into the area from rivers and streams.\n\nMan-made Lakes\n\nMan-made lakes are created by humans for various purposes such as irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, and recreation. These lakes can be found all over the world and are typically created by damming rivers or streams. Examples of man-made lakes include Lake Mead in Nevada, which was created by the Hoover Dam, and Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, which was created by the Kariba Dam.\n\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Ecology\n\nLakes are complex ecosystems that are influenced by a wide range of environmental factors, including water quality, temperature, nutrient availability, and surrounding land use.\n\nOligotrophic Lakes\n\nOligotrophic lakes are characterized by low nutrient levels and clear water. These lakes are often deep and have a low level of productivity, meaning that they support relatively few aquatic plants and animals. Oligotrophic lakes are typically found in areas with low human population densities and little agricultural activity. Examples of oligotrophic lakes include Lake Tahoe in California and Crater Lake in Oregon.\n\nMesotrophic Lakes\n\nMesotrophic lakes are characterized by moderate nutrient levels and relatively clear water. These lakes have a moderate level of productivity and support a wider range of aquatic plants and animals than oligotrophic lakes. Mesotrophic lakes are typically found in areas with moderate human population densities and some agricultural activity. Examples of mesotrophic lakes include Lake Champlain in Vermont and Lake Simcoe in Ontario, Canada.\n\nEutrophic Lakes\n\nEutrophic lakes are characterized by high nutrient levels and often have green or murky water. These lakes have a high level of productivity and support a wide range of aquatic plants and animals. Eutrophic lakes are typically found in areas with high human population densities and extensive agricultural activity. Examples of eutrophic lakes include Lake Erie in North America and Lake Taihu in China.\n\nHypereutrophic Lakes\n\nHypereutrophic lakes are characterized by extremely high nutrient levels and are often dominated by algae and other aquatic plants. These lakes have a very high level of productivity and can become choked with plant growth, leading to problems such as oxygen depletion and fish kills. Hypereutrophic lakes are typically found in areas with very high human population densities and extensive agricultural or urban development. Examples of hypereutrophic lakes include Lake Apopka in Florida and Lake Kasumigaura in Japan.\n\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Water Chemistry\n\nLakes are complex ecosystems that are influenced by a wide range of environmental factors, including water chemistry. Lets understand the different types of lakes based on their water chemistry, including their unique characteristics and examples of each type.\n\nAcidic Lakes\n\nAcidic lakes are characterized by low pH levels, typically below 5.0. These lakes are often found in areas with high levels of acid rain or areas with high levels of organic material that have decomposed and produced acids. Acidic lakes have low nutrient levels and can be inhospitable to many aquatic plants and animals. Examples of acidic lakes include the Adirondack Lakes in New York and the lakes in Scandinavia.\n\nAlkaline Lakes\n\nAlkaline lakes are characterized by high pH levels, typically above 8.5. These lakes are often found in areas with high levels of mineral salts, such as in arid regions or areas with volcanic activity. Alkaline lakes have high nutrient levels and can support a wide range of aquatic plants and animals, including some that are unique to alkaline environments. Examples of alkaline lakes include Mono Lake in California and Lake Nakuru in Kenya.\n\nSaline Lakes\n\nSaline lakes are characterized by high salt concentrations, typically above 3 grams per liter. These lakes are often found in arid regions where water evaporates quickly and leaves behind concentrated salts. Saline lakes have low nutrient levels and are often inhospitable to many aquatic plants and animals. However, some specialized species are adapted to these extreme environments. Examples of saline lakes include the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea in Israel.\n\nEutrophic Lakes\n\nEutrophic lakes are characterized by high nutrient levels, typically from agricultural runoff or wastewater discharge. These lakes have high levels of productivity and support a wide range of aquatic plants and animals. However, excessive nutrient levels can lead to problems such as harmful algal blooms and oxygen depletion, which can harm fish populations. Examples of eutrophic lakes include Lake Erie in North America and Lake Taihu in China.\n\nOligotrophic Lakes\n\nOligotrophic lakes are characterized by low nutrient levels and clear water. These lakes are often found in areas with low human population densities and little agricultural activity. Oligotrophic lakes have low levels of productivity and support relatively few aquatic plants and animals. Examples of oligotrophic lakes include Lake Tahoe in California and Crater Lake in Oregon.\n\nClassification of Lakes on the Basis of Size\n\nLakes come in a wide range of sizes, from small ponds to vast bodies of water that span multiple countries. A few important of them are:\n\nSmall Lakes\n\nSmall lakes are typically less than 1 square kilometer in size, and they are often referred to as ponds. They are usually shallow and have a maximum depth of around 6 meters. Small lakes can be found in a variety of environments, including forests, meadows, and wetlands. They often serve as important habitats for a variety of aquatic plants and animals, such as frogs, salamanders, and waterfowl.\n\nMedium Lakes\n\nMedium-sized lakes range in size from 1 to 100 square kilometers, with a maximum depth of around 30 meters. They are usually deeper than small lakes and often have clearer water. Medium-sized lakes can be found in a variety of environments, including mountainous regions and coastal areas. They often serve as important recreational resources, providing opportunities for swimming, boating, and fishing.\n\nLarge Lakes\n\nLarge lakes are typically greater than 100 square kilometers in size, and they often span multiple countries or regions. They can have a maximum depth of hundreds of meters, making them some of the deepest bodies of water in the world. Large lakes can be found in a variety of environments, including mountainous regions, coastal areas, and inland basins. They often serve as important resources for drinking water, hydroelectric power generation, and transportation.\n\nGreat Lakes\n\nThe Great Lakes are a group of five large lakes located in North America. They are Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. Together, they form the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world, with a total surface area of around 244,000 square kilometers. They have a maximum depth of over 200 meters and are an important resource for drinking water, transportation, and recreation.\n\nCrater Lakes\n\nCrater lakes are small to medium-sized lakes that are formed in volcanic craters. They can range in size from a few hundred meters to several kilometers in diameter. Crater lakes are often deep and clear, with a maximum depth of hundreds of meters. They are typically found in areas with active or extinct volcanoes, such as the Pacific Ring of Fire. One example of a crater lake is Crater Lake in Oregon, which is the deepest lake in the United States.\n\nImportance of Lakes\n\nLakes are important for a variety of reasons, both ecological and human-related. Here are some of the key reasons why lakes are important:\n\nBiodiversity: Lakes support a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial life, including fish, birds, plants, and mammals. They are often home to many species that are unique to the lake ecosystem.\n\nWater Supply: Lakes are a vital source of freshwater for human use, including drinking water, irrigation, and industrial purposes. In many regions, lakes are the primary source of water for local communities.\n\nFlood Control: Lakes can help to control floods by absorbing excess water during heavy rainfall or snowmelt. They can act as natural buffers that reduce the impact of floods on downstream areas.\n\nRecreation: Lakes provide opportunities for recreational activities such as swimming, boating, and fishing. They are popular destinations for tourists and locals alike, and they contribute to the economy through tourism and related industries.\n\nClimate Regulation: Lakes can help to regulate the local climate by releasing moisture into the air and cooling surrounding areas through evaporation.\n\nCultural Significance: Many lakes have cultural and spiritual significance for local communities. They may be associated with local myths and legends or used for religious ceremonies and rituals.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Mountain passes between peaks can arise during the construction of a mountain range or as a result of glaciers, rushing water, or precipitation in the form of rain or snow.\n\nAt lower heights, it is referred to as a hill pass. Most pass tops are flat and formed like a saddle.\n\nThese might be little, high peaks or enormous valleys that span for miles. Passes are typically found near the headwaters of rivers supplied by rain and snowmelt. It does not need to be flat, but it must be much lower in elevation than the other mountains.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMountain Passes in India\n\nMountain passes, also known as Himalayan passes, can be found in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttrakhand, and the northeastern provinces of India.\n\nDue to the continuous nature of mountain ranges, mountain passes are notably present in Maharashtra, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu in the Western Ghats.\n\nMajor Mountain Passes in Leh-Ladakh\n\nMajor Passes in Leh-Ladakh include Chang La, Bara-Lacha La Pass, Khardung La Pass, Imis La etc.\n\nChang La\nChang La provides access to Pangong Lake from Leh.\nIt is one of the highest motorable passes, with an elevation of 17,590 feet.\nThe Defence Research and Development Organization is located near Chang La.\nYou are not recommended to spend too much time there due to the low oxygen level.\nBara-Lacha La Pass\nThe Bara-Lacha La is a well-known mountain pass in Ladakh.\nThis Himalayan Zanskar Range pass connects Lahual and Ladakh and is regarded as the \u201cGateway to Ladakh.\u201d\nThis wonderful location has always been a historical monument, once functioning as a vital trading route.\nKhardung La Pass\nKhardung La is a Tibetan mountain range.\nBorder Roads Organizations are responsible for overseeing it.\nIt serves as a gateway to valleys like Nubra Valley.\nIt is crucial in the transport of supplies to the Siachen Glacier.\nImis La\nIt connects Ladakh with Tibet.\nThis is the beginning of the Hanle Valley, which is historically significant in terms of Buddhism.\nThe Zoji La Pass\nThis pass, located in Dras, connects three areas:\nKashmir Valley in the west, Indus Valley in the east, and Suru Valley in the north-east\nOwing to significant snowfall, construction of the Zoji La Tunnel began in 2020, making traffic even easier.\nTanglang La Pass\nTanglang La Pass is one of Ladakh\u2019s most stunning high-altitude mountain routes, rising 5,328 meters (17,480 ft).\nThis high-altitude mountain pass in Ladakh is around 49 kilometres long and connects Debring with Gya.\nMajor Mountain Passes in Jammu and Kashmir\n\nMajor Passes in Jammu and Kashmir consist of\u00a0 Karakoram Pass, Pir Panjal Pass, Banihal Pass, Burzail Pass, and Pensi La.\n\nAlso read: Avalanche: Types, Causes and Mitigation\n\nKarakoram Pass\nIt is located in the Karakoram Mountain range and connects India and China.\nIt performed an important historical role by allowing travellers to cross these mountain ranges.\nBecause of its desolate and uneven terrain, this pass is highly unpredictable.\nPir Panjal Pass\nIt connects the districts of Kashmir Valley and Rajouri.\nThe Mughal Road runs across this pass.\nIt is an essential link between India and Pakistan.\nBanihal Pass\nIn 1956, a trail from Jammu to Srinagar passed this mountain pass, and Jawahar Tunnel was built beneath it.\nLater on, the same path runs through the Jawahar Tunnel.\nThis pass is no longer valid as a result.\nThe Zaban Glacier is located near Banihal Pass.\nBurzail Pass\n\nThis pass connects the Astore Valley in Kashmir with the Deosai Plains in Ladakh.\n\nPensi La\nPensi La is a mountain pass that connects Kashmir with Kargil.\nIt can be found throughout the Himalayan range.\nMajor Mountain Passes in Himachal Pradesh\n\nMajor passes in Himachal Pradesh are Shipki La,\u00a0Rohtang Pass, Bara-Lacha La, and Debsa Pass.\n\nShipki La\nIt connects the Kinnaur and Tibet districts.

and connects the Pindari and Milam valleys.\nThis pass is incredibly difficult and steep.\nMangsha Dhura\nIt links the Indian states of Uttarakhand and Tibet.\nIt is also significant during the Manasarovar Yatra.\nMuling La\nIt is situated at an elevation of 5669 meters in the Great Himalayas, north of Gangotri.\nThis seasonal crossing connecting Uttarakhand and Tibet is snow-covered throughout the winter.\nMajor Mountain Passes in the North Eastern States\n\nMajor Passes in North Eastern states are Nathu La, Bom Di La, Jelep La, Diphu Pass etc.\n\nNathu La\nIt connects Sikkim with Tibet.\nIt is a gathering place for Indian and Chinese army troops, making it one of the sites where the two countries engage.\nIndian citizens must first obtain a permit to access this pass.\nBom Di La\nIt connects Arunachal Pradesh to Tibet, specifically Lhasa.\nIt is situated at an altitude of 8,556 feet.\nJelep La\nIt is an important trading pass because of the less uneven pathways between Sikkim, India, and Tibet.\nIt has been closed to the public since the Sino-Indian War in 1962.\nDiphu Pass\nDiphu Pass is situated on the MacMohan Line, which separates Tibet from India\u2019s northeast.\nIt is a three-country boundary shared by India, China, and Myanmar.\nDihang La\nIn the northeast, this pass connects the states of Arunachal Pradesh and Burma.\nIt is approximately 4000 meters above sea level.\nPangsau Pass\nIt is located in the state of Arunachal Pradesh.\nThis pass connects Arunachal Pradesh with Burma.\nPangsau Pass, also known as Pan Saung Pass, is located at a height of 3,727 feet on the summit of the Patkai Hills on the India-Burma (Myanmar) border (1,136 m).\nThe pass provides one of the most direct ways into Burma from the Assam plains.\nIt is named after Pangsau, a Burmese hamlet located two kilometres east of the pass.\nMajor Mountain Passes in the Western Ghats\n\nMajor Passes in the Western Ghats include\u00a0 Bhor Ghat, Thal Ghat, Palakkad Ghat, Shencottah gap, etc.\n\nBhor Ghat\nThis pass connects three different locations:\nBetween Palasdari and Khandala, there is a railway line.\nThe route between Khopoli and Khandala by road\nIt is located in the state of Maharashtra.\nThal Ghat\nIt is located on Mumbai-Nashik Road.\nThe railway line that travels through this pass is one of the steepest in India.\nIt connects Kalyan with Kasara in Maharashtra.\nPalakkad Ghat\nIt links the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.\nAnother name for it is the Palakkad Gap.\nIt\u2019s a tiny gap at an elevation of 460 feet.\nThe Pal Ghat runs through the Nilgiri and Anaimalai Hills.\nShencottah gap\nIt is found in the Western Ghats.\nIt connects the city of Madurai in Tamil Nadu with the district of Kottayam in Kerala.\nShencottah Gap, the second-largest gap in the Western Ghats, is located five kilometres from town and connects Shencottah and Punalur.\nRoad-rail lines pass through this gap, which connects Shencottah and Punalur.\nImportance of Mountain Passes\nPeople regularly use passes to get across mountainous mountain ranges since it is the most convenient option.\nAs a result, throughout history, they have played a key role in human movement, trade, and settlement.\nPasses are ideal locations for villages or defensive outposts since they are often the only level territory in a mountainous area.\nFrom this vantage point, a pass is also easier to defend against threats or foes.\nPasses act as a link between cultures that are separated by mountains in several places of the world.\nThe Khyber Pass, which goes over the Hindu Kush mountains and connects Pakistan and Afghanistan, has been an important trading route between Central and South Asia for thousands of years. It now connects Afghanistan\u2019s and Pakistan\u2019s modern cities of Kabul and Peshawar.\nConclusion\n\nIf a national border runs across a mountain range, there is frequently a pass through the mountains, as well as a border control or customs station and maybe a military installation. Passes, in addition to providing a reasonably straightforward route between valleys, also provide the shortest descent between two mountain tops.\n\nAs a result, tracks frequently cross at a pass, making them helpful even while traveling between a summit and the valley bottom. Snowdrifts can be a hazard on some mountain passes above the treeline in the winter.\n\nThis might be avoided by raising the road a few meters above ground level, allowing snow to blow off.\n\nRead:\u00a0Hindu Kush Himalaya\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Monsoon seasons account for two of the four seasons that exist on the Indian subcontinent. They are\n\nThe Southwest Monsoon Season\nThe North-East Monsoon Season\n\nThe name monsoon is derived from the Arabic word mausin or the Malayan word monsin, both of which means season. Monsoons are seasonal winds (rhythmic wind movements) (periodic winds) that reverse direction as the seasons change. The monsoon is a seasonal wind pattern that flows from sea to land in the summer and from land to sea in the winter. Some scholars consider monsoon winds to be large-scale land and marine breezes.\n\nMonsoons are unique to the Indian subcontinent, South East Asia, and sections of Central Western Africa, among other places.\nThey are more noticeable in the Indian Subcontinent than in any other place.\nConvection cells on a massive scale characterise Indian monsoons.\nThese are seasonal reversals in wind direction that occur on a regular or seasonal basis.\nIn the summer, India receives southwest monsoon winds, while in the winter, it receives northeast monsoon winds.\nSouth-west monsoons arise as a result of an intense low-pressure system that forms over the Tibetan plateau.\nHigh-pressure cells over the Tibetan and Siberian plateaus are related to the northeast monsoons.\nThe southwest monsoons deliver heavy rains to most of India, while the northeast monsoons bring rain to the country\u2019s south-eastern coast (The southern coast of Seemandhra and the coast of Tamil Nadu.).\nMechanism of Indian Monsoon\n\nMonsoons are not completely understood. Many ideas have been proposed to explain the mechanics of monsoons. The mechanism of the Indian monsoon which transforms vast sections of India from semi-desert to lush greenery still not completely known.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nClassical Theories\nThe Rig Veda, for example, mentions monsoons. Yet, the monsoon mechanism was not mentioned in these books.\nArab traders conducted the first scientific research on monsoon winds.\nArab traders exploited the maritime route to trade with India, and monsoon patterns were critical to their success.\nAl Masudi, an Arab explorer, described the reversal of ocean currents and the monsoon winds over the north Indian Ocean in the tenth century.\nSir Edmund Halley explained the monsoon in the seventeenth century as a result of thermal disparities between continents and oceans caused by differential heating.\nModern Theories\n\nAside from differential heating, the formation of the monsoon is determined by the geometry of the continents, orography (mountains), and the characteristics of upper troposphere air circulation (jet streams). As a result, Halley\u2019s idea has lost most of its relevance, whereas modern hypotheses based on air masses and jet streams are growing more important.\n\nClassical Theory: Sir Edmund Halley\u2019s Theory\n\nClassical theory is based on summer monsoons and winter monsoons.\n\nSummer Monsoon\nThe apparent route of the sun in summer is vertically above the Tropic of Cancer, resulting in high temperatures and low pressure in Central Asia.\nThe pressure is high enough across the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. As a result, in the summer, winds streamed from the oceans towards the mainland.\nThis airflow from the sea to the land brings significant rain to the Indian subcontinent.\nWinter Monsoon\nThe sun\u2019s apparent path in winter is vertically over the Tropic of Capricorn.\nThe northwestern section of India becomes colder than the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, and the monsoon flow is reversed.\nThe essential concept underpinning Classical theory is similar to the production of land and sea breezes, except that in the case of monsoons, day and night are substituted by summer and winter.\nDrawbacks\n\nMonsoons do not develop evenly everywhere on Earth, and Halley\u2019s thermal notion fails to describe the complexities of monsoons such as sudden bursts of monsoons, occasionally a delay in one set of monsoons, and so on.\n\nModern theory: Air Mass Theory\n\nAccording to this view, the monsoon is just a modification of the tropics\u2019 planetary winds. The notion is based on the seasonal migration of the ITCZ.\n\nRole of ITCZ [Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]\nNear the equator, the southeast trade winds of the southern hemisphere and the northeast trade winds of the northern hemisphere meet.\nThe Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone is where these winds collide (ITCZ).\nThis is the area of ascending air, the greatest clouds, and heavy rainfall.\nDuring the changing of the seasons, the location of the ITCZ varies north and south of the equator.\nDuring the summer, the sun shines vertically over the Tropic of Cancer, and the ITCZ shifts northward.\nUnder the influence of Coriolis force, the southern hemisphere\u2019s southeast trade winds cross the equator and begin blowing southwest to northeast.\nAs these displaced trade winds blow over the Indian subcontinent, they are known as south-west monsoons.\nThe Monsoon Front is the boundary between the south-west monsoons and the north-east trade winds (ITCZ). Along this front, rain falls.\nThe ITCZ shifts to 20\u00b0- 25\u00b0 N latitude in July, where it is positioned in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and the south-west monsoons blow from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. In this position, the ITCZ is referred to be the Monsoon Trough [highest rainfall].\nBecause of the seasonal change of the ITCZ, the notion of Northern Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (NITCZ) in summer (July \u2013 rainy season) and Southern Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (SITCZ) in winter has emerged (Jan \u2013 dry season).\nThe NITCZ is the cloud and rainfall zone that affects India.\n\nAlso Read: Seasons in India \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nOnset of the Monsoon\nIn April and May, when the sun shines vertically over the Tropic of Cancer, the huge continent to the north of the Indian Ocean gets exceedingly hot.\nThis causes an intense low-pressure system to build in the northwestern section of the subcontinent.\nBecause the pressure in the Indian Ocean to the south of the landmass is high due to the slow heating of water, the low-pressure cell attracts southeast trades over the Equator.\nThese factors help the ITCZ to move northward.\nThe southwest monsoon can be considered as a continuation of the southeast trades deflected towards the Indian subcontinent after crossing the Equator.\nThese winds cross the Equator between 40\u00b0E and 60\u00b0E longitudes.\nThe southwest monsoon arrives on the Kerala coast on June 1st and sweeps fast through Mumbai and Kolkata from June 10th to June 13th.\nBy mid-July, the southwest monsoon has engulfed the whole subcontinent.\nThe Southwest Monsoon Season\nThe Rainy Season is from June to September.\nLow-pressure conditions in the northwest plains have gotten even more extreme as a result of the quick rise in temperature in May.\nBy early June, they are strong enough to attract Southern Hemisphere trade winds from the Indian Ocean.\nThese southeast trade winds traverse the equator, entering the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea before becoming entangled in the air circulation over India.\nAs they move through the equatorial warm currents, they bring a lot of moisture with them.\nAfter passing through the equator, they head southwest. This is what the southwest monsoons are called.\nBURSTS OF THE SOUTHWEST MONSOON\nDuring the southwest monsoon season, the rain begins suddenly.\nThe first rain has a substantial cooling effect on the temperature.\nThe term \u201cmonsoon break\u201d or \u201cburst\u201d refers to the abrupt onset of moisture-laden winds accompanied by strong thunder and lightning.\nThe monsoon may come in the first week of June in coastal parts of Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra, and in the first week of July in the interior.\nThe daily temperature drops by 5\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C between mid-June and mid-July.\nAs these winds approach the land, the relief and thermal low pressure over northwest India change their southwesterly course.\nNorth-East Monsoon\nThe northeast monsoon makes its way into India from the northeast.\nWith this type of monsoon, the wind blows from the sea to the land.\nThe monsoon winds transport moisture from the Indian Ocean.\nFrom October through December, the northeast monsoon is limited to south India, bringing rain to Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, Yanam, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Mahe, and south interior Karnataka.\nThe related rainfall, often known as the winter monsoon, is caused by low-pressure systems, depressions, and cyclones.\nThis is Tamil Nadu\u2019s main rainy season, with 48% (447.4mm) of the state\u2019s annual rainfall falling during these three months.\nSeason of Retreating Monsoon\nMonsoons are known to disappear between October and November.\nThe southwest monsoon weakens around the end of September as the Ganga plain\u2019s low-pressure trough begins to travel southward in reaction to the sun\u2019s southward march.\nThe monsoon has left western Rajasthan by the first week of September.\nIt will have passed across Rajasthan, Gujarat, the Western Ganga plain, and the Central Highlands by the end of the month.\nEFFECTS CAUSED BY RETREATING MONSOONS\nThese tropical cyclones pose a significant risk.\nThe thickly populated deltas of the Godavari, Krishna, and Kaveri rivers are their favoured targets.\nEvery year, devastating cyclones wreak havoc on this region.\nCyclonic storms have also slammed the shores of West Bengal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.\nThe majority of the rainfall on the Coromandel coast is caused by these depressions and cyclones.\nSuch cyclonic storms are less common in the Arabian Sea.\nImportance of the Indian Monsoon\nBecause about 60% of India\u2019s net arable land lacks irrigation, the monsoon is crucial for agriculture.\nThe monsoon is responsible for over 70% of India\u2019s annual rainfall and influences the yield of a wide range of cereals and pulses, including rice, wheat, and sugarcane.\nAgriculture employs more than half of India\u2019s people, and monsoon rains have a direct impact on their wages and well-being.\nAgriculture contributes to more than 15% of India\u2019s GDP, hence crop failure due to a lack of rain has a negative impact on the economy.\nMonsoonal rainfall helps with water storage for irrigation, electricity generation, and drinking.\nConclusion\n\nThe effect of the monsoon on local weather varies depending on location. Some areas may have a bit more or less rain. Semi-deserts in other areas are turned into beautiful green grasslands that support a varied range of flora and crops. The Indian Monsoon converts enormous areas of India from semi-desert to lush greenery. Farmers in regions like this must have the proper timing for spreading seeds on the fields since it is vital to use all of the available rain to grow crops.\n\nRead:\u00a0Impact of climate change on Indian monsoon\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Current research on Himalayan glaciers demonstrates that topography and climate play a major role in determining the variations in retreat rate and mass balance in various mountain range sections. Read here to learn about the causes, effects, and solutions for the glacial retreat.\n\nMassive amounts of ice that are moving slowly downhill make up the glaciers. A glacier develops anywhere snow falls faster than it melts. As melting overcomes accretion, the glacier retreats, resulting in the glacier tongue\u2019s terminal edge terminating at progressively higher altitudes.\n\nThe bulk of mountain (alpine) glaciers on Earth have been retreating since about 1850. While the vast ice-sheet glaciers along the coasts of Greenland and the West Antarctic Peninsula have accelerated their flow to the sea, Alpine glaciers have recently accelerated their retreat.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGlacial retreat\nCauses of glacial retreat\nImpact of glacial melting and retreat\nWay forward\nGlacial retreat\n\nToday, about 10% of the land area on Earth is covered with glacial ice. Almost 90% is in Antarctica, while the remaining 10% is in the Greenland ice cap.\n\nA glacier diminishing or retreating in size over time as a result of less ice accumulating on it or more ice melting is referred to as glacial retreat.\n\nThe vast majority of instances of rapid glacial retreat are very certainly the result of anthropogenic activities leading to global climate change.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSince the turn of the 20th century, several glaciers throughout the world have been melting swiftly. Human activity is the cause of this phenomenon.\n\nThe ages of glaciers throughout the world range from hundreds to thousands of years, and they provide a historical record of climatic change. Their research offers important details on how rapidly and to what degree the earth is warming.\n\nThe present rate of glacier retreat is a challenge for glacier monitoring in three ways:\n\nFirst, the rapid glacier retreat with the disintegration of large glaciers into smaller ones, the formation of periglacial lakes, and the increased debris cover make it difficult to keep up length change and mass balance measurements.\nSecond, major parts of the monitoring systematics were developed for glaciers closer to balance as they appear to be now. The rapid melting has made it difficult to capture and quantify the extremes.\nThird, all the above-mentioned processes need thorough and consistent documentation, which has to be developed and coordinated in real-time at national and international levels.\n\nAs glaciers retreat, they expose landscapes that were only recently covered by ice. This provides an excellent opportunity to explore and understand how glacial landforms and sediments are formed during glacier recessions.\n\nCauses of glacial retreat\n\nThe phenomena of glacial retreat and meting are mostly the results of human activity.\n\nIn particular, since the industrial revolution, emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide have increased temperatures, even more near the poles, and as a result, glaciers are quickly melting, calving off into the sea, and retreating on land.\n\nGlobal warming: Greenhouse gases, which affect the warming trend by trapping heat in the atmosphere, have been produced as a result of the burning of fossil fuels. More glaciers melt and recede as temperatures increase, exposing the land underneath.\n\nClimate change: Statistics predict that shortly, glacier loss will be at an all-time high. The faster melting of glaciers is a result of temperature increases brought on by global warming. Studies show that the main cause of glacier retreat is human-caused global warming.\n\nOil and gas extraction: During the process of extracting oil and gas, methane, the main component of natural gas, is also released. The gas also traps heat more efficiently than carbon dioxide, accelerating global warming, and making it more detrimental to the environment.\n\nSolar radiation: The most important of these is the quantity of solar energy that touches the ice, which has an impact on glacier melting and receding. Glaciers lose mass as a result of increased radiation-induced melting.\n\nGlacial till: The unsorted mass of material known as glacial till is gathered by moving glaciers and can include everything from silt to big boulders. The ice is protected by boulders while the weaker ice around it melts.\n\nEven if we significantly curb emissions in the coming decades, more than a third of the world\u2019s remaining glaciers will melt before the year 2100. When it comes to sea ice, 95% of the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic is already gone.\n\nImpact of glacial melting and retreat\n\nThe glacial retreat can have a variety of important environmental effects, such as altered local ecosystems, altered water supply, and a higher risk of natural catastrophes like landslides and floods.\n\nRising sea level and coastal erosion: When Sea levels rise due to melting glaciers, more frequent and more powerful coastal storms like hurricanes and typhoons are produced. This increases coastal erosion and storm surge.\n\nThe Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets in particular are the main causes of the rise in sea levels worldwide.\n\nWeather patterns: As this ice melts, darker patches of the ocean start to emerge, eliminating the effect that previously cooled the poles, creating warmer air temperatures and in turn disrupting normal patterns of ocean circulation.\n\nResearch shows the polar vortex is appearing outside of the Arctic more frequently because of changes to the jet stream, caused by a combination of warming air and ocean temperatures in the Arctic and the tropics.\n\nFishing industries: Industries that thrive on vibrant fisheries will be affected as warmer waters change where and when fish spawn.\n\nCoastal communities will continue to face billion-dollar disaster recovery bills as flooding becomes more frequent and storms become more intense.\n\nWildlife: In the Arctic, as sea ice melts, wildlife like walruses are losing their home and polar bears are spending more time on land, causing higher rates of conflict between people and bears.\n\nFresh water scarcity: The scarcity of fresh water must be taken into account. There is less water accessible for human usage, whether it is for drinking, hydroelectricity production, or agriculture, the less ice there is.\n\nThreat of coral reefs: To thrive through the process of photosynthesis, coral reefs need sunshine. Due to glaciers melting or retreating, rising sea levels prevent corals from receiving adequate sunlight.\n\nRapid glacial melt in Antarctica and Greenland also influences ocean currents, as massive amounts of very cold glacial-melt water entering warmer ocean waters are slowing ocean currents. And as ice on land melts, sea levels will continue to rise.\n\nWay forward\n\nBy acting as massive mirrors that reflect sunlight from the Earth\u2019s surface into the atmosphere and regulate the planet\u2019s temperature, glaciers play a significant part in preventing global warming. People throughout the world depend on the rivers that are created by runoff from glacial melting.\n\nIt\u2019s important to be aware of the consequences of fossil fuel usage. The level of thermal energy in the environment rises as a result of the widespread use of fossil fuels. Over usage of coal and oil has an annual impact on the artificial atmosphere in addition to depleting these limited resources.\n\nResearch and development for mitigating and preventing further melting of glaciers should be given credence. Science along with other environmental strategies can help mitigate the catastrophe.\n\nSimilarly, alternate energy sources such as solar, wind, and other green sources should be given more promotion.\n\nGlaciers are important as they provide a scientific record of how climate has changed over time. Through their study, we gain valuable information about the extent to which the planet is rapidly warming. They provide scientists with a record of how climate has changed over time.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

It is typically well-served by transportation routes, such as rail, and may not be homogenous, meaning that there may be a variety of unrelated manufacturing kinds in a single location.

Chaudhry (1976), and the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) also identified the industrial areas of India (1971, 1982).\nAlfred Marshall first used the term \u201cindustrial district\u201d to refer to a few features of the industrial organisation of countries.

The industrial areas of India, as defined by Prof. R.L. Singh, are briefly described as follows:\n\nThe Mumbai-Pune Industrial Region\nThe nation\u2019s most significant manufacturing area is located here. Following the arrival of the British in India, who created the Mumbai seaport, the area began to grow.\nThe sea path between India and Europe was significantly condensed after the Suez Canal\u2019s opening in 1869.\nThis industrial area\u2019s growth is closely related to India\u2019s history of progress in the cotton textile industry.\nThe growth of this industrial area was primarily influenced by the humid climate, natural port facilities, availability of hydropower, skilled labour, and a vast hinterland producing cotton.\nOnly the larger Mumbai area has more than 8000 registered factories, 350 of which are cotton textile factories.\nThe region\u2019s other industries include those that produce engineering products, chemicals, food processing, leather goods, pharmaceuticals, and films. The majority of the manufacturing in Mumbai is of light-textured, fine, and ultrafine cotton fabrics. In this region, the industrial industry employs over 15 lakh people.\nPune is the second-largest manufacturing hub in the area. More than 1200 recognised factories are there. Metallurgical, chemical, engineering, and automotive products are produced by its industries. Two companies in Pune build scooters and mopeds.\nAmbarnath, Andheri, Bhandup, Ghatkopar, Hadapsar, Jogeshwari, Kalyan, Kirkee, Kolhapur, Kurla, Nashik, Sholapur, Thane, Trombay, Ulhasnagar, and Vikroli are some of the other manufacturing hubs in this area in addition to Mumbai and Pune.\nThis industrial region has almost reached the saturation level. Some of the important problems of this industrial region are:\nInadequate supply of power\nObsolete and outdated machinery\nHigh cost of land and high rent of commercial space\nLabor unrest\nIncreasing regionalism\nHigh rate of crime\nIncreasing environment pollution\nThis area was negatively impacted by the country\u2019s 1947 division because 81% of the total irrigated cotton area used to produce long-staple cotton was given to Pakistan. Mumbai, the hub of this industrial area, is currently constrained by a lack of room for industry growth. To reduce congestion, businesses must be spread out.\nThe Kolkata-Hugli Industrial Region\nThe Hugh River runs alongside the manufacturing area of Kolkata-Hugli.\nIn the western Midnapur region, industries have also grown. The Hugli River provided the ideal location for the construction of an inland river port as the centre of the Hugli industrial area.\nThe proximity of coal mines (Raniganj and Jharia), the availability of agro-raw materials (jute, indigo, and tea), an abundance of water, affordable labor, and export facilities were the primary determinants of this industrial region\u2019s rapid expansion.\nIn addition, Calcutta served as British India\u2019s capital from 1773 to 1911. Since Kolkata is the country\u2019s capital, many industrialists chose to base their businesses here.\nIn this area, more than 10,000 registered industrial factories are employing more than 20 lakh people.\nJute, silk, cotton textiles, engineering, electrical products, automobiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, transport equipment, leather footwear, iron and steel and food processing, light machinery, locomotives, iron and steel, and spare parts for various types of machines are all produced by this belt.\nNaihati, Bhatpara, Shamnagar, Krishnanagar, Serampore, Titagarh, Rishra, Kolkata, Haora, and Budge are the major industrial cities and towns in this area.\nThe main problems of this industrial region are:\nThe paucity of space and traffic jams\nShortage of drinking water, insanitation, and lack of infrastructural amenities.\nSilting of the Hugli river resulting in the silting of Kolkata port\nObsolete machinery\nNaxalites movement and political unrest\nStrikes and lockouts\nShortage of power supply\nThe West Bengali government is following a liberalization policy and asking both domestic and foreign business owners to invest in the area to address these issues. In recent years, some advancements have been achieved in this direction.\nThe Ahmadabad -Vadodara Industrial Region\nThe third-largest industrial area in the nation is located here.\nThe proximity of petroleum, thermal, hydel (Ukai project), and nuclear power plants, as well as the availability of cheap land, cheap skilled and unskilled labor, and port facilities, all contributed to the growth of this industrial area (Kakrapara).\nIn this area, over 11 thousand registered factories are employing over 15 lakh people.\nIt is the country\u2019s second-largest center for the manufacturing of cotton textiles.\nIt specializes in engineering products, pharmaceuticals, and chemical sectors.\nVadodara is a significant hub for petroleum and woolen textile products.\nThe cutting of diamonds and silk textiles is well-known in Surat. Anand, Ankleshwar Bhavnagar, Bharuch, Godhra,\nJamnagar, Kalol, Kheda, Rajkot, and Surendernagar are some of the area\u2019s other significant manufacturing hubs.\nSome of the major issues in the area include a lack of decent cotton and a lack of water. The investment in businesses in this area has suffered recently as a result of racial tension.\nThe Madurai-Coimbatore-Bangalore Industrial Region\nIt is a significant industrial center that spans the states of Tamil Nadu and the southern regions of Karnataka, and it made significant strides after freedom.\nThe majority of the nation\u2019s cotton is produced in this location.\nThe favorable climate, well-behaved skilled and unskilled labor, consistent power supply (from the Mettur, Papanasam, Pykara, Savitri, and Sivasamudram power plants), and proximity to the seaports of Chennai, Kochi, Mangalore, and Tuticorin have all contributed to the industrial region\u2019s rapid growth.\nThe textile industry employs about 60% of all employees, followed by engineering (18%) and food processing (about 12%).\nThe Chotanagpur Industrial Region\nJharkhand, Odisha, Southern Bihar, and western West Bengal make up this industrial area.\nIt is frequently referred to as the \u201cRuhr of India\u201d due to the significant concentration of the iron and steel sector.\nMinerals, both solid and non-metallic, and fossil fuels are abundant in this area. The Damodar Valley Company provides power. The provinces of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are huge sources of cheap labour.\nAsansol, Bokaro, Burnpur, Durgapur, Kulti, Jamshedpur, and Raurkela are the principal Iron and Steel-producing cities in the area. Other significant manufacturing hubs in the area include Ramgarh and Bhurkunda for the glass industry, Ranchi for HMT, Chittranjan for locomotives, Sindri for fertilizer, and Chittranjan for locomotives.\nThe region\u2019s major issues are a lack of power supply and political unrest like that brought on by Naxalites. Many of the investors in this area have shied away due to labor strife.\nThe Agra-Delhi-Kalka-Saharanpur Industrial Region\nThe principal industrial hubs are located in Agra (textiles, tourism), Ambala (scientific instruments), Chandigarh (electronic and strategic goods), Delhi (textile, chemical, drugs, pharmaceutical, light machine, electronic goods, food processing), Faridabad (engineering), Ghaziabad (synthetic fiber, chemicals, electronics, pharmaceuticals, agricultural equipment, iron & steel, cycle tyre, and tubes), Gurgaon (automobiles), Kalka (paper, wood-work, sugar, textile, and food-processing).\nThe major issues in this area are the high cost of land, the traffic, and the high crime rate.\nVishakhapatnam-Guntur Region\nThis industrial region extends from the Vishakhapatnam district to Kurnool and Prakasam districts in the south. The industrial development of this region hinges upon Vishakhapatnam and Machilipatnam ports and developed agriculture and rich reserves of minerals in their hinterlands.\nCoalfields of the Godavari basin provide energy. The shipbuilding industry was started at Vishakhapatnam in 1941. Petroleum refineries based on imported petroleum facilitated the growth of several petrochemical industries.\nSugar, textile, jute, paper, fertilizer, cement, aluminum, and light engineering are the principal industries of this region. Important industrial centres are Vishakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Vijaynagar, Rajahmundry, Guntur, Eluru and Kurnool\nKollam-Thiruvananthapuram Region\nThis industrial region is spread over Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alwaye, Ernakulam, and Alappuzha districts. Plantation agriculture and hydropower provide an industrial base to this region.\nLocated far away from the mineral belt of the country, agricultural products processing and market-oriented light industries predominate the region.\nAmong them, cotton textile, sugar, rubber, matchbox, glass, chemical fertilizer and fish-based industries are important. Food processing, paper, coconut coir products, aluminium, and cement industries are also significant.\nThe main industries of this region are coconut oil extraction, rice milling, fish packing, paper, coir-matting, ship-building (Kochi), petroleum refining (Kochi), and chemical and electronic goods.\nImportant industrial centres are Kollam, Tiruvanantapuram, Alluva, Kocchi, Alappuzha, and Punalur.\nThe Minor Industrial Areas of India\n\nApart from the industrial regions described there are 13 minor emerging industrial regions in the country.\n\nAmbala- Amritsar\nJaipur- Ajmer\nIndore- Dewas- Ujjain\nSaharampur-Muzaffarnagar- Bijnor\nKolhapur- South Kannada\nNorthern Malabar\nMiddle Malabar\nAdilabad \u2013 Nizamabad\nPrayag- Varanasi- Mirzapur\nBhojpur- Munger\nDurga- Raipur\nBilaspur- Korba\nBrahmaputra valley\n\nApart from the above Minor Industrial areas, Some other famous Industrial areas in India are listed below.\n\nKanpur-Lucknow Industrial Areas: This Industrial Region is known for cotton, woolen, and jute textiles, leather goods, fertilizers, chemicals, drugs, pharmaceuticals, electric goods, and light machinery.\nAssam valley Industrial Areas:\u00a0This region has the industries of petrochemical, jute and silk textiles, tea-processing industry, paper, plywood, match, and food processing industries.\u00a0Important industrial centres are Bongaigaon, Dlbrygarh, Digboi, Guwahati, Noonmati and Tipsukia.\nDarjeeling-Siliguri Industrial Areas: This region is known for the production of the tea processing industry and tourism.\nNorth Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh Industrial Areas: This Industrial Region is known for sugar, cement, glass, jute, fertilizers, locomotive, paper, and food processing are main industries.

Read further to know more.\n\nPort infrastructure is critical to the success of any country. The length of India\u2019s coastline is roughly 7,500 kilometres. In terms of volume and value, ports handle nearly 95% and 70%, respectively, of India\u2019s exports. Iron ore, coal, crude petroleum, and other vital items are imported via the sea route.\n\nA nation\u2019s development is heavily reliant on its ports. Compared to other routes of transportation, ports are the most efficient in terms of price, volume, and ease of use.\n\nThe Indian government is an important supporter of the port industry\u2019s development. It has created an automatic path to 100% FDI for port and harbour construction and maintenance projects. It has also made it easier for firms who build, operate, and maintain ports, inland waterways, and inland ports to benefit from a 10-year tax relief.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPort administration in India\nMajor\u00a0 ports\nMinor ports\nPort classifications based on cargo handled\nPort classifications based on location\nService port model versus the Landlord port model\nMajor ports of India\nList of Important Indian Ports\nPorts on Western Coast\nKochi (Cochin) Port\nKolkata Port\nKandla Port\nMangalore Port\nPort of Mormugao\nMumbai Port Trust\nJawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT)\n\u00a0Vadhavan Port\nPorts on the Eastern coast\nChennai Port\nEnnore Port (Kamarajar Port Ltd.)\nParadip Port\nTuticorin Port\nVisakhapatnam\nPort Blair\nIn news\nConclusion\nPort administration in India\n\nMajor and minor ports are the two types of ports in India. Major ports are owned and operated by the Central Government, while minor ports are owned and operated by state governments. India has 205 designated minor and intermediate ports that handle a significant amount of business in addition to 13 major seaports (12 government-owned and one private).\n\nMajor\u00a0 ports\n\nMajor ports are included in the Union list of the Indian Constitution and are administered under the Indian Ports Act of 1908 and the Major Port Trust Act of 1963. Each major port is overseen by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Government of India. Port development, management, and operations are among their tasks.\n\nMinor ports\n\nMinor ports, such as those in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, are governed by the port department or, if one exists, the State Maritime Board. State marine boards perform similar functions to port trusts and have tariff-setting authority. They also work to attract private investment through concession contracts, incentives, exclusive rights, and land acquisition.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPort classifications based on cargo handled\n\nPort classifications based on cargo handled are Commercial ports, Industrial ports, and Comprehensive Ports.\n\nIndustrial ports specialise in bulk items such as grain, sugar, minerals, oil, chemicals, and similar materials.\nCommercial ports handle general cargo, such as packaged goods and manufactured things, as well as passenger traffic.\nComprehensive ports handle massive amounts of bulk and general cargo. The bulk of the world\u2019s major ports is comprehensive ports.\nPort classifications based on location\nInterior ports are those that are not on the coast. They are connected to the sea by a river or canal. These ports can be approached by flat-bottomed ships and barges. Kolkata, for example, is situated on the Hoogli River.\nOut Ports: Deep-water ports that are located outside of the main ports. These ports help the parent ports by receiving ships that are too large to enter the parent ports.\nService port model versus the Landlord port model\nThe service port model: The port authority owns the land as well as all available equipment (both fixed and mobile) and performs all regulatory and port activities under the service port model.\nThe landlord port model: The landlord port concept involves a publicly controlled port body acting as both a regulator and a landlord, while private firms oversee port operations, notably cargo handling. The port is owned by the port authority, but the infrastructure is leased to private businesses that build and maintain their own superstructure as well as install their own cargo handling equipment.\nMajor ports of India\n\nAll Indian ports are located in nine coastal states: Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat, West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe country\u2019s thirteen major ports handle a large volume of container and cargo traffic.\nMumbai is India\u2019s largest natural port.\nAs you are aware, the Indian government has a federal structure, and maritime transit is to be controlled by both the Central and State governments, according to the Indian constitution.\nWhile the central government\u2019s shipping ministry is in charge of the major ports, the minor and intermediate ports are managed by the respective departments or ministries in the nine coastal states: Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal.\n\nSix of India\u2019s 13 major ports are located on the western coast. The other six ports are on the east coast, with one on the Andaman\u00a0Nicobar Islands in Port Blair.\n\nAlso Read: Maritime India Vision 2030 \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nList of Important Indian Ports\n\nThe

The Himalayan mountain range has grown in the following ways:\n\nThe Oligocene period saw the formation of the Great Himalayas.\nThe Miocene era saw the formation of the Lesser Himalayas.\nThe Pliocene and Upper Pliocene epochs saw the formation of shiwaliks.\nEocene and Oligocene-era structures in Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Assam contain mineral oil.\nThe Tertiary epoch has been divided into four temporal sections: the Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene.\n\nAlso Read: Exogenic Forces: Classification \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nRocks of the Quarternary System\n\nThese rocks can be found in the Ganges and Indus River plains.\n\nThe Pleistocene and Holocene epochs are separated temporally into two portions that make up the Quarternary epoch.\nThe term \u201cBangar\u201d refers to an old alluvial soil that was produced during the Upper and Middle Pleistocene.\nAt the conclusion of the Pleistocene epoch, alluvial soil production started, and it is currently ongoing in the current Holocene epoch. It is called \u201ckhadar.\u201d\nThe valley in Kashmir was created during the Pleistocene epoch.\nA lake once occupied this valley. The current form (valley), known as \u201ckareva,\u201d was created as a result of the constant deposition of the earth.\nThe Thar Desert is where Pleistocene-era deposits can be discovered. The ocean once contained the \u201cRann of Kachchh.\u201d In the Pleistocene and Holocene eras, sedimentary sediments filled it.\nConclusion\n\nIndia\u2019s geology history exhibited a distinctive and varied nature. Classification of Indian rocks is based on the geological structure of our country which includes the physical and chemical properties. Rocks from various geologic eras can be found in different parts of India. The Pangaean supercontinent once included the Indian Craton. The Himalayan mountain range was created after the Gondwanaland craton broke (225 million years ago) and drifted towards the Eurasian craton (65 my ago).\n\nThe Indo- Ganga- Brahmaputra plain region formed in the upper Pliocene and Pleistocene eras following a series of vast spared alluvial plains in the Outer Himalayas. As a result, different regions of India have rocks that represent practically every sort of geological structure from various geologic eras.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Read further to know more.\n\nA mountain is a landform that sharply protrudes above its surroundings and has notable local relief, steep slopes, and a tiny peak region. It\u2019s common knowledge that mountains are bigger than hills.\n\nNearly 27% of the world\u2019s land surface is covered by mountains. 80% of the planet\u2019s fresh surface water comes from mountans.\n\nMountains can be divided into a wide variety of categories according to, their time of origin, their height and how they formed.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nClassification on the Basis of

Mode of Origin\n\nThese were created as a result of the tectonic plates colliding and bending as a result of large-scale plate movements.\n\nThere are further classified into :\n\nBlock mountains\nFold mountains\nDome mountains\nMountains of Accumulations\nCircum-erosional/Relict\nBlock Mountains\n\nBlock Mountains are also formed by the internal or endogenic earth movements which cause the\u00a0force of tension\u00a0and faulting.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2)

faults results in the formation of Block Mountains.\n\nA block mountain is also called a Horst\u00a0and the rift valley formed as a result of faulting is called\u00a0Graben.\n\nHigher blocks are referred to as horsts, and troughs as grabens.\n\nExamples include the Rhila Rhodope Mountain Range, Satpura Range, Sierra Nevada Range, and Vindhya Range.\n\nFold Mountains\n\nLarge-scale tectonic plate collisions cause folding and subduction of land, which leads to the formation of fold mountains.\n\nThey are formed due to the\u00a0force of compression arising from endogenic\u00a0or internal forces.\n\nSynclines\u00a0(trough) and\u00a0anticlines (crest) are part of the Fold Mountains.\n\nThe Himalayas, Rockies, Andes, Balkan, Jura Mountains, and Zagros are the most prominent fold mountains of the world.\n\nRocks that formed under intense pressure and at low temperatures, such as sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, make up the majority of fold mountains.\n\nMany fold mountains develop when a layer of ductile minerals, like salt, is underlain.\n\nMountains Dome\n\nThese are created when the top sedimentary rock layers are forced upward by the hot, molten material (magma) emerging from the Earth\u2019s mantle into the crust.\n\nThey consequently take the shape of a \u201cdome.\u201d\n\nMagma rarely reaches the Earth\u2019s surface here, unlike a volcano.\n\nMountains of Accumulations (Volcanic Mountains)\n\nThe accumulation of volcanic material creates volcanoes, sometimes referred to as Mountains of Accumulations.\n\nThe thrown-out volcanic debris settles in the form of a mountain range around the crater.\n\nA flatter cone with a lower elevation and a softer slope results from thin, simple-composition lava spreading across a vast area.\n\nIf the composition is thick and acidic, the result will be a little volcanic cone that protrudes abruptly.\n\nSometimes the lava is sent out along with ash.\n\nMount Mauna Loa on the Hawaiian Island of Hawaii, Mount Popa in Myanmar, and Fujiyama in Japan are examples of it.\n\nCircum-erosional/ Relict /Residual Mountains\n\nThese are the exposed remains of ancient fold mountains caused to denudation (strip of covering).\n\nThese can also develop from plateaus that have been eroded into hills and valleys by rivers.\n\nThese can be found in India on hills like the Nilgiri, Palkonda, Parasnath, and Rajmahal, as well as on mountains like the Aravalli, Vindhya, and Satpura.\n\nClassification on the Basis of Period of Origin\n\nNine orogenic movements have taken occurred altogether to date.\n\nSome of them took place in the Precambrian era, between 600 and 3,500 million years ago.\n\nThe three most recent orogenies are the Caledonian, Hercynian, and Alpine.\n\nPre-Cambrian Mountains\n\nThe Precambrian era, which lasted more than 4 billion years, is when these mountains first appeared.\n\nThe rocks have been metamorphosed, denuded, and uplifted.\n\nAs a result, the relics resemble residual mountains.\n\nAlgoman and the Laurentian mountains are two examples of this.\n\nCaledonian Mountain\n\nMassive orogenic activities and associated tectonic movements throughout the late Silurian and early Devonian periods led to the formation of the Caledonian Mountains, approximately 430 million years to 380 million years ago.\n\nExamples include the Appalachians, Aravallis, Mahadeo, and others.\n\nHercynian Mountains\n\nThe Carboniferous and Permian periods are when these mountains first appeared in Europe, approximately 340 million years and 225 million years ago.\n\nThe Altai, Asia\u2019s Tien Shan, The Vosges, Black Forest Mountains, and the Ural Mountains are only a few examples of them.\n\nAlpine Mountains\n\nThe Alps, which span over 1,200 kilometres across Eight Alpine nations\u2014France, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia\u2014are the highest and broadest mountain range system in all of Europe.\n\nThese were created by the collision of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates tens of millions of years ago.\n\nExtreme shortening brought on by this event caused marine sedimentary materials to shove and fold into high peaks like the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc.\n\nClassification on the Basis of Height\n\nOn the basis of height, mountains can be classified as:\n\nLow Mountains\n\nLow mountains are those that are less than 700 metres high.\n\nMount Chimneytop in Tennessee, USA is an example..\n\nRough Mountains\n\nBetween 1000 and 1500 metres high is called Rough Mountains.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Mount Donna Buang is an excellent example of this.\n\nRugged Mountains\n\nMountains that are rough range in height from 1500 to 2000 metres.\n\nIndia\u2019s Agastya Mala is an illustration of a rugged mountain.\n\nHigh Mountains\n\nThe high mountains, as their name implies, are often higher than 2000 metres.\n\nKanchenjunga is a typical example for this.\n\nClassification on the Basis of Location\n\nOn the basis of location, mountains can be classified as:\n\nCoastal Mountains\n\nCoastal refers to everything that is in the water or on land that is close to the coast. As the name suggests, coastal mountains are ones that are close to a coastline.\n\nExamples include the Rocky, Appalachians, The Alpine\u00a0 Ranges, The Western Ghats, and The Eastern Ghats.\n\nInland Mountains\n\nThe mountains that are landlocked are known as inland mountains.\n\nThey make up the majority of the mountains we come across.\n\nExamples include The Vosges and The Black Forest in Europe, The Kunlun, Tienshan, and Altai ranges in Asia, and The Urals in Russia.\n\nThe Aravallis, Himalayas, and Satpura are a few examples of this.\n\nOceanic Mountains\n\nOceanic mountains are those that are found on oceanic and continental shelves.\n\nIf mountains were measured from the ocean floor, Mauna Kea (9140 m) would be the highest peak. It is a dormant volcano in the volcanic chain of Hawaii.\n\nSignificance of Mountains\n\nFollowing are the significance of mountains:\n\n\u00a0A storehouse of natural resources\n\nLarge resources of minerals like petroleum, coal, and limestone are found in mountains. The mountains are the main source of timber, lac, medical herbs, etc.\n\nAct as Water Towers\n\nMountains are referred to as \u201cwater towers\u201d because they act as significant headwaters for several rivers and other freshwater sources.\n\nSnowmelt produces streamflow, which eventually finds its way into streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans, where it becomes fresh water. Rehydrating aquifers is another use for this meltwater.\n\nSource of Freshwater\n\nPerennial rivers, which originate in the snow- or rain-covered mountains, are regarded as a crucial source of water. They also perform a variety of functions, including providing water for local residents and aiding with agriculture.\n\nFormation of Fertile plain\n\nWhen rivers emerge from high mountains, they convey water to lower valleys along with silt. This is in charge of creating fertile plains and supporting operations related to agriculture.\n\nControl Speed of Wind\n\nThey aid in reducing the wind\u2019s velocity. The wind blows up the steep slopes, carrying air and clouds with it. As the air pressure keeping them in increases, warm, moist air masses travel up and over a mountain swell.\n\nNatural Political Frontiers\n\nThe mountains can also act as natural boundaries between the two countries. They have a prominent role in protecting the country from external threats.\n\nEffects on Climate\n\nThey serve as a climatic divide between two adjoining regions. The mountains cause orogenic rainfalls, diversion, and blocking of cold winds, etc.\n\nMajor Tourist Destination\n\nThe climate, pure air, distinctive flora and fauna, scenic beauty, local culture, history, and tradition, as well as the opportunity to experience snow and engage in winter sports, are just a few of the factors that make mountain regions attract tourists.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne-fifth of the world\u2019s area is made up of mountains, and at least one-tenth of all people live there. 26.5 per cent of the continental land area of the earth is made up of mountain ranges. 197 of the 237 countries in the world have mountains. In terms of biodiversity, water, clean air, research, cultural variation, recreation, landscape, and spiritual aspects, mountains are highly valued.\n\nTo get more Geography Notes Click Here\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S",

Lithium is considered a crucial component for the production of rechargeable batteries, which are used in a variety of electronic devices, including smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles. Read here to know more about the element and significance of the discovery.\n\nThe Geological Survey of India (GSI) has established \u201cinferred\u201d lithium resources of 5.9 million tonnes in the Salal-Haimana area of the Reasi District of Jammu and Kashmir. These resources have been established as part of the \u201cReasi Sersandu-Kherikot-Rahotkot-Darabi\u201d mineral block, where prospecting has been ongoing since 2021-22.\n\nThe recent discovery of this large deposit of metal in India could potentially help the country to meet its domestic demand for the metal, which has been increasing in recent years due to the growing popularity of electronic devices and electric vehicles.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLithium\nApplications of Li metal\nSide-effects of lithium mining\nGlobal lithium reserves\nLithium Reserves in India\nSignificance of lithium deposits in India\nWay forward\nLithium\n\nThe chemical element lithium has the chemical symbol Li and atomic number 3 and is derived from the Greek word lithos, meaning stone.\n\nIt is a delicate, white-silver alkali metal.\nIt is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element under typical conditions.\nAs with all alkali metals, Li must be stored under a vacuum, in an inert atmosphere, or an inert liquid such as mineral oil or pure kerosene.\nIt has a shiny sheen when cut, but damp air quickly corrodes it to a dull silvery grey, then a black patina.\nIt never occurs freely in nature, but only in (usually ionic) compounds, such as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of Li.\nDue to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines.\nLi metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\n\nIn trace levels, Li is found in biological systems; its roles remain unknown. In the treatment of mental illnesses including bipolar disorder, Li salts have shown promise as a mood stabilizer and antidepressant.\n\nMany industrial products use lithium and its compounds, including lithium metal batteries, lithium-ion batteries, flux additives for the manufacturing of iron, steel, and aluminum, heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, and lithium-ion batteries.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMore than 75 percent of Li production is used for these purposes.\n\nApplications of Li metal\n\nLi is best known for its role in energy-storage technology.\n\nLithium-ion batteries, rechargeable and lightweight, power the most-used electronic devices on the planet, from cell phones to laptops.\nThe design of the battery laid the foundations for a wireless society.\n\nLithium-ion batteries do not just make for better electronic devices, but also allow for the storage of significant amounts of energy from renewable sources, such as solar and wind.\n\nThey are already used to power homes and commercial, industrial, and educational facilities around the world.\n\nIn addition, the batteries are what enable electric cars to operate with high autonomy.\n\nThese batteries also promote development through access to energy, because they allow a greater application of solutions with solar panels in isolated systems.\n\nSolar radiation is converted into electrical energy through photovoltaic solar panels. This energy can be connected to the electricity grid or it can be conducted through isolated systems.\nThe excess energy produced by these panels is stored in batteries for night-time use or during periods of low solar radiation.\nIn isolated islands or remote areas not connected to the power grid, it is necessary to store the energy through batteries to use it 24 hours a day.\nThe lithium battery allows that surplus to be stored more efficiently. These batteries can store between 95 and 99% of the energy generated, while those of lead-acid which is still commonly used to store solar energy, only reach up to 85%.\nWith the development of this technology, it is possible to store the energy that supplies electricity to regions that do not yet have this service.\n\nLithium is widely used in a variety of applications due to its unique chemical and physical properties. Some of the other most important uses of the element include:\n\nPharmaceuticals: It is used as a mood stabilizer in the treatment of the bipolar disorder, depression, and other mental health conditions.\nGlass and Ceramics: It is used in the production of special glass and ceramics, as it helps to reduce the melting temperature of these materials.\nAerospace and Military: It is used in the aerospace and military industries to cool the temperature-sensitive components in space vehicles and military equipment, such as radar systems and missile guidance systems.\nLubrication: It is used as an ingredient in high-temperature lubricating greases, due to its ability to withstand high temperatures and provide long-lasting lubrication.\nSide-effects of lithium mining\n\nThe common environmental side effects of lithium mining are water loss, ground destabilization, biodiversity loss, increased salinity of rivers, contaminated soil, and toxic waste.\n\nAfter the brine is pumped out from underneath the salt flat, it is left to evaporate through a series of ponds for 12-18 months, forming a mixture of potassium, magnesium, borax, and lithium salts.\nFor a tonne of lithium, up to 2 million liters of water are required. The majority of this is lost in evaporation.\n\nOther major side-effects of Lithium Mining are-\n\nPollutes Water Sources\nIncreases Carbon Dioxide Emissions\nMisuses Gallons of Water\nDepletes Fertile Land\nCauses Respiratory Problems\nCreates Unsustainable Water Table Reduction\nProduces Massive Mining Wastes\nTampers with the Water Cycle\n\nRead:\u00a0Battery waste management\n\nGlobal lithium reserves\nCourtesy: Economist.com\n\nChile, Australia, Argentina, China, US are a few of the countries in the world with the largest overall lithium reserves, regardless of their stage of development.\n\nArgentina, Bolivia, and Chile make up the \u201clithium triangle.\u201d The three countries, along with Peru, contain about 67% of proven lithium reserves and produce about half of the global supply, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nOne-third of the \u201clithium triangle\u201d in South America \u2013 which also comprises second and third-placed Argentina and Chile \u2013 Bolivia is home to the world\u2019s biggest lithium reserves.\nWith estimates of 21 million tonnes, Bolivia holds aboutone-quarterr of the entire global resource \u2013 including the world\u2019s single-biggest lithium deposit, the Salar de Uyuni salt flat, which is visible from space.\nArgentina has the world\u2019s second-largest lithium reserves, totaling around 17 million tonnes. Likeneighboringg Bolivia and Chile, these reserves are contained in vast salt flats, where the solar evaporation of brine pools is the technique used to extract it.\nThe Salar del Hombre Muerto salt flat is a notable lithium resource in Argentina.\nChile accounts for around nine million tonnes of lithium reserves. Chile has succeeded in developing a prolific mining industry for the metal \u2013 and in 2019 had by far the world\u2019s largest mine reserves, totaling 8.6 million tonnes.\nAlthough the US has the world\u2019s fourth-largest lithium reserves, measured at 6.8 million tonnes according to the US Geological Survey, production activity in the country is minimal.\nAustralia may only rank fifth on the list of largest overall reserves with 6.3 million tonnes, but it was by far the world\u2019s biggest lithium producer in 2019.\nChina is sixth-placed on the list, with overall lithium reserves estimated at 4.5 million tonnes. In 2019, the country produced 7,500 tonnes of the metal \u2013 the third-highest level worldwide.\nLithium Reserves in India\n\nThe recently discovered lithium deposit is estimated to be 5.9 million tonnes in the Salal-Haimana area of the Reasi District of Jammu & Kashmir (UT), making it one of the largest deposits of lithium in the world.\n\nEarlier, researchers at the Atomic Minerals Directorate (under India\u2019s Atomic Energy Commission) estimated lithium reserves of 14,100 tonnes in a small patch of land surveyed in Southern Karnataka\u2019s Mandya district.\n\nThe Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), a unit of the Department of Atomic Energy, has identified 1,600 tonnes of lithium resources in the Marlagalla area of Mandya district.\n\nSignificance of lithium deposits in India\n\nOne of the reasons India has been dependent on other nations for Li-Ion batteries and other EV components is the lack of lithium availability.\n\nThe latest finding of lithium reserves in J&K does come in as a new lease of life as it furthers India\u2019s desire to become self-sufficient in its energy storage needs.\nLithium is one of the key components of Li-Ion batteries and taking into consideration the financial impact of obtaining Lithium, the new discovery is significant.\n\nThe recent discovery of this sizable lithium deposit in India may be able to assist the nation in supplying its expanding domestic metal demand, which has been driven up recently by the popularity of electronic gadgets and electric vehicles.\n\nThe finding of this significant lithium deposit in India may help the nation become a significant player in the global lithium market in addition to satisfying domestic demand.\n\nLithium mining is a challenging operation that calls for hefty infrastructural and technological investments.\n\nThe government of India will need to take action to guarantee that the development of this deposit is done in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner because the environmental impact of lithium mining is a key worry.\n\nChina even though has only the 6th largest reserves, has the upper hand when it comes to manufacturing. China is estimated to have 60 percent of the world\u2019s capacity for processing and refining lithium.\n\nIndia\u2019s lithium reserves, if manufactured and refined judiciously, can potentially make it compete against China.\n\nWay forward\n\nLithium has been dubbed \u201cwhite gold\u201d for its widespread usage in items indispensable to modern-day living.\n\nThe world\u2019s lithium supply can barely keep up with its demand. A report from the International Energy Agency says that the world could face lithium shortages by 2025.\n\nLithium, nickel, and cobalt are just a few of the minerals that India now imports to satisfy its demand.\n\nIndia is making audacious moves to establish itself as a rival in the electric vehicle supply chain as the globe works to wean itself off its reliance on China for essential battery materials.\n\nIndia only has a small amount of the raw materials required to meet the domestic demand for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nTherefore, it is anticipated that the government\u2019s aspirations to enter the EV market will receive a major boost from the discovery of lithium inferred resources (G3) of 5.9 million tonnes in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

The GSI\u2019s operational and yearly programs take on importance from a national standpoint as well.\n\nGeological Survey of India\n\nGSI is headquartered in Kolkata and has six Regional offices located at Lucknow, Jaipur, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Shillong, and Kolkata and State Unit offices in almost all States of the country.\n\nPresently, the Geological Survey of India is an attached office to the Ministry of Mines.\n\nThe Charter of the Geological Survey of India outlines its functions as follows:\n\nEnable and facilitate the provision of objective, impartial, and up-to-date geological expertise and geoscientific information of all kinds, particularly for decision-making for policy, commercial, economic, and societal needs.\nSystematically document the geology and geological processes of the surface and subsurface of India and its offshore areas using the latest and most cost-effective techniques and methodologies, including geophysical and geochemical, and geological surveys.\nDevelop and continually enhance GSI\u2019s core competence in survey and mapping through continued accretion, management, coordination, and utilization of spatial databases (including those acquired through remote sensing).\nUse new and emerging computer-based technologies for the dissemination of geoscientific information and spatial data, through cooperation and collaboration with other stakeholders in the Geoinformatics\nExplore (through the ground, airborne, satellite, and marine surveys) and scientifically assess mineral, energy, and water resources for the country and facilitate their optimal exploration through proactive information dissemination.\nMaintain a leadership role in the geological field and develop partnerships with Central, State, and other institutions, to help create enhanced execution capability and capacity in the field of geology in furtherance of GSI\u2019s Vision and the objectives of this Charter.\nCoordinate geoscientific activities with stakeholders in all sectors related to geoscience to help sustainably manage our natural resources, including water.\nConduct multidisciplinary as well as fundamental Geoscientific research and studies (including geotechnical investigations, physical, chemical, and biological hazard geo-investigations, climate change geostudies, paleogeostudies, etc.).\nActively participate in international collaborative projects to improve our understanding of the earth and its ecosystems and its geology, including studies related to tectonics, global warming and climate change, and Polar studies.\nGenerally advance the cause of the geoscience by documentation, propagation, archiving, and education, including creation and management of museums, monuments and parks, archives, libraries, and other facilities for use of students, researchers, and the public.\nIn particular, constantly endeavor to popularize Geoscience at school and university levels through the production and dissemination high quality audio-visual and printed material, and through the medium of the Internet.\nAlso, hold exhibitions and special events to bring geoscientific concepts before the public.\n\nThe activities of GSI function around 5 missions and related sub-schemes:\n\nMission I \u2013 Baseline Geoscience Data generation\n\nSurvey & Mapping\n\nSpecialized Thematic Mapping, Geochemical Mapping, Geophysical Mapping, Systematic Geological Mapping, Airborne and Marine Surveys.\n\nMission II \u2013 Natural Resources Assessment\n\nMineral Exploration\n\nExploration for coal (including lignite), Ferrous, non-ferrous, Precious, and Strategic and Industrial minerals.\n\nMission III \u2013 Geoinformatics\n\nInformation/ Dissemination\n\nMap compilation and publication on various earth science subjects, Information Technology, GSI portal\n\nMission IV \u2013 Fundamental & Multidisciplinary Geosciences and Special studies\n\nSpecialized Investigation\n\nGeotechnical, environmental, landslide studies, earthquake geology, seismology, glacial, geothermal, and desert geological studies.\n\nResearch & Development\n\nResearch work on fundamental geoscience and Arctic and Antarctic studies.\n\nMission V \u2013 Training & Capacity building\n\nHuman Resource Development\n\nTraining\nSignificance of the geological survey\n\nHistorically, surveys were used to understand the processes at the interfaces between the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the biosphere, and the atmosphere. But now their use and significance have crossed boundaries to manifold applications.\n\nGeological surveys are still useful in the twenty-first century, particularly for identifying and mitigating environmental risks brought on by unsustainable mining activities.\nRadiometric surveys have been used to identify radioactive contamination of streams near goldfields is the 90s.\nThe geological survey is an essential engineering discipline used in the extraction of minerals and hydrocarbons.\nGeological information is crucial in assisting in the mitigation of damage due to natural disasters.\nGeological surveys have led the exploration of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas, etc.) and concentrations of geothermal energy.\nGeo Tourism includes the physical attributes of a region as tourism attractions. India is a country with diverse physical attributes, a rich cultural heritage, and eventful ancient history. Tourism plays a major role in showcasing this great country to the rest of the world. Of late, there has been significant initiative in promoting tourism even in the remotest corners of the country.\nGeo tourism in India\n\nIndian subcontinent exhibits an imprint of varied geological processes through the ages and is a storehouse of interesting geological features.\n\nThe geological Survey of India has already enlisted some of those locales as National Geological Monuments.\n\nIt is imperative that the Tourist Map of India would be greatly enriched by the inclusion of these geological monuments and alike so that visitors from the country and abroad can have an insight into the real past \u2013 the formation of the subcontinent, the orogeny, the palaeoenvironment and the exotic collection of paleo \u2013 flora and fauna.\n\nFossil Parks\nMarine Gondwana Fossil Park, Manendragarh, Sarguja district, Chattisgarh: Unique exposure of fossiliferous marine Permian (280\u2010 240 Ma) rocks of Talchir Formation belonging to Gondwana Supergroup\nFossil Wood Parks: Akal Fossil Wood Park, Jaisalmer District, National Fossil Wood Park, Tamilnadu, National Fossil Wood Park in Sattanur, Perambalur\nSiwalik Fossil Park, Saketi, Sirmur District, Himachal Pradesh contains a rich collection of 2.5 million years old vertebrate fossils from Siwaliks.\nStromatolite Parks: Bhojunda, Chittaurgarh District, Rajasthan is an exposure within the massive Bhagwanpura Limestone of the Lower Vindhyan age; Jhamarkotra, Udaipur District, Rajasthan is the largest & richest deposit of phosphorite associated with stromatolite.\nRock Monuments\nPeninsular Gneiss National Monument at Lalbagh, Bangalore.

Heavy tropical rains form as the air cools and releases its moisture as it rises. As a result, an air mass that is cooler and drier flows away from the Equator. The air lowers and warms up once again as it gets closer to the tropics.\nThe air is dropping, which prevents clouds from forming and causes relatively little rain to fall on the ground below.\nThe Sahara, the largest and hottest desert in the world, is located in northern Africa. Almost the whole continental United States is contained within the Sahara Desert.\nThe Tanami Desert in northern Australia and the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa are two other subtropical deserts.\nCoastal Deserts\nDeserts along the coast are a result of cold ocean currents. A layer of fog is created when cold water contacts wind that is blowing toward shore. Onto land it drifts, this dense fog.\nDespite the high humidity, there are no atmospheric shifts that would ordinarily result in rain. A coastal desert may be nearly entirely dry but foggy.\nOn Chile\u2019s Pacific coast, there is a coastal desert called the Atacama Desert. The Atacama frequently has fog covering some of its terrains. However, years may pass in this area with little rain. The driest area on Earth is, in reality, the Atacama Desert. In the Atacama, some weather stations have never recorded any rain.\nRain Shadow Deserts\nDeserts in the rain shadow can be found close to the leeward slopes of various mountain ranges. Slopes on a leeward side are windward.\nAir with moisture is forced to climb when it encounters a mountain range. After cooling, the air condenses to form clouds that release precipitation onto windward slopes. When the air crosses the peak and starts to descend the leeward slopes, there isn\u2019t much moisture remaining. It becomes challenging for clouds to develop when the air descends due to warming.\nA rain shadow desert, Death Valley is located in the American states of California and Nevada.\nThe Sierra Nevada mountains\u2019 rain shadow is where you\u2019ll find Death Valley, which is also the lowest and driest region in North America.\nInterior Deserts\nBecause no moist winds can reach interior deserts, which are found in the centre of continents, they nevertheless remain. Air masses from coastal regions have completely lost all of their moisture by the time they reach the inland. Inland deserts are another name for interior deserts.\nLocated in China and Mongolia, the Gobi Desert is hundreds of kilometres from the sea. The moisture in the winds by the time they reach the Gobi is long gone. The Himalayan mountains to the south cast a rain shadow over the Gobi as well.\nPolar Deserts\nDeserts are a category that includes parts of the Arctic and Antarctic. There is a lot of water in these arctic deserts, but the majority of it is permanently frozen in glaciers and ice sheets. So, even though there are millions of litres of water present, there isn\u2019t much that plants and animals can use.\nThe world\u2019s largest desert is also the coldest. The majority of the Antarctic continent is a polar desert with little precipitation. Few living things can survive Antarctica\u2019s icy, arid climate.\nThe climate of Deserts of the world\nDesert evenings are often frigid because there isn\u2019t much moisture in the air to absorb and hold onto the heat produced by the high daytime temperatures.\nThe desert biome is an extremely difficult land mass to live in due to the combination of high-temperature variations and exceedingly limited water availability.\nDue to the lack of moisture in the atmosphere to screen off the sun\u2019s beams, temperatures are extremely high during the day.\nThis indicates that the energy from the sun is absorbed by the ground.\nThe air around the ground then becomes warmer.\nThe exact reverse occurs as night falls.\nThe heat collected during the day is radiated back to the atmosphere by the heated ground and hot air, causing a sharp drop in temperature.\nAt night, temperatures can fall to 0 degrees Celsius.\nPrecipitation of Deserts\nThe amount of precipitation in hot, deserts differs greatly from the amount of precipitation in cold deserts.\nDeserts that are both hot and cold often only get 15 cm of rain on average annually.\nIn contrast, cold deserts receive an average of 15\u201326 cm of rain in the spring and encounter heavy snowfall.\nSeasons of Deserts\nDesert biomes experience significant seasonal climate variations.\nTemperatures in the summertime range from 30 to 49 degrees Celsius. Precipitation levels are low or nonexistent throughout the summer.\nAdditionally, precipitation usually occurs at a faster pace than evaporation.\nTemperatures in the winter range from 10 to 20 degrees Celsius. During these summer months, there is a lot of precipitation.\nNatural Vegetation of Deserts of the world\nThe very little rainfall experienced in desert biomes, as well as extreme daily temperature fluctuations, makes life difficult for plants.\nDespite these challenges, a wide range of plants grows in this biome.\nCacti, tiny shrubs, succulents, and grasses are the most typical plants that flourish in desert biomes.\nDesert plants have evolved special adaptations to survive in these challenging environmental circumstances.\nTo reduce water loss, common adaptations include storing water in stems and leaves, coating leaves with wax, and dropping leaves.\nSome plants have grown long tap roots so they can access water tables.\nWhile others go dormant until the rains come again.\nParticularly the cactus plant, which may grow up to 20 feet tall and live for over 200 years since it has successfully adapted to the extreme climatic conditions of desert biomes.\nBecause of its shallow roots, the Giant Saguaro cactus in particular has survived in this hostile habitat by soaking up rain and dew before it evaporates. Additionally, it has a pliable inside that can expand and store a lot of water. The cactus\u2019 modest growth rate is another adaptation that helps it conserve energy.\nAnother plant adapted to survive in desert biomes is the magma tree. It is made up of tiny leaves that grow peculiarly upwards and serve as a funnel during rain.\nRainwater is directed by the funnel-shaped leaves to the tree\u2019s base, where shallow roots suck it up. In general, this adaptation ensures that the tree will receive a significant amount of water when it rains. Brittle Bush, Desert Ironwood, Chainfruit Cholla, Joshua Tree, Palo Verde, Jumping Cholla, Ocotillo, Pancake Prickly Pear Cactus, Soaptree Yucca, and Mojave Aster are more plants found in the desert habitat.\nAnimal Life of Deserts of the world\nDespite the harsh climatic conditions in the desert biome, many animals live here.\nThese animals have developed unique adaptations to help them keep cool and use less water.\nFor example, a recognizable desert animal like the Camel can get by for days without food and water due to the fat stored in its hump. It also has thick fur and underwool to protect it from the harshest of winter. Its nostrils can be closed to keep out blowing sand. A camel has two rows of eyelashes to shield its eyes from the sun and blowing winds and broad hooves to prevent it from sinking in the sand.\nFoxes survive here due to their burrowing and nocturnal lifestyles. This burrowing ensures they escape the intense heat during the day. They also have large ears to aid in the dissipation of excess body heat during hot days. Their thick, sandy fur helps protect them from cold nights in the desert. The thick, sandy fur also helps reflect heat and camouflage.\nAnimals in deserts of the world have also developed adaptations such as panting to minimize heat, seasonal migration, and long periods of dormancy that lasts until triggered by moisture and temperature conditions.\nOther animals in the desert biome include Bobcats, Coyotes, Javelina, Desert Tortoise, Cactus Wren, Desert Kangaroo Rat, Sonoran Desert Toads, Thorny Devils, Desert Bighorn Ship, Armadillo Lizards, Sonoran Pronghorn Antelope, so on.\nThe Largest Deserts in the world\nThe polar regions are home to the two biggest deserts on Earth.\nAbout 5.5 million square kilometres of the Antarctic continent are covered by the Polar Desert.\nThe Arctic Polar Desert is the second-largest desert.\nParts of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia are included in its territory. There are roughly 5.4 million square miles of surface area.\nNon-Polar Deserts of the world\nOutside of the polar regions are the last deserts on earth.\nThe Sahara Desert, a subtropical desert in northern Africa, is the biggest.\nAbout 3.5 million square miles of the surface area make up its perimeter.\n\nSome Major Deserts of the world are tables below,\n\nMajor Deserts of the World\nName\tType of Desert\tSurface Area\tLocation\nAntarctic\tPolar\t5.5 million mi\u00b2\tAntarctica\nArctic\tPolar\t5.4 million mi\u00b2\tAlaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia\nSahara\tSubtropical\t3.5 million mi\u00b2\tNorthern Africa\nArabian\tSubtropical\t1 million mi\u00b2\tArabian Peninsula\nGobi\tCold Winter\t500,000 mi\u00b2\tChina and Mongolia\nPatagonian\tCold Winter\t260,000 mi\u00b2\tArgentina\nGreat Victoria\tSubtropical\t250,000 mi\u00b2\tAustralia\nKalahari\tSubtropical\t220,000 mi\u00b2\tSouth Africa, Botswana, Namibia\nGreat Basin\tCold Winter\t190,000 mi\u00b2\tUnited States\nSyrian\tSubtropical\t190,000 mi\u00b2\tSyria, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia\nChihuahuan\tSubtropical\t175,000 mi\u00b2\tMexico\nGreat Sandy\tSubtropical\t150,000 mi\u00b2\tAustralia\nKara-Kum\tCold Winter\t135,000 mi\u00b2\tUzbekistan, Turkmenistan\nColorado Plateau\tCold Winter\t130,000 mi\u00b2\tUnited States\nGibson\tSubtropical\t120,000 mi\u00b2\tAustralia\nSonoran\tSubtropical\t120,000 mi\u00b2\tUnited States, Mexico\nKyzyl-Kum\tCold Winter\t115,000 mi\u00b2\tUzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan\nTaklamakan\tCold Winter\t105,000 mi\u00b2\tChina\nIranian\tCold Winter\t100,000 mi\u00b2\tIran\nThar\tSubtropical\t75,000 mi\u00b2\tIndia, Pakistan\nSimpson\tSubtropical\t56,000 mi\u00b2\tAustralia\nMojave\tSubtropical\t54,000 mi\u00b2\tUnited States\nAtacama\tCool Coastal\t54,000 mi\u00b2\tChile\nNamib\tCool Coastal\t13,000 mi\u00b2\tAngola, Namibia, South Africa\nThar Desert\nThus, the collective noun for the area\u2019s sand ridges, is where the name Thar originates.\nIt is split between Punjab and Sindh provinces in eastern Pakistan and Rajasthan state in northern India.\nOver 2,000 000 square kilometres of the Thar Desert are covered by dry terrain.\nIt creates a natural barrier along the Pakistan-India border.\nThe desert has an undulating topography with low barren hills, or bakers, that abruptly emerge from the surrounding plains and high and low dunes divided by sandy plains.\nThe dunes are constantly shifting, changing in size and shape. A crescent-shaped dune called a barkhan is created by wind that blows primarily in one direction. It is one of the most prevalent kinds of the dune, and it may be found worldwide in sandy deserts.\nThe irrigated Indus River plain, the Punjab Plain, the Aravalli Range, and the Rann of Kachchh all about the Thar Desert on its western, northern, and northeastern sides, respectively.\nDue to the persistently high pressure and subsidence at that latitude, the Thar Desert has a subtropical desert climate.\nThe Thar is typically avoided by the dominant southwest monsoon winds, which bring rain to much of the subcontinent in summer.\nConclusion\n\nA type of biome known as a desert is characterised by extremely high temperatures and very little precipitation (25 cm or less in a year). It is a significant kind of ecosystem that sustains a population of unique plants and animals. Deserts make up about 30% of the planet\u2019s total land area.\n\nSince the beginning of time, there have been natural causes for desert creation; it is the manmade causes that are of concern. The UN convention to combat desertification must be followed by an action plan to counteract it (UNCCD).\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

The literal meaning of the term vortex is the anti-clockwise movement of air that retains the cold air nearby the poles.\n\nIt is observed that throughout the winters in Northern Hemisphere, the polar low-pressure becomes comparatively less stable and often expands, sending cold Arctic air toward the south over the US with the jet stream.\n\nIt is primarily present in the upper troposphere that sometimes extends to the lower stratosphere, especially at the poles. It is a constant low-pressure area that rotates at the upper level of the north pole in an anti-clockwise direction, and at the South Pole, it rotates in a clockwise direction.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe polar low-pressure area has been in the bulletins afterwards the northern hemisphere faced its coldest age or phase during the winter season of 2013-2014. Furthermore, this same freezing air force came back in 2020. This time countries like the USA, Canada, and Russia suffered undergone one of their coldest winter seasons ever recorded.\n\nDuration and Strength of a\u00a0 Polar Vortex\n\nThe duration and strength of a Polar Vortex are as follows:\n\nStrength\nA Polar low-pressure area is at its highest during the winter and its lowest during the summer.\nIn the event of a volcanic eruption, a polar vortex will be further strengthened and it can stay that way for up to two years after the initial eruption\nThere will be a single vortex when the Arctic low-pressure is elongated in shape with two cyclone centres.\nThe Antarctic polar low-pressure is far more persistent than the Arctic variant.\nClimate phenomena related to the\u00a0La Nina will significantly strengthen a polar low-pressure.\nDuration\nThe Arctic polar vortex breaks up between mid-March to mid-May. This event marks the end of winter and the beginning of spring. Farming activities, ecosystems, and other weather cycles are impacted by this event\nThe same transition also impacts sea ice, ozone, air temperature, and cloud formation as well.\nAn early breakup of the polar low-pressure leads to one warming period that lasts from late February to mid-March. A late breakup period will lead to two warming periods, one in January and one in March.\nThere are times when the polar vortex breaks off before the end of the last warming period. If it is big enough then it can move into Canada and the Midwestern, Central and Northeastern United States\nPolar Vortex and Global Warming\n\nMany a time, the polar low pressure is associated with global warming. It is believed that many global warming issues are caused due to polar Vortex.\n\nThe worldwide temperature has increased by approx. 0.8\u00b0C since the 1880s.\nThe Arctic has heated and melted at more than double the rate due to the polar low pressure.\nThe North Pole, North America, and other similar regions have very little temperature difference from the Arctic region.\nThe jet stream\u2019s energy moves upward, disturbing the Polar Vortex and initiating it to split.\nImpacts of Polar low-pressure area on Earth\u2019s atmosphere\n\nA polar vortex and its related events can have the following impacts on the Earth\u2019s environment.\n\nThe Polar low-pressure breakups in the higher atmosphere can have significant sudden or delayed impacts on the environment, such as decreasing atmospheric temperature and extremely harsh cold in the winter in the Eastern United States, Western regions & Northern Europe.\nAbrupt stratospheric warming due to the polar Vortex can lead to the warm Arctic region in the stratosphere as well as the troposphere.\nThe warm Arctic region works in favour of cold air and causes more harsh winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and mid-latitudes comprising the Eastern United States.\nFeatures of Polar Vortex\n\nA polar low-pressure swirls over the stratosphere, 10-48 Km above the ground level.\n\nA stronger or more potent polar vortex act as a protective barrier for the mid-latitudes protecting them from cold Arctic air.\nTypically, it happens when the polar low-pressure is most potent and cold air is less prone to fall deep into the mid-latitudes, including Northern US and Europe.\nHowever, the polar Vortex sometimes gets disrupted or weakens because of the wave energy rising skyward from the Earth\u2019s lower atmosphere.\nSuch happenings or events with the polar Vortex abruptly warm the stratosphere in just a few days, and this event is known as sudden stratospheric warming far above the Earth\u2019s surface.\nAs a consequence of this stratospheric warming, the polar low-pressure tends to shift its location a little toward the south of the north pole. Sometimes this shift splits the polar Vortex into \u2018sister vortices\u2019.\nSlipping or Shifting of the Polar low-pressure area\n\nA Polar vortex goes across somewhere above 650 North and South latitudes.\n\nThe polar Vortex becomes very powerful when the temperature contrast between the polar low-pressure and temperate regions is highest. At this stage, its meandering is insignificant or nearly null.\nHowever, the polar vortex meander is known as Rossby waves when this temperature contrast is slight.\nThe slight temperature contrast does not mean the summertime.\nThe meandering polar Vortex generates irregular or flashing low-pressure & high-pressure chambers.\nHigh-pressure chambers are formed underneath the ridges, and low-pressure chambers are formed underneath the troughs.\nIt happens because of the upper air circulations shaped by the polar low pressure.\nDue to the severe meandering of the Polar low-pressure, the high-pressure chambers force over to the north and shift the polar low-pressure from its standard position.\nIt means the polar low-pressure moves far from the pole and glides into the temperate regions having extremely low pressure.\nAs soon as the polar low-pressure holds back its strength, the high-pressure chambers become ineffectual and move back to their original latitudinal positions.\nThe polar vortex shifts or slips back to its original position or poles with the shift in high-pressure chambers.\nHow polar vortex shifts to the south?\n\nA high-pressure system from the west pushed the jet stream, and a portion of the polar Vortex shifted farther south than the normal position.\n\nThat brought a portion of the Polar Vortex well into North America and caused the temperature in the Midwest and the eastern US to dive to zero.\n\nPolar low-pressure area and Ozone layer Depletion\n\nEven though polar low-pressure and ozone layer depletion is two entirely diverse topics, however related phenomena of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThere is a constant decline in the total amount of the ozone layer, approx.\u20144% in the Earth\u2019s stratosphere. Additionally, a considerable reduction in the stratospheric ozone layer is observed in the vicinity of the Earth\u2019s polar regions.\n\nThe chemical makeup of the Antarctic polar low-pressure has led to severe ozone depletion. The nitric acid in the stratospheric clouds reacts with chlorofluorocarbons to form chlorine which further accelerates the destruction of the ozone layer.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe only threat of the Polar low-pressure to humans is the degree of cold temperatures that could get low when the polar low-pressure area spreads out and send Arctic air toward the south into the regions that are not cold usually.\n\nThe mild winters in the northern regions of the hemisphere which are particularly south of the Arctic circle have led to a decrease in energy consumption by the people.\n\nRead:\u00a0Polar Code\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

For the promotion of agricultural mechanization in the country, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme \u2018Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization\u2019 (SMAM) is being implemented through the State Governments since 2014-15. Read here to learn more about the status of agricultural mechanization in India.\n\nAgriculture and allied sectors contribute approximately 14 percent to GDP and 49.6 percent to the labor force. The importance of agriculture is higher in rural areas with 57 percent of the rural population employed in the sector and 60 percent of the household dependent on it.\n\nThe agricultural sector is facing several challenges small farm holdings, which are continuing to decrease in size, decreasing farm labor (estimated to drop to approximately 26 percent of the labor force by 2050), and a future water scarcity crisis to name a few.\n\nFarmers\u2019 income has not been able to keep pace, such as to cater to increasing costs of production including that of rising labor wages. Hence, there is a strong case for labor-substituting farm/agriculture machinery.\n\nParallelly, it is also important to note, that several activities are highly time-bound, and unless executed as per schedule, the farmer is likely to suffer loss. Agriculture mechanization is an appropriate answer to such challenges.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMechanization of Indian Agriculture\nAdvantages of mechanization of Indian agriculture\nLimitations for mechanization of Indian agriculture\nInitiatives of the Government of India to Promote Farm Mechanization\nSub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM)\nWay forward\nMechanization of Indian Agriculture\n\nThe farm mechanization levels assessed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) for major cereals, pulses, oil seeds, millets, and cash crops indicate that:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe seedbed preparation operation is highly mechanized (more than 70%) for major crops\nHarvesting and threshing operation is the least mechanized (lower than 32%) for major crops except for rice and wheat crops.\nIn seedbed preparation, the mechanization level is higher in rice and wheat crops as compared to other crops.\nHowever, the mechanization level for sowing operations is the highest for wheat crops (65%).\nThe mechanization levels in planting/transplanting operations for sugarcane and rice crops are 20% and 30%, respectively.\nIn the case of harvesting and threshing, the mechanization levels in rice and wheat crops are more than 60% and very less in cotton crops.\n\nFarm power availability in India is estimated at 2.02 kW/hectare. Mechanization level in India is about 40-45 percent with states such as UP, Haryana, and Punjab having very high mechanization levels but north-eastern states having negligible mechanization.\n\nIn the dairy and livestock sector, which is largely integrated with an associated industry, the adoption of mechanization has been more common.\nIn the fisheries sector, the adoption of mechanization has been even more, and it has reaped major benefits.\n\nThe use of improved implements has the potential to increase productivity by up to 30 percent and reduce the cost of cultivation by up to 20 percent. At present, Indian farmers are adopting farm mechanization at a faster rate in comparison to the recent past.\n\nAccording to the World Bank estimates, half of the Indian population would be urban by the year 2050.\n\nIt is estimated that the percentage of agricultural workers in the total workforce would drop to 25.7% by 2050 from 58.2% in 2001.\n\nThus, there is a need to enhance the level of farm mechanization in the country. Due to the intensive involvement of labor in different farm operations, the cost of production of many crops is quite high.\n\nAdvantages of mechanization of Indian agriculture\n\nFarm mechanization or more appropriately agriculture mechanization will have a positive impact in numerous ways-\n\nIt will let off the wage labor as also the farmer of the drudgery involved in manual operations.\nenhanced manpower productivity since skills is integral to machine-based operations.\nEffective use of agriculture machinery helps to increase productivity & production of output, undertake timely farm operations, and enable the farmers to quickly rotate crops on the same land.\nMechanization also helps in animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries.\nFarm mechanization not only provides optimal utilization of resources e.g., land, labor, and water but helps farmers to save valuable time and also reduces drudgery.\nMechanization results in a shift from \u2018subsistence farming\u2019 to \u2018commercial agriculture. This shift occurs mainly due to the need for more land and capital to be associated with farmers to reap the full technological benefits.\nIt results in a significant modification of the social structure in rural areas. It frees the farmers from much of the laborious, tedious, hard work on the farms. The pressure on land decreases and the status of the farmers improves.\nLimitations for mechanization of Indian agriculture\n\nFarm mechanization and crop productivity have a direct correlation as farm mechanization saves time and labor, reduces drudgery, cut down production costs in the long run, reduces postharvest losses, and boosts crop output and farm income.\n\nHowever, given the scale of India\u2019s agricultural sub-sectors, mechanization is yet to penetrate all across regions and farm types\n\nLack of access to farm power is one of the primary reasons for the slow uptake of farm mechanization and hence the non-intensification of farm productivity, particularly among small and marginal farmers.\nOne of the main limitations to deploying farming machines is the capacity of a farm to efficiently own such equipment.\nFarm equipment is capital-intensive, making it a major investment for small and marginal farmers.\nQuality of after-sale service is another concern due to the inadequacy of proper maintenance in remote regions of rural areas.\nThe unwillingness of commercial banks to finance farm equipment is one of the biggest impediments to the increase in mechanization level in India.\n\nThe basic defect of mechanization is that it will result in too many agricultural workers becoming surplus. Millions of farmers will be thrown out of land and will have to be provided alternative sources of employment.\n\nInitiatives of the Government of India to Promote Farm Mechanization\n\nAgricultural mechanization is crucial in the agriculture sector as it contributes towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the inputs used in crop production thereby also increasing the productivity of crops. This also reduces the drudgery associated with various farm operations.\n\nSub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM)\n\nTo boost farm mechanization in the country, a special dedicated Centrally Sponsored scheme \u2018Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM)\u2019 has been introduced by the Government of India in 2014-15.\n\nThe scheme aims at \u2018reaching the unreached\u2019 by making farm machines accessible and affordable for small and marginal farmers (SMFs) through the establishment of Custom Hiring Centers (CHCs), creating Hubs for hi-tech & high-value farm equipment, and Farm Machinery Banks.\nDistribution of various subsidized agricultural equipment and machines to the individual farmer is also one of the activities under the scheme.\nPurchasing farm machines for SMFs is not financially feasible therefore custom hiring institutions provide hiring options for machines to SMFs.\nCreating awareness among stakeholders through the demonstration of machine operations and skill development of farmers and youth and others are also components of SMAM.\nThe performance testing and certification of machines at designated testing centers located all over the country are ensuring farm machinery qualitatively, effectively, and efficiently.\n\nUnder this scheme, financial assistance at 40% to 50% of the cost of machines depending on the categories of farmers, is provided for the purchase of agricultural machines.\n\nFinancial assistance at 40% of the project cost is also provided to rural youth & farmers as an entrepreneur, Cooperative Societies of Farmers, Registered Farmers Societies, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), and Panchayats for the establishment of Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs), and Hi-tech hubs of high-value agricultural machine.\n\nWay forward\n\nBetter mechanization of Indian Agriculture requires more establishment of custom hiring centers and the development of an institutional framework for these centers are essential steps that need to be taken.\n\nMake In India can be used to support local manufacturing of farm implements currently being imported.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility funds can be used for the capacity-building initiative in the farm equipment space as well as promoting a sustainable agricultural ecosystem.\n\nIt is pertinent to devise a framework that would strengthen the credit policy for farm machinery in India. Credit guarantee fund currently facilitates loans for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Similar models should be devised for the farm machinery sector as well.\n\nAlso read: Agriculture export policy\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Meghalayan history began between 2190 and 1990 BCE.\nA 200-year drought that affected the Eastern Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and the Yangtze River Valley marked the start of the period.\n\nAlso read: Geohazards and their Management\n\nHow are geologic time scale divisions decided?\n\nA variety of event categories are used to determine the division dates of the numerous eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages. These occasion categories comprise, but are not restricted to:\n\nThe first occurrence of a species: All biological forms are included in this (plants, animals, bacteria, etc). The \u201cfirst of first\u201d species are of particular interest (e.g., the first oxygen-breathing organism, the first seed-producing plant, and so on).\nKey species going extinct or catastrophic extinctions: A huge number of species going extinct in a short period of geologic time is known as a mass extinction. The Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, when most dinosaur species became extinct, is a well-known illustration of mass extinction.\nMajor worldwide climate shifts: when the climate significantly diverges from the average for the time, as during ice ages.\nSupercontinental formation and/or breakup: When all significant landmasses on the surface of the Earth combine to form one landmass, supercontinents are created.\nCatastrophic events: Major catastrophes can result in or set off other occurrences like extinctions and climate change. Major floods, meteorite impacts, and volcanic eruptions are examples of catastrophic catastrophes.\nGlobal magnetic polarity shifts: The planet\u2019s magnetic polarity \u201cflips\u201d on an irregular basis, with the North pole switching places with the South pole.\n\nVarious significant events throughout history have been considered to divide the geologic time scale.\n\nFor instance, a significant portion of Earth\u2019s plant and animal species disappeared during a global extinction that occurred during the transition between the Permian and Triassic periods.\nAnother illustration is the transition from the Precambrian to the Paleozoic, which is shown by the emergence of the first animals with hard parts.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

The islands of the Antarctic region are:\n\nThe South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, South Georgia, and the South Sandwich Islands, all claimed by the United Kingdom;\nPeter I Island and Bouvet Island, claimed by Norway;\nHeard and McDonald Islands, claimed by Australia;\nScott Island and the Balleny Islands, claimed by New Zealand.\n\nAlso read: Solstice and Equinox\n\nPhysical geography\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nThe Antarctic Ice Sheet is the largest single piece of ice on Earth. The ice surface dramatically grows in size from about three million square kilometers (1.2 million square miles) at the end of summer to about 19 million square kilometers (7.3 million square miles) by winter.\n\nAntarctica has several mountain summits, including the Transantarctic Mountains, which divide the continent into eastern and western regions.\n\nWithout any ice, Antarctica would emerge as a giant peninsula and archipelago of mountainous islands, known as Lesser Antarctica, and a single large landmass about the size of Australia, known as Greater Antarctica.\n\nGreater Antarctica, or East Antarctica, is composed of older, igneous and metamorphic rocks.\nLesser Antarctica, or West Antarctica, is made up of younger, volcanic and sedimentary rock. It is part of the Ring of Fire around the Pacific Ocean.\nMount Erebus, located on Antarctica\u2019s Ross Island, is the southernmost active volcano on Earth.\nClimate and Waters\n\nAntarctica has an extremely cold, dry climate.\n\nWinter temperatures along Antarctica\u2019s coast generally range from -10\u00b0 to -30\u00b0C (14\u00b0 to -22\u00b0F).\nDuring the summer, coastal areas hover around 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) but can reach temperatures as high as 9\u00b0C (48\u00b0F).\n\nThe Antarctic region has an important role in global climate processes. It is an integral part of Earth\u2019s heat balance.\n\nIce is more reflective than land or water surfaces. The massive Antarctic Ice Sheet reflects a large amount of solar radiation away from the Earth\u2019s surface.\nAs global ice cover (ice sheets and glaciers) decreases, the reflectivity of Earth\u2019s surface also decreases.\nThis allows more incoming solar radiation to be absorbed by Earth\u2019s surface, causing an unequal heat balance linked to global warming, the current period of climate change.\n\nThe waters surrounding Antarctica are a key part of the \u201cocean conveyor belt,\u201d a global system in which water circulates the globe based on density and currents.\n\nThe cold waters surrounding Antarctica, known as the Antarctic Bottom Water, are so dense that they push against the ocean floor.\nThe Antarctic Bottom Water causes warmer waters to rise, or upwell.\nAntarctic upwelling is so strong that it helps move water around the entire planet. This movement is aided by strong winds that circumnavigate Antarctica. Without the aid of the oceans around Antarctica, Earth\u2019s waters would not circulate in a balanced and efficient manner.\n\nThe Antarctic Ocean was officially recognized as the Southern Ocean by the National Geographic Society in 2021.\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nLichens, mosses, and terrestrial algae are among the few species of vegetation that grow in Antarctica. More of this vegetation grows in the northern and coastal regions of Antarctica, while the interior has little if any vegetation.\n\nThe waters surrounding Antarctica are among the most diverse on the planet. Upwelling allows phytoplankton and algae to flourish.\n\nThousands of species, such as krill, feed on the plankton. Fish and a large variety of marine mammals thrive in the cold Antarctic waters.\nBlue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), right, minke, sei (Balaenoptera borealis), and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) have healthy populations in Antarctica.\nOne of the top predators in Antarctica is the leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx). The leopard seal is one of the most aggressive of all marine predators.\nThe most familiar animal of Antarctica is probably the penguin. They have adapted to the cold, coastal waters.\nThe political history of Antarctica\n\nFor many European and North American powers, Antarctica represented the last great frontier for human exploration. Supported by advances in science and navigation, many explorers took on the \u201cRace for the Antarctic\u201d.\n\nBy the early 20th century, explorers started to traverse the interior of Antarctica. The aim of these expeditions was often more competitive than scientific. Explorers wanted to win the \u201cRace to the South Pole\u201d more than understand Antarctica\u2019s environment.\nBecause early explorers confronted extreme obstacles and debilitating conditions, this period became known as the \u201cHeroic Age\u201d.\n\nThe second half of the 20th century was a time of change initially fueled by the Cold War, a period defined by the division between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the threat of nuclear war.\n\nThe International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1957-58 aimed to end Cold War divisions among the scientific community by promoting global scientific exchange.\n\nThe IGY prompted an intense period of scientific research in the Antarctic. Many countries conducted their first Antarctic explorations and constructed the first research stations in Antarctica.\n\nTo prevent conflict over Antarctica, an international treaty governing the usage of the continent was negotiated by a dozen nations, including the United States, the Soviet Union, and other major powers.\n\nThe Antarctic Treaty was agreed upon in 1959 and entered into force in 1961. Today, 47 nations have signed the treaty.\nThe treaty established that \u2018the region south of 60\u00b0S latitude remain politically neutral; no nation or group of people can claim any part of the Antarctic as territory; countries cannot use the region for military purposes or to dispose of radioactive waste, and research can only be done for peaceful purposes.\u2019\nThe Antarctic Treaty was an important geopolitical milestone because it was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War.\n\nThe Antarctic Treaty does support territorial claims made before 1961, by New Zealand, Australia, France, Norway, the United Kingdom, Chile, and Argentina. Under the treaty, the size of these claims cannot be changed and new claims cannot be made.\n\nResearch in Antarctica\n\nWhile the Antarctic does not have permanent human residents, the region is a busy outpost for a variety of research scientists.\n\nThese scientists work at government-supported research stations and come from dozens of different countries.\nThe number of scientists conducting research varies throughout the year, from about 1,000 in winter to around 5,000 in summer.\nThe exploration of Antarctica began in the early 1800s.\nIn 1984, a meteorite from Mars was found in Antarctica. The markings on this meteorite were similar to markings left by bacteria on Earth.\n\nResearchers from a variety of scientific backgrounds study the Antarctic not only as a unique environment but also as an indicator of broader global processes.\n\nGeographers map the surface of the world\u2019s coldest and most isolated continent.\nMeteorologists study climate patterns, including the \u201cozone hole\u201d that opens over the Antarctic.\nClimatologists track the history of Earth\u2019s climate using ice cores from Antarctica\u2019s pristine ice sheet.\nMarine biologists study the behavior of marine fauna especially whales, seals, and squid.\nAstronomers make observations from Antarctica\u2019s interior because it offers the clearest view of space from Earth.\nEven astrobiologists, who study the possibility of life outside Earth\u2019s atmosphere, study materials found in the Antarctic.\nIndian Antarctic Programme\n\nThe National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), inside the Ministry of Earth Sciences of India, is in charge of the multidisciplinary Indian Antarctic Programme.\n\nThe first Indian expedition to Antarctica was in 1981.\n\nThe initiative acquired acceptability on a global scale after India signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1983 and built the Dakshin Gangotri Antarctic research outpost, which was replaced by the Maitri site in 1989.\nBharati, a base made of 134 shipping containers, was the most recent one to be put into service in 2012.\nIndia, which has made 40 scientific excursions to the Antarctic, is studying atmospheric, biological, earth, chemical, and medicinal sciences as part of the program.\n\nRead here: Indian Antarctic Bill 2022\n\nFuture concerns\n\nTwo important and related issues that concern the Antarctic region are climate change and tourism.\n\nAntarctic tourism has grown substantially in the last decade.\n\nOfficials worked closely with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) to establish better practices that would reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of tour ships.\nThe system hopes to encourage sustainable tourism to reduce the environmental impacts of the sensitive ecosystem.\n\nClimate change disproportionately affects the Antarctic region, as evidenced by reductions in the size of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and the warming waters off the coast.\n\nOver the past 50 years, the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula has been one of the most rapidly warming parts of the planet.\nIt has now been established that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is warming more rapidly than the global ocean as a whole.\nThe warming of the Antarctic Peninsula is causing changes to the physical and living environment of Antarctica.\nThe distribution of penguin colonies has changed as the sea ice conditions alter.\nThe melting of perennial snow and ice covers has resulted in increased colonization by plants.\nMany glaciers have retreated and ice shelves that formerly fringed the Peninsula have been observed to retreat in recent years and some have collapsed completely.\nEast Antarctic plateau is changing wind and ocean-current patterns around the continent, and ozone-destroying industrial chemicals have caused a hole in the ozone layer to open above the continent.\n\nThe Antarctic has become a symbol of climate change. Scientists and policymakers are focusing on changes in this environmentally sensitive region to push for its protection and the sustainable use of its scientific resources.\n\nWinter heatwave in Antarctica\n\nThe temperatures are currently in the range of minus 25 degrees to minus 30 degrees Celsius in parts of East Antarctica, the relatively higher-elevation swathe that makes up two-thirds of the world\u2019s coldest continent.\n\nFor the second time in two years, a record-breaking heatwave is sweeping through Antarctica at the height of its winter season.\nGround temperatures have been 10 degrees Celsius higher than normal on average since mid-July, and up to 28 degrees higher on certain days.\nDeep-winter temperatures here usually vary between minus 50 degrees and 60 degrees Celsius.\nScientists believe that the higher temperatures are mainly a consequence of the weakening of the polar vortex, the band of cold air and low-pressure systems that spins around the poles of the Earth in the stratosphere.\nThe vortex usually remains strong and stable during winter in the southern hemisphere, keeping cold air trapped over Antarctica and not letting hot air come in. Still, it has been disturbed this year by large-scale atmospheric waves (periodic disturbances in the fields of atmospheric variables).\n\nRead:\u00a0Polar Code\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

    "[CONTENT] #240": "What are the different theories related to the origin of the earth? Read further to know more.\n\nDifferent philosophers and scientists put forth a large number of hypotheses regarding the origin of the earth.\n\nOne of the earlier and popular arguments known as the Nebular Hypothesis was given by German philosopher Immanuel Kant, and later in 1796 Mathematician Laplace revised it. As per the hypothesis, the planets were formed out of a cloud of material associated with a youthful sun, which was slowly rotating.\n\nLater, it was believed by the arguments called binary theories that the sun had a companion that coexisted with it. \u00a0Otto Schmidt in Russia and Carl Weizascar in Germany each made some revisions to the \u201cnebular hypothesis\u201d in 1950, but with slightly different details.\n\nThey considered that the sun was surrounded by a solar nebula containing mostly hydrogen and helium along with dust. The friction and collision of particles led to the creation of a disk-shaped cloud and the planets were formed through the process of accretion. Later on, however, scientists began to focus on the origin of the universe as opposed to only the formation of the earth or the planets.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nModern Theories of Origin of the Universe\nThe Star Formation\nFormation of Planets\nOrigin of the Earth\nEvolution of Lithosphere\nEvolution of Atmosphere and Hydrosphere\nFurther Contribution\nOrigin of Life\nModern Theories of Origin of the Universe\n\nThe most popular argument regarding the origin of the universe is the Big Bang Theory which is also called expanding universe hypothesis. Edwin Hubble, in 1920, provided evidence that the universe is expanding and with the passage of time, galaxies move further and further apart.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAs per the Big Bang Theory, the following stages are in the development of the universe.\n\nIn the beginning, all matter forming the universe existed in one place in the form of a \u201ctiny ball\u201d (singular atom) with an unimaginably small volume, infinite temperature, and infinite density.\nThe \u201ctiny ball\u201d exploded violently and this led to a huge expansion. Nowadays, it is generally accepted that the big band event happened 13.7 billion years ago. Even today, the expansion is still going on. As it grew, some energy was converted into matter.\u00a0 Immediately following the bang, there was an especially rapid\u00a0expansion. The expansion has since slowed considerably. The first atom started to form within the first three minutes after the Big Bang.\nWithin 300,000 years from the Big Bang, the temperature dropped to 4,500K (Kelvin) and gave rise to atomic matter. The universe became transparent.\nThe Star Formation\n\nEven in the early universe, there was no distribution of matter and energy. The early variations in densities led to variations in gravitational forces, which brought the matter together. These served as the foundation for the development of galaxies.\n\nA galaxy has a large number of stars in it. A galaxy starts to form through the accumulation of hydrogen gas in the form of a very large cloud called a nebula.\n\nEventually, the growing nebula develops localized clumps of gas. These clumps continue to grow into even denser gaseous bodies, giving rise to the formation of stars. Such formation of stars is believed to happen some 5-6 billion years ago.\n\nFormation of Planets\n\nTo understand the origin of the earth, knowledge of the formation of the planet is important. The stages in the development of planets are:\n\nAs the stars are localized lumps of gas within a nebula, the gravitational force within the lumps leads to the formation of a core to the gas cloud.\nThe gas cloud begins to condense in the following stage, and the material surrounding the core transforms into tiny spherical shapes. The cohesion process transforms these small, spherical objects into planetesimals. Gravitational attraction causes the material to stick together as larger bodies begin to form as a result of collisions.\nIn the final stage, these large numbers of small planetesimals accrete to form fewer large bodies in the form of planets.\nOrigin of the Earth\n\nEarth was originally a hot, rocky, and barren object with a thin atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. This is far from the present-day picture of the earth.\u00a0 Therefore, there must have been some occasions or processes that led to the transition from a rocky, barren, and hot earth to a planet with an abundance of water and an environment that is favorable to the existence of life.\n\nThe structure of the earth is layered. The material that is present is not uniform from the outermost end\u00a0of the atmosphere to its centre. The atmospheric matter has the least density.\u00a0The interior of the earth is divided into different zones that extend from the surface to greater depths, and each of them contains materials with special characteristics.\n\nAlso read: Leap Year: How does it work?\n\nEvolution of Lithosphere\n\nThe earth was mostly in a volatile state during its primordial stage. The temperature inside has increased due to a gradual increase in density. Because of that, the material inside the earth started getting separated according to their densities.\n\nThis process made heavier materials (like iron) sink towards the center and lighter materials move towards the surface. With time it cooled further and solidified and condensed into a smaller size.\n\nThis later led to the formation of the outer surface which is known as the crust.\n\nAlso read: Indian Ocean Geoid Low\n\nEvolution of Atmosphere and Hydrosphere\n\nThe present composition of the atmosphere of the earth is chiefly made by the composition of nitrogen and oxygen. There are three stages in the evolution of the present atmosphere.\n\nThe first stage is marked by the loss of the primordial atmosphere.\nIn the second stage, the hot interior of the earth contributed to the evolution of the atmosphere.\nFinally, the composition of the atmosphere was modified by the living world through the process of photosynthesis.\nFurther Contribution\n\nRole of Solar Winds: According to the theory, the early atmosphere, dominated by hydrogen and helium has been stripped off as a result of the solar winds.\n\nDegassing: During the cooling of the earth, gases and water vapor were released from the interior solid earth. which contributes to the evolution of the present atmosphere. Water vapor, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, and relatively little free oxygen made up the majority of the early atmosphere. Degassing is the term used to describe the procedure that released the inside gases.\n\nCondensation: Continuous volcanic eruptions released water vapor and gases into the atmosphere. As the earth cooled, the released water vapor started getting condensed. As the temperature decreased over time, more condensation formed and more rain fell as the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was dissolved in the rainwater. The rainwater started getting collected in the depressions to give rise to oceans.\n\nOrigin of Life\n\nThe last phase in the evolution or origin of the earth relates to the origin and evolution of life. Initially, the earth or even the atmosphere of the earth was not conducive to the development of life. Scientists refer to the origin of life as a kind of chemical reaction, that first generated complex organic molecules and then assembled them. The assemblage suggested that the organic molecules could duplicate themselves.\n\nThe record of life that existed on this planet in different periods is found in rocks in the form of fossils. There have been discoveries of tiny structures that are closely akin to the current form of blue algae in geological formations that are much older than 3,000 million years. Based on that it is assumed that life began to evolve sometime 3,800 million years ago.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

    "[CONTENT] #243": "What are Ocean Water Circulation and deep ocean/water circulation? Check all the information in detail here.\n\nOcean circulation is one of the major elements of climate, moving heat, freshwater, nutrients, and dissolved gases. Ocean circulation at the largest spatial scales and long-time scales contains many elements that are in common in the different oceans. The ocean circulation is forced by:\n\nA fast and energetic wind-driven surface circulation: The winds, through a thin frictional layer called the Ekman layer and through the response of the interior ocean to mass, convergences, and divergences in this layer, and\nA slow and large density-driven circulation dominates the deep sea: Heating and cooling that change the temperature and processes that change the amount of fresh water and hence the salinity.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDeep Water Circulation\nWhere does the Deep Ocean Circulation Occur?\nImportance of Deep Water Circulation\nFactors Influencing Circulation\nDeep Water Circulation in the Indian Ocean\nConclusion\nDeep Water Circulation\n\nDeep Water Circulation is also called \u2018thermohaline\u2019 circulation because of the role of heating, cooling, freshening, and salification in producing regional density differences within the ocean.\n\nThe slow and deep water circulation is largely driven by water density, and thus its temperature and salinity. Whereas the thermohaline circulation or deep water/ocean circulation is forced by heating and cooling which is overshadowed by the wind-driven circulation.\n\nThe thermohaline circulation, for the most part, is an \u2018overturning\u2019 circulation in which warm water flows poleward near the surface and is subsequently converted into cold, dense water that sinks and flows equatorward in the interior.\n\nAlso read: Movements of ocean water: Waves, Tides and Ocean Currents\n\nWhere does the Deep Ocean Circulation Occur?\n\nDeep Ocean Circulation can only be formed in extremely cold regions where the air temperature is low enough to make the surface water exceedingly cold, highly salty, and denser than the water beneath it.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDeep currents hence generally form in higher latitude areas of the Earth, such as the North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water, and they move relatively slowly toward the equator from these icy poleward regions.\n\nNo deep water is formed at the sea surface in the North Pacific or northern Indian Ocean. The global thermohaline circulation thus consists of two intersecting cells, one with a sinking in the North Atlantic and the other with a sinking in the Antarctic.\n\nImportance of Deep Water Circulation\n\nHeat Distribution: It transports heat poleward into high latitudes. The thermohaline circulation is thought to be vulnerable to the warming and freshening of the Earth\u2019s polar regions.\n\nMaintaining Carbon Dioxide Levels: It plays a crucial part in regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by helping in the transportation of carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, where it can be stored for a long time.\n\nNutrition Distribution: The upwelling branch of the thermohaline circulation is important for the ocean\u2019s biota as it brings nutrient-rich deep water up to the surface.\n\nOcean Currents: They are in charge of shaping\u00a0the global oceans\u2019 circulation patterns as well as the ocean currents themselves. The marine ecosystem, weather patterns, and coastal regions are all impacted by these currents.\n\nFactors Influencing Circulation\n\nIce: The distribution of heat to the polar regions is largely dependent on thermohaline circulation. It affects the rate of sea ice formation close to the polar regions, which has an effect on other components of the climate system (such as the albedo).\n\nWind: Wind currents are the main force behind the movement of the ocean\u2019s surface layer. When surface water sinks into the deep ocean, the deep water is forced to move horizontally until it can find a region on the globe where it can rise back to the surface and complete its circulation loop.\n\nGreat Salinity Anomaly: When sea ice moves through the Fram Strait into the North Atlantic, it melts and leaves a layer of fresh water on the ocean\u2019s surface. Since it is less dense than saline water, this freshwater tends to remain at the surface of the ocean. This lower density deters the normal process of sinking at high latitudes that supports thermohaline circulation, which makes it more difficult for the northern movement of warm water from the equator.\n\nDeep Water Circulation in the Indian Ocean\n\nThere are no significant deep-water formations in the Indian Ocean on its own. It only serves as a host for Atlantic and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and Northern Component Water (NCW).\n\nMoreover, the northern parts of the Indian Ocean are located at one of the terminal ends of the Global Overturning Circulation (GOC), far away from the deep-water formation regions and oceanic seaways.\n\nFew studies have been conducted in the Indian Ocean to reconstruct past deep water circulations based on iron-manganese crust records and the authigenic neodymium isotope composition of sediment cores.\n\nHowever, authigenic neodymium isotope records are only accessible from the Bay of Bengal region, and iron-manganese crusts are found at greater depths and are only bathed by Atlantic and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), making it suitable only for the reconstruction of the history of AABW.\n\nHowever, they too cannot help as the Himalayan rivers that flow into the Bay also carry a substantial amount of Neodymium particulates.\n\nA recent study named Nature Communications, made by a team of researchers from the Goa-based National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research and the School of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at Goa University brings light on the issue.\n\nThe record demonstrates a clear shift from the Pacific water-dominated deep circulation system about nine million years ago, to the onset of a modern-like deep water circulation system in the Indian Ocean which includes Antarctic bottom water and northern component water during the Miocene-Pliocene transition (about six million years ago).\n\nOur discovery suggests a widespread impact of the late Miocene Central American Seaway closure on the evolution of ocean deep water circulation and validates the so-called Panama Closure Hypothesis.\n\nConclusion\n\nFishermen, traders, and navies have all shown a practical interest in the ocean\u2019s circulation. Curiosity about currents below the ocean\u2019s surface led to more in-depth descriptions of the ocean as a three-dimensional fluid as our understanding of ocean currents and our ability to see it below the surface increased.\n\nThe processes that govern the circulation are now well understood as a result of these observations. In this era of increasing concern over the Earth\u2019s climate, understanding ocean circulation is just as important as understanding air circulation and the biosphere.\n\nAlong with it is important to increase the capacity to study and predict it with ever-improved computer resolution and power.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

    "[CONTENT] #246": "\nJoshimath, a vital hub for travelers heading to Badrinath and Hemkund Sahib, saw fissures in the ground as a result of land subsidence, which sparked alarm and demonstrations among the local populace. What is Land Subsidence? How does it impact the daily life of people? Read further to know more.\n\nLand subsidence is defined as the downward, vertical movement of the Earth\u2019s surface, which can be brought on by both natural and human forces. Land subsidence differs from slope movement in that it requires little to no horizontal movement.\u00a0\n\nSubsidence can be caused by mining, pumping subsurface fluids like groundwater or petroleum, or tectonic forces that bend the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\nThese processes include groundwater dissolving underlying carbonate rock, gradual compaction of sediments, withdrawal of fluid lava from beneath a solidified rock crust, and pumping subsurface fluids like groundwater or petroleum.\n\nTectonic subsidence, which results from the crust\u2019s tectonic deformation, can provide space for sediment to build up and eventually lithify into sedimentary rock.\u00a0\n\nGeologists, geotechnical engineers, surveyors, engineers, urban planners, landowners, and the general public are all concerned about ground sinking on a global scale.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCauses of Land Subsidence\nDissolution of limestone\nMining\nExtraction of Petroleum and Natural gas\nEarthquake\nGroundwater Related Subsidence\nFaulting induced Subsidence\nSeasonal Effects\nLand subsidence in Joshimath\nImpacts of Land subsidence\nSolutions To Reduce Land Subsidence\nSlope stabilization\nPlanting vegetation\nControl of drainage\nStrengthening foundations\nPlanning and zoning\nConclusion\nCauses of Land Subsidence\n\nThe following are the causes of land subsidence.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDissolution of limestone\n\nIn karst terrains, where the degradation of limestone by fluid flow in the subsurface forms voids, subsidence frequently results in significant issues (i.e., caves).\n\n\u00a0Sinkholes that can be hundreds of meters deep can be created by this form of subsidence.\n\nMining\n\nSurface subsidence is a result of a number of subsurface mining techniques, particularly those that deliberately induce the extracted void to collapse such as pillar extraction, longwall mining, and any metalliferous mining technique that includes \u201ccaving,\u201d such as \u201cblock caving\u201d or \u201csub-level caving\u201d.\n\n\u00a0Mining-induced subsidence is reasonably predictable in its degree, appearance, and scope (usually very old workings).\n\nMining-related subsidence generally always only affects the region immediately above the mined area and a margin on all sides.\n\nThe worst damage to the natural environment, structures, and infrastructure is typically caused by the associated surface compressive and tensile strains, curvature, tilts, and horizontal displacement rather than the vertical magnitude of the subsidence itself, with the exception of drainage (including natural drainage).\n\nExtraction of Petroleum and Natural gas\n\nThe initial pressure in a natural gas field, which can reach 60 MPa (600 bar), will decrease over time if natural gas is collected from it.\n\nThe soil layers above the field are supported by pressure. If the gas is extracted, the compacted sediment caused by the overburden pressure could cause earthquakes and ground subsidence.\n\nPetroleum extraction can also result in considerable subsidence. Over the course of 34 years of petroleum extraction, the city of Long Beach, California, has seen 9 meters (30 ft) of elevation change, causing over $100 million in damage to the area\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nEarthquake\n\nVarious factors might contribute to land subsidence during an earthquake. Because of offset along fault lines, substantial sections of land are susceptible to abrupt subsidence during an earthquake.\n\nAnother cause of land subsidence is the settling and compacting of loose sediment brought on by an earthquake\u2019s shaking.\n\nGroundwater Related Subsidence\n\nThe sinking of land caused by the extraction of groundwater is referred to as groundwater-related subsidence.\n\nWithout sufficient pumping control and enforcement, it is becoming a bigger issue in developing countries as cities\u2019 populations and water usage rise.\n\nAccording to one estimate, excessive groundwater extraction is to blame for 80% of major land subsidence issues,\u00a0making it a global issue that is getting worse.\n\nThe degradation of organic matter can also be indirectly impacted by changes in groundwater levels. Lowlands, like coastal or delta plains, need to be drained in order to support human habitation.\n\nThe resultant oxygenation of the soil causes its organic constituents, including peat, to oxidize, and this process of decomposition may result in severe land subsidence.\n\nIn order to maintain ideal unsaturated zone depths and expose more and more peat to oxygen, this is particularly true when groundwater levels are frequently adjusted to subsidence.\n\nFaulting induced Subsidence\n\nWhen there are differential stresses in the Earth, they can be accommodated either by ductile flow in the hotter and more fluid mantle or by geological faulting in the brittle crust.\n\nAbsolute subsidence may happen in the normal faults\u2019 hanging wall where faults are present. The footwall can be used to measure relative subsidence in reversal or thrust faults.\n\nSeasonal Effects\n\nClay is present in large amounts in many soils. Changes in the moisture content of the soil have an impact on them because of the very small particle size.\n\nThe volume and surface of the soil are reduced as a result of seasonal drying. Building foundations move if they are over the level attained by seasonal drying, which could cause damage to the structure in the form of tapering cracks.\n\nThe seasonal drying of soils can be significantly influenced locally by trees and other vegetation. As the tree matures over several years, a cumulative drying takes place. When the tree deteriorates or is cut down, this may result in the reverse of sinking, known as heave or expansion of the soil.\n\nLand subsidence in Joshimath\n\nLand subsidence has occurred in Joshimath as a result of the town\u2019s geological location and the haphazard and widespread development that has taken place there and nearby.\n\nBecause Joshimath was constructed over the remnants of a previous landslide, even small triggers might cause the slopes to become unstable.\n\nIn India\u2019s seismic zonation plan, the town is also in Zone V, which denotes the highest danger.\n\nIt occupies a seismically active terrain because it is sandwiched between the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and the Vaikrita Thrust (VT).\n\nJoshimath is additionally vulnerable to severe weather because it is climatologically located in an area that commonly experiences concentrated, high-intensity rains.\n\nExtreme rainfall, for instance, might cause landslides because of how dangerously balanced the slopes are.\n\nJoshimath is a sand and stone deposit, thus it was not a good location to build a city since vibrations from blasting and excessive traffic would also cause natural variables to be out of balance.\n\n561 homes have reported cracks, and at least 66 families have left the area. According to a government official, more than 3000 people have been impacted thus far.\n\nImpacts of Land subsidence\nThe combined consequences of climate change (expressed as sea level rise, storm intensification, and storm surge), land subsidence, and increased urbanization lead to making sinking cities.\nDue to the city\u2019s inadequate drainage systems, land subsidence can result in the settlement of clay on upper levels, damaging the city\u2019s infrastructure (roads, bridges), and causing flood risk.\nAccording to experts, it might undermine buildings, including homes and other infrastructure, as well as cause fractures to appear in the foundations of the structures.\nWater management disturbance and associated repercussions such as changes in the gradient of streams, canals, drains, increased seawater intrusion, and increased pump power.\nFarmland production in deltaic areas has declined as a result of a reduction in freshwater availability caused by an increase in saltwater intrusion, coming from a reduction in land elevation caused by land subsidence.\nThe cessation of ground sinking can sometimes result in unexpected environmental issues.\nSolutions To Reduce Land Subsidence\n\nThe following are the various solutions\n\nSlope stabilization\n\nUsing methods like terracing or erecting retaining walls, slopes can be stabilized in order to prevent landslides and erosion.\n\nPlanting vegetation\n\nVegetation planting on slopes can aid in soil stabilization and erosion prevention. Slope stabilization is particularly effective with trees and other deep-rooted plants.\n\nControl of drainage\n\nIn hilly areas, it is crucial to effectively manage and maintain drainage systems since poor drainage can cause the land to sag. Installing culverts or other drainage systems may be necessary to direct water away from slopes and stop erosion.\n\nStrengthening foundations\n\nBuildings in mountainous communities may occasionally need to have their foundations reinforced in order to stop them from sliding or collapsing. This can entail adding strength to the foundations or underpinning them.\n\nPlanning and zoning\n\nWith careful planning and zoning, structures can be kept out of locations that are vulnerable to landslides or erosion. In order to do this, certain regions could need to be declared no-build zones or high-risk areas might need to use special construction methods.\n\nConclusion\n\nDue to the slow progression and regional nature of ground subsidence, it is simple for people from all walks of life to become unaware of its negative effects, and there is still room for improvement in the general public\u2019s understanding of the significance of ground settlement prevention and treatment.\n\nTo achieve this, we should intensify our public relations and education efforts to better inform the public about the risks that land subsidence poses to the nation\u2019s economy, society, and way-of-life, and to increase the general public\u2019s comprehension of and support measures to prevent and control it.\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S",

Forms mean topographic features or geometric features (relief features) of the earth\u2019s surface.\n\nThe Earth and its Evolution\n\n\u00a0The following are the theories about the origin of the earth\n\nOrigin of Earth\n\nThere are a number of hypotheses regarding the origin of the Earth. Some of them are the following:\n\nNebular Hypothesis \u2013 This theory is developed by Immanuel Kant and later modified by Laplace. The hypothesis considered that the planets were formed out of a cloud of material associated with a youthful sun, which was slowly rotating.\nBinary Hypothesis \u2013 In 1900, Chamberlain and Moulton gave this theory. According to this theory, another wandering star approached the sun. As a result, the material\u2019s cigar-shaped extension from the solar surface was separated.\nIn 1950, Otto Schmidt in Russia and Carl Weizascar in Germany somewhat revised the \u2018nebular hypothesis\u2019, though differing in details. They considered that the sun was surrounded by a solar nebula containing mostly hydrogen and helium along with what may be termed dust.\nModern Theories \u2013 Most accepted argument about the origin of the Universe is the Big Bang Theory and Edwin Hubble provided evidence that the universe is expanding. According to The Big Bang Theory, At the beginning(13.7 Billion years ago) all the matter-forming universe existed in a tiny ball (called singularity) with infinite density. This tiny ball exploded and gradually galaxies and stars were formed.\n\nA galaxy starts to form through the accumulation of hydrogen gas in the form of a very large cloud called a Nebula. These Nebula gave rise to the formation of Stars and later small rounded objects called planetesimals. These large numbers of small bodies accrete to form fewer large bodies in the form of planets.\n\nEvolution of Earth\n\n\u00a0The Earth was mostly in a volatile state during its primordial stage. Due to a gradual increase in density, the temperature inside has increased. As a result, the inside started getting separated depending on their densities. Through the process of differentiation that the earth-forming material got separated into different layers like the crust, mantle, and core.\n\nInterior of the Earth\n\nSources to find out the interior of Earth:\n\nDirect source \u2013 Mining areas, Projects such as \u201cDeep Ocean Drilling Project\u201d, Volcanic eruption, etc.\nIndirect source \u2013 Meteors, gravitation, magnetic field, seismic activities, etc.\n\nFor instance \u2013\n\nEarthquake \u2013 The study of seismic waves provides a complete picture of the layered interior. All natural earthquakes take place in the lithosphere(A portion of depth up to 200 km from the surface of the earth). There are two types of body waves called P waves and S waves.\u00a0 P waves are similar to sound waves and can travel through gaseous, solid, and liquid materials while S waves can travel through only solid states. Hence by the study of these waves, we can understand the interior of Earth.\n\nHence shadow zones of P and S waves tell us that the interior of the earth has different layers with different densities.\n\nStructure of the Earth:\n\nThe earth is made up of the following layers-\n\nLayer\n\t\nThickness and density\n\t\nOther features\n\n\nThe Crust\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Oceanic crust\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Continental Crust\n\n\t\n\u00a0\n\n5 Km. and 2.7g/cm3\n\n\u00a0\n\n30 Km and 3 g/cm3\n\n\t\nOutermost solid part or the earth. The oceanic crust is thinner as compared to the continental layer.\n\nThe oceanic crust is basaltic rock.\n\n\n\nThe Mantle\n\t\n\u00a02900 km. and 3.4g/cm3\n\t\nThe upper portion of the mantle is called the asthenosphere and extends up to 400 km.\n\nThe Crust and uppermost part of the Mantle are called the lithosphere(from 10 km to 200 km).\n\n\n\nThe Core\n\t\n6300 km and 13g/cm3\n\t\nThe earthquake wave velocities helped in understanding the existence of the core of the earth.\n\nThe core is made up of very heavy material mostly composed of nickel and iron.\n\nDistribution of Oceans and Continents\n\n\u00a0Oceans cover around 71% of the earth\u2019s surface and the rest is under continents. The positions of the continents and the ocean bodies, as we see them today, have not been the same in the past.\n\nContinental drift theory\n\u00a0Given by Alfred Wegener in 1912.\nAll continents formed a single continental mass(PANGEA), a mega ocean(PANTHALASSA) surrounded by the same.\nAround 200 million years ago, the supercontinent broke into two large land masses s Laurasia and Gondwanaland.\nSubsequently, These landmasses continued to break into various smaller continents that exist today.\nEvidence includes The matching of continents (Jigsaw fit), Rock of the same age across the oceans, Tillite, Placer deposits etc.\nForce for drifting \u2013 Pole \u2013 fleeing force due to rotation of the earth and tidal force due to the attraction of the Sun and Moon.\nScholars rejected this theory because they considered these forces to be totally inadequate.\nConventional Current Theory\n\u00a0This theory was given by Arthur Holmes in the 1930s.\nThese currents are generated due to radioactive elements causing thermal differences in the mantle portion.\nHolmes argued that there exists a system of such currents in the entire mantle portion.\nThis was an attempt to provide an explanation for the issue of force.\nConcept of Sea Floor spreading\n\nConventional current theory, mapping of the ocean floor, and the concept of Continental drift theory revealed that\n\nAll along the mid-oceanic ridges, volcanic eruptions are common and they bring huge amounts of lava to the surface in this area.\nThe rocks equidistant on either side of the crest of mid-oceanic ridges show remarkable similarities in terms of the period of formation, chemical compositions, and magnetic properties.\nRocks closer to the mid-oceanic ridges have normal polarity and are the youngest. The age of the rocks increases as one moves away from the crest.\nThe ocean rock is much younger than the continental rocks.\nThe deep trenches have deep-seated earthquake occurrences while in the mid-oceanic ridge areas, the quake foci have shallow depths.\n\nThese facts and a detailed analysis of the magnetic properties of the rocks on either side of the mid-oceanic ridge led Hess (1961) to propose his hypothesis, known as the \u201cseafloor spreading\u201d. Hess argued that constant eruptions at the crest of oceanic ridges cause the rupture of the oceanic crust and the new lava wedges into it, pushing the oceanic crust on either side. The ocean floor thus spreads.\n\nPlate tectonics\n\u00a0Given by McKenzie and Parker and also Morgan.\nA tectonic plate (lithospheric Plate) is a massive, irregularly-shaped slab of solid rock, generally composed of both continental and oceanic lithosphere.\nPlates move horizontally over the asthenosphere as rigid units.\nThe theory of plate tectonics proposes that the earth\u2019s lithosphere is divided into seven major and some minor plates.\nThese plates have been constantly moving over the globe throughout the history of the Earth.\nIt is not a continent that moves as believed by Wegener. Continents are part of a plate and what moves is the plate.\nThe mobile rock beneath the rigid plates is believed to be moving in a circular manner. The heated material rises to the surface, spreads and begins to cool, and then sinks back deeper to generate what scientists call a conventional cell.\nHeat within the Earth comes from two main sources \u2013 Radioactive decay and residual heat.\nMinerals and Rocks\n\nThe earth is composed of various kinds of elements. These elements are in solid form in the outer layer of the earth and in hot and molten form in the interior.\n\nMajor Elements of the Earth\u2019s Crust:\n\nThe elements in the earth\u2019s crust are rarely found exclusively but are usually combined with the other elements and such combinations are called Minerals. Eg. Feldspar, Quartz, etc.\n\nRocks\n\nA rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals. There are the following types of rocks \u2013\n\nIGNEOUS ROCKS\n\n\u00a0An igneous rock forms out of magma and lava from the interior of the earth, also known as primary rock.\n\nEg. Granite, Gabbro, Basalts.\n\nSEDIMENTARY ROCKS\n\n\u00a0Rocks (igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic) of the earth\u2019s surface are exposed to denudational agents and are broken up into various sizes of fragments. Such fragments are transported by different exogenous agencies and deposited. These deposits through compaction turn into rocks. This process is called lithification.\n\nEg. Sandstone, coal, limestone, chert, etc.\n\nRead:\u00a0Sedimentary Basins of India\n\nMETAMORPHIC ROCKS\n\n\u00a0These rocks form under the action of pressure, volume, and temperature (PVT) change.\u00a0 Metamorphism occurs when rocks are forced down to lower levels by tectonic processes or when molten magma rising through the crust comes in contact with the crustal rocks or the underlying rocks are subjected to great amounts of pressure by overlying rocks. Metamorphism is a process by which already consolidated rocks undergo recrystallization and reorganization of materials within the original rocks.\n\nEg. Granite, syenite, slate schist, etc.\n\nRocks do not remain in their original form for long but may undergo transformation. The Rock cycle is a process through which old rocks are transformed into new ones.\n\nGeomorphic Process\n\nThe external forces are known as exogenic forces and the internal forces are known as endogenic forces these forces cause physical stresses and chemical actions on earth materials and bring about changes in the configuration of the surface of the earth are known as geomorphic processes.\n\nEndogenic Forces\n\nVarious endogenic forces include:\n\nDiastrophism \u2013 \u00a0All the processes that move, elevate or build up portions of the earth\u2019s crust.\n\nEg. Orogenic Process \u2013 Mountain building\n\nEpeirogenic Process \u2013 Uplift or wrapping of a large part of the earth\u2019s crust\n\nVolcanism\u2013 Volcanism includes the movement of molten rock onto or toward the earth\u2019s surface and also the formation of many intrusive and extrusive volcanic forms.\nExogenic Process\n\nExamples of exogenic processes include weathering, mass movement, erosion, deposition, etc.\n\nAll the exogenic processes are covered under a term called denudation. Denudation means to strip off or to uncover. eg . Mass movements, erosion, etc.\n\nWEATHERING\n\nWeathering is defined as the mechanical disintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks through the actions of various elements of weather and climate.\n\nTypes of weathering \u2013 Chemical, physical and biological weathering.\n\nWeathering processes are responsible for breaking down the rocks into smaller fragments and preparing the way for the formation of not only regolith and soils but also erosion and mass movements.\n\nWeathering is also important for the formation of the soils.\n\nMASS MOVEMENTS \u2013\n\nMass movement is the movement of weathered materials down a slope due to gravitational forces. The movement may be gradual or sudden, depending on the gradient of the slope, the weight of the weathered debris and whether there is any lubricating moisture supplied by rain.\n\nSoil Creep \u2013 a slow gradual but more or less continuous movement of soil down hills.\nSoil flow or Mudflow \u2013 When the soil is completely saturated with water the individual particles are almost suspended in the water and move easily over one another and over the underlying rock.\nLandslides \u2013 The very rapid kind of movement that occurs when a large mass of soil or rock falls suddenly.\n\nMass movements do not come under erosion because these are aided by gravity and no geomorphic agent like running water, glaciers, wind, etc. participates in the process.\n\nLandforms\n\nThe landform is a small to medium-sized part of the surface of the Earth.\n\nEach landform has its own physical shape, size, and materials and is a result of the action of certain geomorphic processes and agents.\n\nThe geomorphic agents(Running water, glaciers, winds, etc.) are capable of erosion and deposition.\n\nLANDFORMS MADE BY RUNNING WATER\n\nThere are two components of running water \u2013\n\nOverland flow on the general land surface as a sheet.\nLinear flow as streams and rivers in valleys.\n\nMost of the erosional landforms made by running water are associated with vigorous and youthful rivers flowing over steep gradients and the gentler the river channels in gradient or slope, the greater the deposition.\n\nErosional landforms\n\t\nDepositional landforms\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Valleys \u2013 Valleys start as small and narrow rills; the rills will gradually develop into long and wide gullies; the gullies will further deepen, widen and lengthen to give rise to valleys. Eg. V-shaped valley, canyon, etc\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Gorge \u2013 It is a deep valley with very steep to straight sides.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 Potholes and Plunge pools \u2013 Potholes are formed because of stream erosion aided by the abrasion of rock fragments.\u00a0 At the foot of waterfalls, large potholes, quite deep and wide, form, and such potholes are called plunge pools.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 Incised or Entrenched Meanders \u2013 They are very deep wide meanders (loop-like channels) found cut in hard rocks.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0 River Terraces \u2013 They result due to vertical erosion by the stream into its own depositional floodplain.\n\n\t\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Alluvial fans \u2013 When the stream moves from the higher level and breaks into a foot slope plain of a low gradient, it loses the energy needed to transport much of its load. Thus, they get dumped and spread as broad low to high cone-shaped deposits called alluvial fans.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Deltas \u2013 Deltas are like alluvial fans but develop along the coast.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 Floodplains \u2013 Large-sized materials are deposited first when a stream channel breaks into a gentle slope. A riverbed made of river deposits is an active floodplain.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 Natural levees\u00a0 \u2013 Natural levees are low, linear, and parallel ridges of coarse deposits along the banks of rivers. When rivers shift laterally, a series of natural levees can form.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0 Point bars \u2013 For large rivers, the sediments are deposited in a linear fashion at the depositional side of a meander.\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Braided Channels \u2013\u00a0 When selective deposition of coarser materials causes the formation of a central bar, it diverts the flow of the river towards the banks, which increases Lateral erosion. Similarly, when more and more such central bars are formed, braided channels are formed.\n\nNote: Meanders \u2013 Meanders are loop-like channel patterns developed over the flood and delta plains. They are actually not a landform but only a type of channel pattern formed as a result of deposition.\n\nAs meanders grow into deep loops, the same may get cut off due to erosion at the inflexion point and are left as oxbow lakes.\n\nLANDFORMS MADE BY GLACIERS\n\n\u00a0A large mass of ice moving very slowly through a valley or spreading outward from a centre is called a glacier. The movement of glaciers is slow, unlike water flow. Erosion by glaciers is tremendous because of friction caused by the sheer weight of the ice.\n\nErosional Landforms\n\t\nDepositional Landforms\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Cirque \u2013 They are deep, long, and wide troughs or basins with very steep concave to vertically dropping high walls at their head as well as sides.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Horns and serrated Ridges \u2013 If three or more radiating glaciers cut headward until their cirques meet, high, sharp-pointed, and steep peaks called horns form.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 Glacial valleys/Troughs \u2013 Very deep glacial troughs filled with seawater and making up shorelines are called fiords.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 Others \u2013 hanging valleys, Bergschrund, etc.\n\n\t\nThe unsorted coarse and fine debris dropped by the melting glaciers is called glacial tills.\n\n1. Marines \u2013 Moraines are long ridges of deposits of glacial till.\n\nDeposits are at the end of a glacier \u2013 Terminal moraines\n\nDeposits on both sides \u2013 Lateral moraines.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Eskers \u2013\u00a0 Eskers are meandering ridges of sediment that form in water channels beneath or within the glacier ice. The floors of these channels can be rock, sediment, or ice.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 Outwash plain \u2013\u00a0 assorted roughly stratified deposits.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 Drumlins \u2013 Drumlins are smooth oval shaped ridge-like features composed mainly of glacial till along with some masses of gravel and sand.\n\nLANDFORMS MADE BY GROUNDWATER\n\n\u00a0The water under the ground flows horizontally through the bedding planes, joints or through the materials themselves. It is this downward and horizontal movement of water that causes the rocks to erode.\n\nAny limestone or dolomite region showing typical landforms produced by the action of groundwater through the process of solution and deposition is called Karst topography.\n\nErosional landforms\n\t\nDepositional Landforms\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Sinkhole \u2013\u00a0 an opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped towards the bottom.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Doline \u2013\u00a0 Some sinkholes collapse due to the presence of some caves or hollows beneath them and become bigger sinkholes.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 Uvalas \u2013 When several sinkholes join together to form a valley of sinks, they are called valley sinks or Uvalas.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 Lapies \u2013\u00a0 the irregular grooves and ridges formed when most of the surfaces of limestone are eaten by the solution process.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0 Caves\n\n\t\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 Stalactites \u2013 It is a deposit of calcium carbonate (such as calcite) resembling an icicle hanging from the roof or sides of a cave.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 It rises up from the floor of the caves.\n\nThe Stalagmites and stalactites eventually fuse to give rise to columns and pillars of different diameters.\n\nLANDFORMS MADE BY WAVES AND CURRENTS\n\n\u00a0Most of the changes along the coasts are accomplished by waves. When waves break, the water is thrown with great force onto the shore, and simultaneously, there is a great churning of sediments on the sea bottom.\n\nHigh Rocky Coasts \u2013 Along these coasts, the river appears to have been drowned with a highly irregular coastline. Shores do not show any depositional landforms initially. Erosion features dominate.\n\nLow Sedimentary Coasts \u2013 Along these coasts the rivers appear to extend their length by building coastal plains and details. Depositional features dominate.\n\nErosional landforms\n\t\nDepositional landforms\n\n\nCliffs, Terraces, Caves, and Stacks \u2013\n\nCliffs are common on the high rocky coasts.\n\nAt the foot of such cliffs, there may be flat or gently sloping platforms covered by rock debris derived from the sea cliff behind.\n\nSuch platforms occurring at an elevation above the average height of waves is called wave-cut terrace.\n\nSometimes, waves create hollows and these hollows get widened and deepened to form Sea Caves.\n\nSea stacks are nothing but the isolated standing rocks in the sea which were once a part of the cliff.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nBar, Barrier, and spit \u2013\n\nA ridge of sand and shingle formed in the sea in the off-shore zone (from the position of low tide waterline to seaward) lying approximately parallel to the coast is called an off-shore bar.\n\nAn off-shore bar that is exposed due to the further addition of sand is termed a barrier bar.\n\nSometimes such barrier bars get keyed up to one end of the bay when they are called spits.\n\nA lagoon is formed when barrier bars and spits form at the mouth of a bay and block it.\n\nOthers \u2013 Dunes, Beaches, etc.\n\nLANDFORMS MADE BY WINDS\n\n\u00a0Winds, particularly in hot deserts, cause deflation, abrasion, and impact. Deflation means the lifting and removal of dust and smaller particles from the surface of rocks.\n\nThe impact is a sheer force of momentum which occurs when sand is blown into or against a rock surface.\n\nAbrasion is the physical process of rubbing, scouring or scraping whereby particles of rock (usually microscopic) are eroded away by friction.\n\nErosional Landforms\n\t\nDepositional Landforms\n\n\nPediplains: When the high relief structures in deserts are reduced to low featureless plains by the activities of wind.\nPlayas: Playa is a flat-bottom depression found in interior desert basins and adjacent to coasts in arid and semiarid regions, periodically covered by water\nDeflation Hollows: Deflation is the removal of loose particles from the ground by the action of wind. When deflation causes a shallow depression by persistent movements of wind, they are called as deflation hollows.\nOthers \u2013 Mushroom, Table and Pedestal Rocks\n\t\nSand dunes: According to the shape of a sand dune, there are varieties of sand dune forms like Barchans, Seifs, etc. The crescent-shaped dunes are called Barchans. They are the most common ones.\nSeif is similar to the Barchans but has only one wing or point.\nLongitudinal dunes form when the supply of sand is poor and wind direction is constant.\nTransverse dunes are aligned perpendicular to the wind direction.\nClimatology\n\nClimatology is the scientific study of climate and how it changes over time is defined as the average weather conditions over time. In climatology, we study topics like- Atmosphere, Heat budget, Jet streams, cyclones, precipitation, etc.\n\nAtmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere can be studied as follows:\n\nComposition of the Atmosphere \u2013\n\nThe atmosphere is composed of gasses, water vapour, and dust particles.\n\nDetails of gasses in the lower atmosphere \u2013\n\nCarbon Dioxide is meteorologically a very important gas as it is transparent to the incoming solar radiation but opaque to the outgoing terrestrial radiation and reflects back some part of it towards the earth\u2019s surface.(Greenhouse effect).\n\nStructure of the Atmosphere\n\nThe structure of the atmosphere is as follows\n\nTROPOSPHERE\nThe lowermost layer of the atmosphere.\nIts average height is 13 km and extends roughly to a height of 8 km near the poles and about 18 km at the equator.\nThis is the most important layer for all biological activity.\nSTRATOSPHERE\nIt extends up to a height of 50 km. It contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere\nWeather-related incidents do not take place in this layer. The air blows horizontally here. Therefore this layer is considered ideal for flying aircraft.\nIt contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere.\nMESOSPHERE\nIt is the third layer of the atmosphere spreading over the stratosphere.\nIt extends up to a height of 80 km.\nTHERMOSPHERE\nThe ionosphere is located between 80 to 400 km above the mesopause.\nRadio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer and due to this, radio broadcasting has become possible.\nThe temperature here starts increasing with height.\n\nThe uppermost layer of the atmosphere is called the Exosphere.\n\nSolar Radiation and Heat Budget\n\n\u00a0The earth\u2019s surface receives most of its energy in short wavelengths and incoming solar radiation is called insolation.\n\nThe amount and intensity of insolation vary during the day, in a season, and in a year.\n\nThe earth after being heated itself becomes a radiating body and it radiates energy to the atmosphere in the long waveform. This energy heats up the atmosphere from below. This process is known as terrestrial radiation.\n\nThe long wave radiation is absorbed by atmospheric gasses, particularly by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. Thus, the atmosphere is indirectly heated by the earth\u2019s radiation.\n\nThe earth as a whole does not accumulate or lose heat. It maintains its temperature. This can happen only if the amount of heat received in the form of insolation equals the amount lost by the earth through terrestrial radiation. This balance between the insolation and the terrestrial radiation is termed the heat budget or heat balance of the earth.\n\nThe albedo of the Earth can be defined as a measure of how much light that hits a surface is reflected back without being absorbed.\n\nTemperature\n\n\u00a0The interaction of insolation with the atmosphere and the earth\u2019s surface creates heat which is measured in the terms of temperature.\n\nFACTORS CONTROLLING TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION\nLatitude\nAltitude\nDistance from the sea\nAir mass and ocean currents\nINVERSION OF TEMPERATURE\n\nWhen the temperature decreases with an increase in elevation are called the normal lapse rate. At times, the situation is reserved and the normal lapse rate is inverted. It is called inversion of temperature. Eg. Sea breeze, land breeze, Fog, etc.\n\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\n\nThe weight of a column of air contained in a unit area from the mean sea level to the top of the atmosphere is called atmospheric pressure.\n\nIn the lower atmosphere, the pressure decreases rapidly with height.\n\nFORCE AFFECTING THE VELOCITY AND DIRECTION OF THE WIND\n\n\u00a0The air in motion is called wind. The wind blows from high pressure to low pressure. Forces \u2013 Gravitational force, Friction force, Pressure Gradient force, Coriolis Force.\n\nThe force exerted by the rotation of the earth is known as the Coriolis force.\n\nThe wind circulation around a low pressure is called cyclonic circulation. Around high pressure, it is called anticyclonic circulation.\n\nGENERAL CIRCULATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE\n\nIt depends on the \u2013\n\nLatitudinal variation of atmospheric heating\nThe emergence of pressure belts\nThe migration of belts following the apparent path of the sun\nThe distribution of continents and oceans\nThe rotation of the earth\n\nThe pattern of the movement of the planetary winds is called the general circulation of the atmosphere.\n\nThe air at the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which lies near the equator, rises due to the heating caused by the reflected radiation from the surface thus creating low pressure.\nThe winds from the tropics (i.e. region around the Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn) flow from their positions towards this low-pressure area. As the air from the tropics reaches the convergence zone it begins to rise because of heating. It reaches an altitude of 14 km and then starts to move towards the poles thus creating the upper air circulation or upper atmospheric circulation.\nWhile travelling towards the poles, as the air of the upper air circulation gets cold and dense, there is accumulation around 30\u00b0 N and S latitudes. Some part of the cold air sinks towards the ground creating a subtropical high.\nAs it reaches the surface, the wind again starts moving towards the ITCZ near the equator and becomes known as easterlies. This cycle of air circulation in between the Equator and the Tropics is known as the Hadley Cell.\nThe cycle of the air in between the mid-latitudes (i.e. around the tropics) and the poles is known as the mid-latitude cell or Ferrel cell. In this case, the rising warmer air) is coming from the subtropical high and the sinking cool air is coming from the poles. Such winds near the surface are known as\nThe cycle of air circulation in-between the poles and the mid-latitudes is known as the Polar cell.\n\u00a0Air Masses\n\nWhen the air remains over a homogenous area for a sufficiently long time, it acquires the characteristics of the area.\n\nThe air masses are classified according to the source regions-\n\nWarm tropical and subtropical oceans\nThe subtropical hot deserts\nThe relatively cold high-latitude oceans\nThe very cold snow-covered continents in the Arctic and Antarctica\nTYPES \u2013\nMaritime tropical\nContinental tropical\nMaritime polar\nContinental polar\nContinental arctic\nFronts\n\nWhen two different air masses meet, the boundary zone between them is called Fronts by the process of frontogenesis.\n\nTypes of fronts \u2013\n\nCold\nWarm\nStationary\nOccluded\nExtra-Tropical Cyclones\n\nTemperate cyclones are also known as Extra-tropical cyclones where the term \u201cExtra-tropical\u201d signifies that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside the tropics with a latitude range between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. They are low-pressure systems with associated cold fronts, warm fronts, and occluded fronts. These cyclones are formed along the polar front. In the beginning, the front is stationary. These cyclones move from west to east.\n\nTropical Cyclones\n\nTropical cyclones are violent storms that originate over oceans in tropical areas and move over coastal areas and move over to the coastal areas bringing about large-scale destruction caused by violent winds, very heavy rainfall and storm surges.\n\nConditions:\n\nLarge sea surface with a temperature higher than 270 C\nPresence of the Coriolis force\nSmall variations in the vertical wind speed\nA pre-existing weak-low-pressure area or low-level cyclonic circulation\nUpper divergence above the sea level system\n\nA mature tropical cyclone is characterized by the strong spirally circulating wind around the centre, called the Eye.\n\nThe Cyclone creates storm surges and they inundate the coastal lowlands. The storm peters out on the land.\n\nJet streams\n\nAccording to World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), \u201ca strong narrow current concentrated along a quasi-horizontal axis in the upper troposphere or the stratosphere characterized by strong vertical and lateral wind shear and featuring one or more velocity maxima is called the jet stream.\u201d\n\nWater in The Atmosphere\n\nThe following are the properties of water in the atmosphere.\n\nEvaporation and Condensation\nThe water vapour in the air is known as humidity and the actual amount of water vapour present in the atmosphere is known as the absolute humidity. The percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere as compared to its full capacity at a given temperature is known as relative humidity.\nThe amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is added or withdrawn due to evaporation and condensation respectively. Evaporation is the process by which water is transformed from liquid to a gaseous state. The transformation of water vapour into water is called condensation.\nDew- When the moisture is deposited in the form of water droplets on cooler surfaces of solid objects (rather than nuclei in the air above the surface) such as stones, grass blades and plant leaves, it is known as dew.\nFrost \u2013 Frost forms on cold surfaces when condensation takes place below the freezing point (00C), i.e. the dew point is at or below the freezing point.\nFog \u2013 When the temperature of an air mass containing a large quantity of water vapour falls. All of a sudden, condensation takes place within itself on fine dust particles. So, the fog is a cloud with its base at or very near the ground.\nClouds\n\nA cloud is a mass of water drops or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Clouds form when water condenses in the sky. The condensation lets us see the water vapour. There are many different types of clouds \u2013 Cirrus, Cumulus, Stratus, Nimbus, etc.\n\nA combination of these four basic types of clouds can be again divided into three types:\n\nHigh clouds- Cirrus, cirrostratus etc.\nMiddle clouds \u2013 Altostratus, altocumulus; etc\nLow clouds \u2013 Stratocumulus and nimbostratus.\nPrecipitation\n\nThe process of continuous condensation in free air helps the condensed particles to grow in size. When the resistance of the air fails to hold them against the force of gravity, they fall onto the earth\u2019s surface. So after the condensation of water vapour, the release of moisture is known as precipitation.\n\nSleet is frozen raindrops and refrozen melted snow water. When a layer of air with a temperature above freezing point overlies a sub-freezing layer near the ground, precipitation takes place in the form of sleet. Raindrops, which leave the warmer air, encounter the colder air below.\n\nTypes of Rainfall\n\nThe following are the various types of rainfalls:\n\nCONVECTIONAL RAINFALL\n\nThe air getting heated becomes light and rises in convection currents.\n\nAs the air rises, it expands and drops the temperature and subsequently, condensation takes place and cumulus clouds are formed.\n\nThis type of rainfall generally takes place in the equatorial regions and internal parts of the continents, predominantly in the northern hemisphere.\n\nOROGRAPHIC RAIN\n\nWhen the saturated air mass comes across a mountain, it is forced to ascend and as it rises, it expands; the temperature falls, and the moisture is condensed. The chief characteristic of this sort of rain is that the windward slopes receive greater rainfall.\n\nThe area situated on the leeward side, which gets less rainfall is known as the rain-shadow area. It is also known as the relief rain.\n\nCYCLONIC RAIN\n\nCyclonic activity causes cyclonic rain and it occurs along the fronts of the cyclone. As the warm air rises, it cools, and the moisture present in it condenses to form clouds. This rain falls gradually for a few hours to a few days.\n\nWorld Climate and Climate Change\n\nThe world climate is classified based on the scheme developed by V. Koeppen. He identified a close relationship between the distribution of vegetation and climate.\n\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.\n\nOceanography\n\nOceanography is a scientific discipline concerned with all aspects of the world\u2019s oceans and seas, including their physical and chemical properties, their origin and geologic framework, and the life forms that inhabit the marine environment.\n\nIn Oceanography, we learn about Hydrological cycles, Currents, waves, tides, marine life such as coral life, major and minor relief features, etc.\n\nHydrological Cycle\n\nWater can be used and reused. Water undergoes a cycle from the ocean to land and land to ocean. The hydrological cycle is the circulation of water within the earth\u2019s Hydrosphere in different forms.\n\nRelief of Ocean Floor\n\nThe floors of the oceans are rugged with the world\u2019s largest mountain ranges, deepest trenches and the largest plains.\n\nThe oceanic part can be divided into \u2013 Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Arctic.\n\nDivisions of The Ocean Floors \u2013\nThe Continental shelf \u2013 It is the shallowest part of the ocean showing an average gradient of 1\u00b0 or even less. The shelf typically ends at a very steep slope, called the shelf break. The continental shelves are covered with variable thicknesses of sediments brought down by rivers, glaciers, and wind, from the land and distributed by waves and currents. Massive sedimentary deposits received over a long time by the continental shelves become the source of fossil fuels.\nThe continental Slope \u2013 The continental slope connects the continental shelf and the ocean basins.\nThe deep sea Plain- Deep sea plains are gently sloping areas of the ocean basins. These are the flattest and smoothest regions of the world.\nThe oceanic Deep- These areas are the deepest parts of the oceans. The trenches are relatively steep-sided, narrow basins.\nOther Relief-\n\n\u00a0The various other relief features are:\n\nMid oceanic Ridge \u2013 It is composed of two chains of mountains separated by a large depression. Eg. Atlantic Ridge\nSeamount \u2013 It is a mountain with pointed summits, rising from the seafloor that does not reach the surface of the ocean. Seamounts are volcanic in origin.\nGuyots \u2013 It is a flat-topped seamount. They show evidence of gradual subsidence through stages to become flat-topped submerged mountains.\nAtolls \u2013 These are low islands found in the tropical oceans consisting of coral reefs surrounding a central depression. It may be a part of the sea (lagoon), or sometimes form enclosing a body of fresh, brackish, or highly saline water.\nThe temperature of Ocean Waters\n\nFactors Affecting \u2013\n\nLatitude\nUnequal distribution of land and water\nPrevailing wind\nOcean currents\nThe salinity of oceanic water\n\nHorizontal and vertical Distribution of Temperature \u2013\n\nTemperature decreases with the increased depth.\nThe boundary region( 100-400 m), from where there is a rapid decrease in temperature, is called the thermocline.\nBelow the thermocline, the Temperature changes very slightly.\nThe average temperature of surface water is about 270\nIt gradually decreases from the equator towards the poles.\nThe oceans in the northern hemisphere record relatively higher temperatures than in the southern hemisphere.\nSALINITY IN THE OCEAN WATER\n\n\u00a0The total content of dissolved salts in seawater is termed Salinity.\n\nA salinity of 24.7 %0 has been regarded as the upper limit to fix \u2018brackish water\u2019\n\nFactors affecting Oceanic salinity \u2013\n\nDepend upon evaporation and precipitation.\nInfluenced by freshwater flow from rivers in coastal regions.\nWInd\nOcean currents\nHorizontal and vertical\u00a0 distribution of salinity\n\u00a0The salinity of a normal open sea \u2013 is between 33 to 37.\nIn estuaries and the Arctic sea, it fluctuates between 0 to 35.\nIn the hot and dry regions where the evaporation of water is high, it may reach 70.\nIn landlocked countries such as the Red sea, it is recorded 41 due to higher evaporation.\nIn the Indian Ocean the average salinity \u2013\nSalinity at the surface decreases by freshwater input or increases by loss of water to evaporation and Ice.\nSalinity in the depth is very much fixed as there is no water added or lost.\nSalinity generally increases with an increase in depth.\nThere is a distinct zone called Halocline, in this zone, there is a sharp increase in salinity.\nMovements of Ocean Water\n\nThe movements of ocean water can be horizontal or vertical. The horizontal motion of oceanic water refers to the ocean currents and waves while vertical motion refers to tides.\n\nWAVES\n\nWaves are formed by energy passing through water, resulting in it moving in a circular motion. Water particles travel only in a small circle as a wave passes. The Wind causes waves to travel in the ocean and the energy is released on coastlines. When the depth of water is less than half the wavelength of the wave, the wave breaks.\n\nA wave\u2019s size and shape reveal its origin. Steep waves are fairly young ones and are probably formed by local wind. Slow and steady waves originate from faraway places, possibly from another hemisphere.\n\nWaves travel because the wind pushes the water body in its course while gravity pulls the crests of the waves downward.\n\nOCEAN CURRENTS\n\nOcean currents are rivers in the oceans and represent a regular volume of water in a definite path and direction. The strength of the Current refers to the speed of the current.\n\nForces that influence currents \u2013\n\nHeating by solar energy\nGravity\nWind\nCoriolis force\nThe difference in water density\nTYPES OF OCEAN CURRENT\nSurface currents \u2013 constitute about 10% of all the water in the ocean. These waters are the upper 400m of the ocean. They can be divided into \u2013\nCold currents \u2013 bring cold water into warm water areas. They are usually found on the west coast of the continents in low and middle latitudes. Eg. Peruvian current, Labrador current etc\nWarm Currents \u2013 Bring warm water into cold water areas and are usually observed on the east coast of constituents in the low and middle latitudes. Eg. Brazilian Current, Agulhas Current etc.\nDeep Water currents \u2013 make up the other 90% of the ocean Water.\nTIDES\n\nThe periodical rise and fall of the sea level once or twice a day, mainly due to the attraction of the sun and moon,is called a tide.\n\nFactors \u2013\n\nThe gravitational pull of the sun and moon\nCentrifugal force\n\nThe tide-generating force is the difference between these two forces \u2013 The gravitational attraction of the moon and the centrifugal force.\n\nTYPES OF TIDES\n\nThe height of rising water varies appreciably depending upon the position of the sun and moon with respect to the earth.\n\nSpring tides \u2013 When the sun, the moon and the Earth are in a straight line \u2013 Tide will be higher.\n\nThey occur twice a month, one during the full period and another during the new moon period.\n\nNeap tides- Sun and moon are perpendicular to each other.\n\nThe forces of the sun and moon tend to counter one another.\n\nTide will be low.\n\nTidal flows are of great importance in navigation. These tides are also helpful in desilting the sediments and in removing polluted water from river estuaries.\n\nIslands and Coral Reefs\n\n\u00a0An island is a piece of land surrounded on the sides by water.\n\nTypes of Islands\nContinental Islands \u2013 These islands were formerly part of the mainland and are now detached from the continent. They may be separated by a shallow lagoon or a deep channel.\n\nEg. Madagascar, Formosa etc\n\nOceanic Islands \u2013 These islands are normally small and are located in the midst of oceans.\nMauna Loa in Hawaii, Volcanic islands such as the Canary islands\nCoral reefs\n\nThey are very tiny creatures with the ability to secrete calcium carbonate within their cells has given rise to a particular type of landform.\n\nFavourable conditions corals survive \u2013\n\nWater Temperature \u2013 Not below 200C\nArea \u2013 Tropical and subtropical zones\nShallow water area\nSaltish and free from sediment water\n\nThere are different types of coral reefs such as Fringing Reefs, Barrier Reefs and Atolls.\n\nSoil Formation\n\nSoil is a dynamic medium in which many chemical, physical and biological activities going on constantly. Soil can be defined as \u2013 a collection of natural bodies on the earth\u2019s surface containing living matter and supporting or capable of supporting plants.\n\nProcess of Soil Formation\nA precondition for soil formation is weathering. It is a weathering mantle which is the basic input for soil to form.\nThe weathered material or transported deposits are colonized by bacteria and other inferior plants.\nThe dead remains of organisms and plants help in humus accumulation.\nMinor grasses and ferns may grow in starting and later big plants and trees.\nPlants\u2019 roots penetrate down, burrowing animals bring up particles, and the mass of material becomes porous and sponge-like with a capacity to retain water and to permit the passage of air and finally a mature soil.\nSoil forming factors\nParent material \u2013 a passive control factor and soil formation depend upon the texture and structure.\nTopography \u2013 a passive control factor. The amount of exposure of a surface covered by parent materials to sunlight etc. depends on topography.\nClimate \u2013 an active control factor. Factors such as precipitation, moisture in the soil, temperature, etc. play a major role in soil formation.\nBiological Activity \u2013 The vegetative cover and organisms that occupy the parent materials from the beginning and also at later stages help in adding organic matter and moisture retention, nitrogen etc\nTime \u2013 The length of time the soil-forming processes operate, determines the maturation of soils and profile development.\nSalient features of the world\u2019s physical geography: Examples\n\nThe world\u2019s physical geography is characterized by a wide diversity of landforms, climates, and ecosystems. Some of the most salient features of the world geography include:\n\nOceans and seas: The Earth is mostly covered by water, with the Pacific Ocean being the largest. There are five main oceans on Earth: the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean. These oceans are connected by a network of smaller seas, straits, and channels.\nContinents: The Earth\u2019s land is divided into seven continents: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and South America.\nMountains: Some of the world\u2019s most iconic mountain ranges include the Himalayas, the Andes, the Rockies, the Alps, and the Karakoram.\nPlateaus and uplands: Major plateaus include the Tibetan Plateau and the Deccan Plateau.\nPlains and lowlands: Major lowlands include the Amazon River Basin, the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the Mississippi River Valley, and the European Lowlands.\nDeserts: Major deserts include the Sahara, the Arabian Desert, the Gobi Desert, and the Atacama Desert.\nRainforests: The world\u2019s largest rainforests are found in the Amazon and Congo Basins, as well as in Indonesia and Malaysia.\nOceans currents and winds: The ocean currents and winds are major drivers of the Earth\u2019s climate, helping to distribute heat and moisture around the globe.\nRivers and lakes: Some of the world\u2019s longest rivers include the Nile, the Amazon, the Yangtze, and the Mississippi. Some of the largest lakes include the Caspian Sea, Lake Superior, and Lake Victoria.\nGlaciers and ice caps: Some of the world\u2019s most iconic glaciers and ice caps include those in Antarctica, Greenland, and the Canadian Arctic.\n\nThe study of physical Geography is essential for the sufficient allocation of natural resources on the earth. It is essential for enabling human resolution as per the adjacent conditions and to be improved in order to protect our planet earth.\n\nArticle written by -Ankit Sharma",

earthquake event)\nvolcanic eruptions, lahars, and ash fall.\n\nAlso read: Geomorphic Processes and Earth Movements\n\nGeohazard management in India\n\nIndia is home to more than 17% of the world\u2019s population despite having only 2% of the planet\u2019s total land area.\n\nThe country experiences a variety of geohazards, including earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, glacial lake outburst floods, landslide-dammed lake outburst floods, etc., that negatively impact life, the economy, and the environment.\nVarious calamities, which also result in the deaths of thousands of people, cost the economy on average 2% of its gross domestic product and 12% of its income each year.\n\n59% of the earth\u2019s surface is impacted by earthquakes, and seismic intensities of VII, VIII, and IX are possible in seismic zones III, IV, and V, respectively.\n\nIn addition to being very susceptible to earthquakes, the Himalayan belt in the country\u2019s north is also dynamically active, climatically sensitive, and vulnerable to landslides and flash floods.\n\nThe frequencies and effects of these geohazards are growing as a result of changing climatic conditions, expanding population, and dangerous development and urbanization practices.\n\nThe national disaster management authority in India has made efforts to evaluate the types and severity of these disasters that have previously affected the nation and identified potential risks to various vulnerable elements based on inputs from various sectors and disciplines.\n\nProfessional geologists and engineers have made significant contributions to improving our understanding of geohazards and developing practical solutions for more secure, sustainable development.\n\nIn 2021 the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways entered into an MoU with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to strengthen cooperation in sustainable geohazard management.\n\nThe Ministry and DRDO had agreed to work together in areas that would be beneficial to both parties, such as conceptual planning of integrated avalanche/landslide protection schemes or all-weather connectivity in our country\u2019s snowy regions, including the preliminary feasibility of tunnels and viaducts.\nAdditionally, they agreed to work together on the planning and construction of various avalanche and landslide control structures, as well as on the creation of tunnel proposals and project reports.\nThis effort was designed to protect users of the nation\u2019s national highways from the damaging impacts of landslides and other natural disasters.\nWith an emphasis on terrains and avalanches, the Defence Geo Informatics Research Establishment (DGRE), a DRDO laboratory, is the pioneer in the creation of vital technologies for boosting combat effectiveness.\nMap-making, forecasting, monitoring, controlling, and mitigating landslides and avalanches in the Himalayan terrain are all part of its responsibilities and mandate.\nBoth organizations had agreed to employ DRDO\u2019s knowledge through DGRE to provide long-term solutions to damage brought on by landslides, avalanches, and other natural disasters on different national highways across the nation.\n\nThe integration of disaster risk reduction and development has been a focus of national-level policy, guidelines, plans, programs, initiatives, and procedures as well as regulatory measures focused on technical, administrative, financial, legal, and sociocultural issues.\n\nGeohazard risk reduction- UNESCO\n\nUNESCO\u2019s work on Geohazard Risk Reduction operates by the four Priorities for Action of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030:\n\nUnderstanding disaster risk\nStrengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk\nInvesting in disaster risk reduction for resilience\nEnhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and Build Back Better in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.\nGeological hazard mitigation\n\nGeotechnical engineers work to avoid or lessen issues brought on by geohazards. Geological Hazards Mitigation is the application of geological engineering principles to minimize or prevent the effects of naturally occurring geologic hazards.\n\nA risk assessment and analysis of natural and artificial systems in urban and coastal zones are necessary to successfully defend geotechnical engineering projects that are likely to be endangered by geohazards.\nGeotechnical engineers may precisely ascertain the material characteristics of geomaterials including soils, rocks, minerals, and concrete through site investigations and afterward evaluate the potential risk they offer to people, property, and the environment.\nRisk reduction technologies that are based on the detection, analysis, and assessment of possible geohazards must be developed because geohazards cannot be discovered until they occur.\nTherefore, improving safety risk assessment and management approaches as well as creating tools and processes to quantify the uncertainties of geomaterials is of utmost importance.\nWay forward\n\nGeohazards are increasing across the globe due to climate change and increase the risk of long-term disruption to transport systems. A reliable and efficient transport system/network is a major catalyst for the development of a country and the backbone of its functioning.\n\nDisruption of the transport system will cause economic setbacks and impact citizens\u2019 security and access to critical infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, or shelters.\n\nTherefore, a geohazard risk management perspective that incorporates people, the environment, hydrology, geology, and transportation infrastructure needs to be adopted for a robust and resilient transport network.\n\nThe traditional approach to maintaining a transport network is reactive and remediates geohazard events as they occur. A proactive approach that evaluates hazards, monitors the network and manages the infrastructure can result in 60-80% life-cycle cost savings.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

    "[CONTENT] #258": "What is a heat dome? Is heat dome and heat wave are same? How were they formed? What are the impacts of heat dome? Read further to know more.\n\nOver the New Year\u2019s holiday, a number of regions of Europe experienced an unusual winter heat wave. Ten to twenty degrees Celsius above average temperatures were recorded. Due to the development of a heat dome over the area, the continent is currently going through an extremely warm period.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a heat dome happens when the atmosphere traps hot ocean air like a lid or cap.\n\nWhen the waters of the eastern and western Pacific are both warm, a heat dome is more likely to form during La Nia years.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Heat Dome?\nAre Heat Domes and Heat Waves the Same?\nHeat Domes and Jet Stream\nWhat are The Causes of the Formation of Heat Domes?\nHow Do Heat Domes Impact Humans?\nWhat Are The Effects Of Heat Dome?\nWhat Are The Steps to Avoid?\nWay Forward\nWhat is Heat Dome?\n\nA heat dome is a high-pressure weather pattern that can cause extreme heat and humidity. It is a type of atmospheric circulation that is characterized by a dome or ridge of high pressure aloft, with descending air at the surface.\n\nThis sinking air can lead to clear skies and very hot temperatures, as the air becomes compressed and warms as it sinks. It can also cause drought conditions, as the sinking air suppresses the development of clouds and precipitation.\n\nA heat dome forms when warm air is trapped over a region for a long time, much like a pot lid. Every day that passes brings warmer conditions because the sun works harder to heat the air the longer it is trapped.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHeat domes typically last a few days, but they occasionally last for up to weeks, which could result in deadly heat waves.\n\nScientists contend that air is forced to sink in any area of high pressure, whether or not it is a heat dome. Once the air reaches the ground, it is compressed and becomes even hotter.\n\nAdditionally, as air sinks, it becomes drier, pushing the temperature of the area even higher.\n\nThese are often associated with extreme heat waves and can be dangerous to people, especially those who are sensitive to heat or have certain medical conditions.\n\nAre Heat Domes and Heat Waves the Same?\n\nHeat domes and heat waves are related, but they are not the same thing. A heat dome is a weather pattern characterized by a high-pressure system aloft and sinking air at the surface. This can lead to clear skies and very hot temperatures.\n\nA heat wave, on the other hand, is a prolonged period of excessively hot weather. The definition of a heat wave can vary depending on the region and the time of year, but it generally refers to a period of several days during which the temperature is significantly higher than the average temperature for that time of year.\n\nHeat waves can be caused by a variety of weather patterns, including heat domes, but they can also be caused by other factors such as a strong ridge of high pressure or a lack of cloud cover.\n\nHeat Domes and Jet Stream\n\nThe jet stream is a strong, fast-flowing wind current that typically blows in the upper levels of the atmosphere. It is found at the boundary between cold air to the north and warm air to the south, and it typically flows from west to east.\n\nThe jet stream is an important factor in the formation and movement of weather systems, and it can influence temperature, precipitation, and other weather conditions.\n\nHeat domes are often associated with a strong, broad ridge of high pressure in the upper atmosphere, which can cause the jet stream to become \u201cstuck\u201d or slowed down. When this happens, the jet stream can be deflected north or south, leading to a persistent weather pattern that can last for several days or even weeks.\n\nIn the case of a heat dome, the jet stream may be deflected northward, allowing warm, humid air to flow into the region and leading to hot and potentially dangerous conditions.\n\nWhat are The Causes of the Formation of Heat Domes?\n\nHeat domes can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\nA strong, broad ridge of high pressure aloft: When a high-pressure system is particularly strong and covers a large area, it can create a \u201cdome\u201d of sinking air at the surface. This sinking air can lead to clear skies and very hot temperatures.\nA lack of cloud cover: It can also form when there is a lack of cloud cover, as clouds can help to keep temperatures cooler by reflecting sunlight back into space and by releasing heat through the process of evaporation.\nWarm, moist air: This is often associated with warm, moist air, as the humidity can make the air feel even hotter.\nA lack of wind: When the wind is light or calm, it can allow heat to build up at the surface, leading to the formation of a heat dome.\nClimate change: Some research suggests that heat domes may be becoming more common and more intense due to climate change, as rising temperatures can create conditions that are more conducive to heat dome formation.\nHow Do Heat Domes Impact Humans?\n\nHeat domes can have significant impacts on humans, as they can lead to extreme heat and humidity. Exposure to extreme heat can be dangerous, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and people with certain medical conditions.\n\nHeat exhaustion and heat stroke are common health problems that can result from prolonged exposure to extreme heat.\n\nDizziness, fatigue, and headaches are some of the symptoms of heat exhaustion, a condition where the body becomes dehydrated and overheated. When the body\u2019s temperature regulation system is overworked, a more serious condition known as heat stroke develops. If it is not treated quickly, heat stroke can be fatal.\n\nIn addition to the health impacts, heat domes can also lead to other problems such as power outages, due to the increased demand for air conditioning, and decreased air quality due to the buildup of pollutants. It can also have impacts on agriculture, as extreme heat and drought conditions can damage crops.\n\nWhat Are The Effects Of Heat Dome?\n\nThis can have a variety of effects, including:\n\nExtreme heat and humidity: Heat domes are characterized by very hot temperatures and high humidity, which can make the air feel even hotter.\nClear skies: Heat domes often result in clear skies, as the sinking air suppresses the development of clouds and precipitation.\nDrought conditions: The sinking air associated with heat domes can also lead to drought conditions, as it suppresses the development of clouds and precipitation.\nHealth impacts: Prolonged exposure to extreme heat and humidity can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which can be dangerous, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and people with certain medical conditions.\nPower outages: The increased demand for air conditioning during heat domes can lead to power outages.\nDecreased air quality: The build-up of pollutants during heat domes can lead to decreased air quality.\nAgricultural impacts: Extreme heat and drought conditions can damage crops and have other impacts on agriculture.\n\nHeat domes can also have other impacts, depending on the specific region and the weather conditions associated with the heat dome.\n\nWhat Are The Steps to Avoid?\n\nThere are several steps that you can take to avoid heat domes and stay safe during extreme heat:\n\nStay indoors in air-conditioned places: The best way to avoid heat is to stay inside in an air-conditioned environment. This can help to keep you cool and reduce your risk of heat-related illness.\nStay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, even if you do not feel thirsty. Avoid drinks that contain alcohol or caffeine, as they can increase your risk of dehydration.\nWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing: Wearing loose, lightweight clothing can help to keep you cooler, as it allows air to circulate around your body. Light-coloured clothing can also help to reflect sunlight and heat.\nUse fans and other cooling devices: Fans and other cooling devices can help to keep you comfortable, but they are not as effective at cooling the body as air conditioning.\nTake frequent breaks: If you must be outside during a heat dome, take frequent breaks in a cool, air-conditioned place. Avoid strenuous activity during the hottest part of the day, and try to do any outdoor work in the early morning or late evening when it is cooler.\nCheck on vulnerable individuals: Check on elderly neighbours, friends, and family members regularly to make sure they are staying cool and hydrated.\nKnow the symptoms of heat-related illness: If you or someone you know experiences symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, headache, or muscle cramps, seek medical attention immediately. These can be signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke, which can be serious and potentially life-threatening if not treated promptly.\nWay Forward\n\nThere are several steps that can be taken to address the issue of heat domes and their impacts:\n\nIncrease awareness: Educating the public about the dangers of heat domes and the steps that can be taken to stay safe during extreme heat can help to reduce the number of heat-related illnesses and deaths.\nImprove infrastructure: Ensuring that buildings and homes are well-insulated and equipped with air conditioning can help to reduce the impacts of heat domes.\nDevelop early warning systems: Establishing early warning systems that can alert people to the onset of a heat dome and provide information on how to stay safe can help to reduce the number of heat-related illnesses and deaths.\nIncrease green spaces: Increasing the amount of green space in urban areas can help to reduce the heat island effect, as trees and other vegetation can help to cool the air and reduce the temperature.\nAddress climate change: Climate change is a major factor in the formation and intensity of heat domes, and addressing the root cause of climate change can help to reduce the frequency and severity of heat domes in the future.\nEnhance emergency response: Improving emergency response systems and increasing the capacity of hospitals and other medical facilities can help to ensure that people who are affected by heat domes receive the care that they need.\n\nArticle written by: Remya",

There is no distinct winter climate in this area.\nIn some areas of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the temperature frequently reaches 30 degrees.\nThe north has distinct winter weather with an average temperature below 21\u00b0C.\nThe Gangetic plains have a mean minimum temperature of about 10\u00b0C, compared to a mean minimum of about 5\u00b0C in north-western India.\nIndia\u2019s coldest place is the Dras Valley in Kashmir. The lowest temperature ever at Dras was -45\u00b0C in 1908.\nPressure During the Winter\nHigh air pressure is present across a significant portion of north-western India due to low temperatures and divergence caused by the STJ (SubTropical Jet Streams) ridge.\nThe pressure in South India is lower than it is in the rest of the nation.\nFrom a north-westerly high-pressure area to a south-easterly low-pressure area, the winds start to blow.\nThe low-pressure gradient and low wind velocity are related.\nThe pressure gradient and physiography determine the wind\u2019s route.\nWestern Upheavals during the Winter\nIn northwest and northern India, the arrival of western disturbances frequently interrupts a period of favorable weather.\nIn Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana, they intensify.\nThey go through the sub-Himalayan belt in an easterly direction, eventually arriving in Arunachal Pradesh.\nThey produce modest rain in the Indus Ganga lowlands and snow in the Himalayan region.\nAfter the disturbance passed, extensive fog and cold waves arrived and caused the minimum temperature to drop by 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0C.\nVisibility is drastically reduced by fog, which is very problematic when traveling.\n\nAlso read: Unseasonal Rains in India\n\nTropical cyclones during the winter\nDuring this time of year, tropical cyclone activity is at its lowest.\nThe low sea surface temperature and the ITCZ\u2019s furthest south egress are to blame for this ( Intertropical Convergence Zone).\nTamil Nadu is battered by storms with origins in the Bay of Bengal, which produce a lot of rain.\nFrom the southern peninsula, some of them span the Arabian Sea.\nThere aren\u2019t many storms that develop in the Arabian Sea and move north or west.\nPrecipitation in Winter Season\nThe receding winter monsoons take up moisture while crossing the Bay of Bengal, resulting in winter rainfall in Tamil Nadu, south Andhra Pradesh, south-east Karnataka, and south-east Kerala (Usually in the first weeks of November).\nThe largest seasonal rainfall of roughly 75 cm occurs between October and December.\nThe majority of it takes place in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s surrounding regions and along the southern coast of Tamil Nadu.

Very High Vulnerability Zone\n\nThis zone includes the Himalayas, Andaman, and Nicobar, high rainfall regions with steep slopes in the Western Ghats and Nilgiris, the northeastern regions, along with regions that frequently experience ground shaking due to earthquakes, etc. It also includes regions that have a high concentration of human activity, especially that related to building roads, dams, etc.\n\n2. High Vulnerability Zone\n\nThis group also includes areas with almost identical conditions to those found in the very high vulnerability zone. The only difference between these two is how the governing factors are integrated, how intensely, and how frequently they occur. Except for the Assam plains, all of the Himalayan states and those from the northeastern areas are included in the high vulnerability zones.\n\n3. Moderate to Low Vulnerability Zone\n\nAreas that receive less precipitation such as TransHimalayan areas of Ladakh and Spiti (Himachal Pradesh), undulated yet stable relief and low precipitation areas in the Aravali, rain shadow areas in the Western and Eastern Ghats and Deccan plateau also experiences occasional landslides. The states of Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Goa, and Kerala are those where subsidence and mining-related landslides occur most frequently.\n\nA Case Study\n\nA significant landslide damaged a 200-meter section of the historic Hindustan-Tibet road, National Highway 22 when it hit the Pangi village near Reckong Peo in the Kinnaur region of Himachal Pradesh. The intense blasting at Pangi village caused this landslide. The blasting caused this slope\u2019s weak spot to collapse, severely damaging the road and the nearby villages.\n\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n\nAs per the Disaster Management Act, of 2005 the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), a statutory and apex body under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister, is mandated to lay down the policies, plans, and guidelines for disaster management to ensure a timely and effective response to disasters.\n\nNational Landslide Risk Management Strategy\n\nA Task Force of Experts has been made for the formulation of a National Landslide Risk Management Strategy. The Task Force comprised of six Sub-Groups of experts addressing different components of landslide disaster risk reduction.\n\nThe Task Force was divided into six Sub-Groups as under:-\n\nSub-Group I: Generation of User-Friendly Landslide Hazard Maps\nSub-Group II: Development of Landslide Monitoring and Early Warning System\nSub-Group III: Awareness Programmes\nSub-Group IV: Capacity Building and Training of Stakeholders\nSub-Group V: Preparation of Mountain Zone Regulations & Policies\nSub-Group VI: Stabilization and Mitigation of Landslides and Creation of Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for Landslide Management\nCauses of Landslides\n\nLandslides can be triggered by both natural and anthropogenic means.\n\nNatural Causes of Landslide\n\nClimate: Soil stability may be significantly impacted by long-term climatic changes.\n\nEarthquakes: Seismic activities have, for a long time, contributed to landslides across the globe. Any moment tectonic plates move, the soil covering them also moves along.\n\nWeathering: Weathering is the natural procedure of rock deterioration that leads to weak, landslide-susceptive materials.\n\nErosion: Slope support is destroyed by erosion brought on by sporadic running water, such as streams, rivers, wind, currents, ice, and waves, which makes landslides more likely to happen.\n\nVolcanoes: Volcanic eruptions can trigger landslides. The stratovolcano is a typical example of a volcano responsible for most landslides across the globe.\n\nHuman causes of landslides\n\nMining: Landslides are greatly amplified by mining activities that use blasting techniques. The explosives\u2019 vibrations have the potential to damage the soil in other regions prone to landslides.\n\nTimber Harvesting: Clearcutting is a method of harvesting timber that involves cutting all old trees from the area. This method is hazardous since it completely destroys the local mechanical root system.\n\nEffects of Landslides\n\nImpact on the Economy: Landslide causes destruction of the property. Its rehabilitation and rebuilding cost millions.\n\nDamages to infrastructure: The force flow of mud, debris, and rocks as a result of a landslide can cause serious damage to personal property and other significant infrastructures such as roads, railways, leisure destinations, buildings, and communication systems.\n\nLoss of life: Communities living at the foot of hills and mountains are at greater risk of landslides. Most of the disaster-prone areas are highly populated which makes lives more miserable.\n\nAffects the beauty of landscapes: The flow of mud, rock, and debris disturbs the natural sight or beauty of a place.\n\nDecline river ecosystems: The substances landslide carries with themselves block or hinder their natural flow. It causes a serious impact on many river habitats like fish as they can die due to interference with the natural flow of water.\n\nTrigger Flood: It can lead to the diversion of river water that can lead to flood in areas and loss of properties as well.\n\nImpact on Livelihood: Communities depending on the river water or coasts for household activities, livelihood, and irrigation will suffer from it.\n\nAffect Development: Landslides make the development and other infrastructural projects risky as well as costly, which, in turn, adversely affects the developmental activities in these areas.\n\nMitigation\n\nThe following are the mitigation measures.\n\nArea-Specific Measures: It is always advisable to adopt area-specific measures to deal with landslides.\n\nRestriction on the Construction in Certain Areas: Restriction on the construction and other developmental activities such as roads and dams, limiting agriculture to valleys and areas with moderate slopes, and control on the development of large settlements in the high vulnerability zones, should be enforced.\n\nHazard Maps: Hazard mapping to locate areas prone to landslides. Hence, such areas can be avoided for building settlements.\n\nAfforestation: Some positive actions like promoting large-scale afforestation programs and the construction of bunds to reduce water flow.\n\nTerrace Farming: Terrace farming should be encouraged in the northeastern hill states where Jhumming (Slash and Burn/Shifting Cultivation) is still prevalent.\n\nLandslide Monitoring and Early Warning System: To warn people residing in landslide-prone areas in advance.\n\nScientific Technique Advancement: Advancement in scientific techniques will empower us to understand what factors cause landslides and how to manage them.\n\nConclusion\n\nLandslide-related disasters are typically much less dramatic than those brought on by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and cyclones, but their effects on the environment and the country\u2019s economy are no less catastrophic.\n\nThey are mostly influenced by extremely localized factors, in contrast to other disasters that are sudden or unpredictable, and are generally controlled by macro or regional factors.\n\nTherefore, gathering information and keeping an eye on the probability of a landslide is not only challenging but also quite expensive. However, certain mitigation methods can undoubtedly aid in lowering the cause and effect related to them.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

The point where the energy is released is called the hypocenter, and the point on the surface directly above it is called the epicentre.\nVolcanic eruptions: Can cause damage through ash flows, mudflows, lava flows, landslides, and the release of gases.\nTsunamis: Can be caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, underwater explosions, and meteorite impacts. For example, the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami was caused by an earthquake, and the 2018 tsunami was caused by the collapse of Anak Krakatoa.\nTropical cyclones: Are often found in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Mexico, and the South China Sea.\n\nOther examples of geophysical phenomena include floods and landslides.\n\nEarthquake\n\nWe often hear about earthquakes in the news. They have a huge potential for destruction wherever they occur. Do you know what causes earthquakes?\n\nAn earthquake is a quick shaking or trembling of the earth\u2019s surface brought on by seismic waves or earthquake waves that are produced as a result of an abrupt movement (an abrupt release of energy) in the earth\u2019s crust (earthquakes with shallow foci) or upper mantle (some shallow-focus and all intermediate and deep-focus earthquakes).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nA seismograph, sometimes known as a seismometer, is a device to identify and document earthquakes.\n\nTo learn more about earthquakes, click here\n\nTsunami\n\n\u2018Tsunami\u2019 is a Japanese word meaning, \u2018harbour wave\u2019. A tsunami is a succession of waves with extremely long wavelengths that occur in vast bodies of water, such as seas or lakes, as a result of a significant disturbance above or below the water\u2019s surface or as a result of the displacement of a significant amount of water.\n\nAlthough the Moon and Sun\u2019s attractions have no bearing on how they arise, they are commonly referred to as tidal waves due to their long wavelengths.\n\nA tsunami can be produced by earthquakes (such as the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004), volcanic eruptions (such as the tsunami brought on by Krakatoa\u2019s violent eruption in 1883), landslides (such as the tsunami brought on by the collapse of a portion of Anak Krakatoa in 2018), underwater explosions, meteorite impacts, etc.\n\nTo know more about tsunamis, click here\n\nVolcanic Activity\n\nA volcano is an opening in the earth\u2019s crust through which gases, molten rock materials (lava), ash, steam etc. are emitted outward in the course of an eruption. Such vents or openings occur in those parts of the earth\u2019s crust where the rock strata are relatively weak. Volcanic activity is an example of endogenic process. Depending upon the explosive nature of the volcano, different landforms can be formed such as a plateau (if the volcano is not explosive) or a mountain (if the volcano is explosive in nature).\n\nTo learn more about volcanoes click here\n\nCyclones\n\nCyclones are the centres of low pressure. They are surrounded by closed isobars having increasing pressure outward.\n\nThe\u00a0wind circulation is from outside towards the central low pressure.\u00a0The inward flow of air is due to the pressure gradient force and the lowest pressure at the centre.\n\nDue to\u00a0Coriolis force, blowing winds are deflected from their paths-\u00a0rightwards in the Northern hemisphere\u00a0and\u00a0leftward in the Southern hemisphere. Thus, they rotate anti-clockwise in the Northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere.\n\nTo learn more about cyclones, click here\n\nAlso Read: Cyclones in the Arabian Sea: Why are they uncommon?\n\nEl Nino and La Nina\n\nYou might have heard about El Nino and La Nina. The El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a major influence on climate patterns in various parts of the world.\n\nIn addition to changes in the atmosphere, this naturally occurring geophysical phenomenon is caused by shifting ocean temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific.\n\nEl Nino\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o means Little Boy or Christ Child in Spanish.\n\nThe extraordinary warming of surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean is referred to as El Nino, a climate pattern.\n\nIt is the \u201cwarm phase\u201d of a larger phenomenon known as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).\n\nIt happens more often than La Nina.\n\nLa Nina\n\nThe unusual cooling of the tropical eastern Pacific is referred to as La Nina, the \u201ccold phase\u201d of ENSO.\n\nContrary to El Nino, which typically lasts little longer than a year, La Nina occurrences may last between one and three years.\n\nEl Nino and La Nina peak during the winter in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nTo learn more about El Nino and La Nina click here\n\nHeatwave\n\nAccording to the IMD, a heatwave is defined as a maximum temperature of at least 40 degrees Celsius for plains, 37 degrees Celsius for coastal regions, and at least 30 degrees Celsius for hilly regions.\n\nTo learn more about heat waves click here\n\nAtlantic Meridional Overturning Circulati0n (AMOC)\n\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a major ocean current system that transports warm surface waters from the tropics toward the northern Atlantic and colder deep waters that are part of the\u00a0thermohaline circulation, southward. One of the main ways the ocean circulates heat, salt, carbon, and nutrients throughout the world\u2019s oceans is through overturning circulation.\n\nTo learn more about AMOC click here\n\nHot Springs\n\nA hot spring, often referred to as a geothermal spring, is an actual water spring that erupts as a result of heated groundwater. Either magma within the Earth\u2019s crust or fault movement within the crust causes heat to be created.\n\nLandslides\n\nThe movement of a mass of rock, rubble, or dirt down a slope is referred to as a landslide. Landslides are a sort of \u201cmass wasting,\u201d which refers to any downward movement of soil or rock caused by gravity alone.\n\nA landslide is a natural occurrence that occurs when soil, rock, or other debris falls as a result of gravity.\n\nIt is brought on by several terrain-specific geo factors (such as slope, lithology, rock structure, land use/cover, geomorphology, etc.), but is typically brought on by torrential rain or earthquake shocks.\n\nRead: Mass wasting\n\nGlacial Lake Outburst Flooding (GLOF)\n\nA glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) occurs when a moraine dam or ice-dam glacial lake fails, releasing meltwater. They result in terrible floods downstream, resulting in significant loss of life and property.\n\nGLOFs have three main characteristics:\n\nThere is an abrupt release of water\nThese are typically brief episodes that last for a few hours to many days.\nThey create significant river outflows downstream.\n\nTo learn more about GLOF click here\n\nCloudbursts\n\nCloudbursts are localised, intense downpour occurrences that last only for a short duration.\nIt is a weather phenomenon where unanticipated precipitation exceeds 100 mm per hour across an area of around 20 to 30 square kilometres.\n\nTo learn more about cloudbursts click here\n\nArticle written by: Caroline",

For eg: the Aravallis of India formed during Precambrian times, denuded and lowered in height over time, now stands as a relic of ancient fold mountains.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCHANGES IN MOUNTAINS AND THEIR REASONS\nGradual denudation and lowering of reliefs due to geomorphic processes such as weathering and erosion by rivers, wind, groundwater, etc\nEndogenetic forces such as volcanism lead to the development of new volcanic mountains or changes in old formations.\nAnthropogenic causes such as urbanization, tourism, agriculture, and other developmental activities affect the morphology of mountains.\nNatural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides bring major structural and morphological changes in mountainous regions.\nEFFECTS OF THESE CHANGES\nPositive\n\t\nNegative\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Weathering and erosion help in soil formation downslope For eg: Great Indian Plains\n\t\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Loss of surface soil from slopes devoid of mountains of fertile soils\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Helps in understanding the formation and development of\u00a0 reliefs and their compositions\n\t\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lack of knowledge of slope management practices renders developmental activities vulnerable to exceeded weathering and erosion as well as natural hazards\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mining helps in the extraction of various mineral resources.\n\t\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides cause damage to human life and property. For eg: the Himalayan region is under Zone 4 and Zone 5 of Earthquake mapping zones in India\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Better planning and management practices. For eg: The watershed development program\n\t\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Threat to water security as mountains provide nearly 70% of freshwater to the planet\n\n\n\t\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Threat to livelihood as mountains provide nearly 20% of global tourism.\nWater bodies\n\nThe following are the various water bodies and the changes associated.\n\nRIVER\n\nAlthough rivers cover only 0.1% of the land, these are considered a critical part of landscapes due to their major role in human life.\n\nThis is corroborated by the fact that major settlements around the world have been around major rivers.\n\nFor example Prayagraj, Agra on banks of Ganga River System; Shanghai- Yangtze River; New york\u2013Hudson River, etc. Therefore, studying changes in the river and its regime becomes important.\n\nCHANGES IN RIVER AND THEIR REASONS\nThe cycle of Erosion- of the river defines its ever-changing nature depicted through different stages i.e, the young stage(small, swift river with vertical corrasion), mature stage(large volume with lateral erosion), and old stage(senile, less volume with only deposition work).\nHeadward erosion leads to the retreat of slopes causing river captures as well as a reduction in relief height.\nClimate change and resultant Changes in Rivers.\nRise in water temperature For ex: According to a recent study by Scientific Report, river water temperatures could rise to 35 degrees Celsius from the present 30 degrees Celsius by 20270-2100, and dissolved oxygen concentrations could drop in Indian rivers.\nDepleting sources of rivers such as glaciers and lack of snow deposition on mountain tops.\nFrequent changes in river courses.\nIncreasing pollution in rivers- Central Pollution Control Board in 2018 found 351 polluted stretches of rivers in India. This is largely due to sewage and industrial waste discharge into the rivers.\nConstruction of Multipurpose projects on rivers for energy as well as drinking and agricultural purposes.\nInterlinking of Rivers to effectively manage water resources by providing excess water from water-rich states to water-deficient states.For ex-: The Ken-Betwa link project\nOther Anthropogenic factors affecting changes in river flows such as illegal sand mining for constructions, overexploitation of fish resources, discharge of untreated sewage and industrial waste, etc.\nEFFECTS OF CHANGES ON RIVER SYSTEMS\n\nThe following are the major changes associated\n\nPositive:\n\nThe cycle of erosion not only maintains the natural ecology of rivers but also:\nDeposit the fertile alluvium on flood plains necessary for agriculture.\nThis leads to the formation of picturesque features such as waterfalls, canyons, gorges,ox-bow lakes, deltas, etc which help the tourism industry to flourish and provide a livelihood to local people\nNatural changes help in maintaining the ecological flow and aquatic life of rivers\nMultipurpose projects have added to the clean, green, and renewable energy capacity of countries.\nInterlinking of rivers is a noble solution for water-stressed areas\n\n\u00a0Negative:\n\nClimate change has impacted rivers in varying degrees right from depleting their sources, rising water temperatures, etc to threatening the natural habitats of native fish and other organisms\nPollution in rivers has only added to the already scarce water resources which have threatened water security. For eg: More than 600 million people in India are suffering from severe water shortages, according to the NITI Aayog\u2019s Composite Water Management Index.\nFrequent changes in river courses lead to floods causing damage to human life and property and it also affects river ecosystems. For example, A significant flood in India in 2008 prompted the Kosi River to switch to an older channel, displacing 3 million people and claiming more than 250 lives.\nMultipurpose projects are not without negative effects such as sedimentation on river beds, dislocation of people, and destruction of flora and fauna, especially aquatic life.\nFluctuations in river flow also affect the Hydrological cycle as these are an essential component that further aggravates the scarcity of freshwater.\nInterlinking of rivers also affects the natural flows of rivers which will affect aquatic ecosystems, ecological flow, etc. of the rivers.\nRising disputes between states over sharing of river water due to water shortages among different regions. For eg: the Cauvery water dispute between Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Puducherry.\nDams and reservoirs over transboundary rivers threaten water security in downstream countries. For eg: India\u2019s concern since 2015 when China operationalized its project at Zangmu on the Brahmaputra river\u00a0\nGroundwater\n\nA part of the rainwater percolates in the rocks and the soils and is available as groundwater.\n\nGroundwater is vital to human welfare and development, and in many countries, it is the principal source of water for drinking, irrigation, and industry.\n\nAs a core component of the hydrological cycle, groundwater is also critical to sustaining many aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nHowever, various issues have emerged regarding its sustainable use and management especially in the present scenario when there are severe water shortages around the world.\n\nCHANGES IN GROUNDWATER\nDepletion of groundwater resources\u2013 Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment Report 2022 states that the total annual groundwater recharge is 437.60 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM) and the annual groundwater extraction is 239.16 BCM.\nAgriculture -accounts for nearly 90% of groundwater withdrawals. Practices such as power subsidies for irrigation, MSP for water-intensive crops such as rice, green revolution, and lack of regulations have expedited its extraction.\nUse for drinking and cooking purposes in water-stressed areas\nDeforestation, urbanization, metalled road construction, etc has led to a decline in the percolation of water underground and hence the recharge of aquifers.\nIndustries, the second-largest users of groundwater i.e approx.5%, likewise rely on groundwater to meet their water requirements.\nVirtual water trade plays a major role in depleting groundwater.\nOverexploitation of existing resources. Out of the country\u2019s total of 7089 assessment units, 1006 units have been labeled as over-exploited.\nPollution with the addition of contaminants such as arsenic, fluoride, iron, and other heavy metals is caused due to human activity, such as residential sewage, agricultural practices, industrial effluents, etc.\nCONSEQUENCES\nThe hydrological cycle is interrupted as groundwater acts as its major component\nWater stress and insecurity are already on the rise and depleting groundwater resources amplify this many folds. The rising population and increased urbanization also increase the demand for domestic water.\nThreat to food security as more than 60% of irrigation in agriculture is met by groundwater in India. This especially has risen after the green revolution.\nIncreased incidents of droughts around the world.\nHealth issues, such as groundwater contamination such as arsenic and fluoride cause cancer and skin problems.\nHealth also impacts Human Capital formation because of high mortality and lifelong diseases among children and adults.\nThe economy of the country is also impacted due to the dependence of many industries on groundwater\nOcean\n\nOceans cover approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contain 97.2%(including ice) of Earth\u2019s water and are divided into five major oceans namely the Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, and Southern Oceans.\n\nIn addition to this oceans represent the largest aquatic ecosystem on planet earth i.e, the Marine ecosystem. Also, oceans contain large reserves of various important resources such as petroleum, fish and other food resources, mineral resources, etc.\n\nOceans and oceanic currents play a major role in maintaining the earth\u2019s climate and wind patterns. Hence these become an important part of the study of changing critical geographical features.\n\nCHANGES IN OCEANS\nNatural changes such as:\nSea Floor Spreading along Mid Oceanic Ridge(Plate Tectonics).\nCreation of new oceans such as the Great African Rift Valley which is in the nascent stage in the process of ocean formation.\n\nThese, however, are prolonged processes that take millions of years to complete.\n\nClimate change results in changes such as:\nOcean acidification\u00a0lowering of ocean pH is a shift in ocean chemistry brought on by the ocean\u2019s uptake of carbon compounds from the atmosphere.\nOcean warming\u2013 According to IPCC since 1970, the world\u2019s oceans have continued to warm, absorbing more than 90% of the extra heat in the climate system.\nSea level rise due to temperature rise( Thermal expansion of oceans), melting of glaciers, etc. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report- Global mean sea level increased by 0.20m between 1901 and 2018.\nPollution: creates the following changes\nEutrophication occurs when the environment becomes\nenriched with nutrients, increasing the amount of plant and algae growth in estuaries and coastal waters.\nPlastic pollution \u2013 Land-based activities such as urban and stormwater runoff, sewer overflows, littering, improper waste management, industrial operations, tire abrasion, building, and illegal dumping are the main sources of plastic debris detected in the ocean.\nCoral Bleaching due to climate change, increased ocean temperature, and eutrophication.\nHuman-induced changes such as increased exploration for oil and mineral resources, ocean thermal energy extraction, fishing, transportation of goods, etc impact oceans and their ecosystem. For eg: oil spills create dead zones in oceans.\nIMPACTS OF SUCH CHANGES\nNatural changes help us understand the evolution of the earth and its crust such as the presence of a relatively new oceanic crust near Mid Oceanic Ridge which becomes older away from it as well as the oceanic crust being relatively new concerning continental crust.\nOceans absorb extra heat from the atmosphere therefore these changes help regulate the Earth\u2019s climate\nEnergy security by harnessing ocean wave energy.\nFood and nutritional security through fishing, whaling, ocean ranching, etc., and alternate livelihood opportunities for the poor.\n\nNevertheless, the above benefits are availed at a much larger cost:\n\nClimate change \u2013 has led to the following harmful impacts on oceans:-\nChanges in oceanic current patterns and the reduction difference between cold and warm currents have impacted the earth\u2019s heat budget, fish production, the livelihood of fishers, etc\nChange in wind and weather patterns for ex: the frequency of El NINO \u2013 Southern Oscillations has increased.\nSea level rise has become a major problem for Small Island Nations as they face submergence danger. This also impacts coastal erosion, coastal livelihood, etc.\nThe increased temperature of oceans has also impacted their biodiversity due to the increased demand for oxygen.\nPollution in oceans has threatened marine species as well as humans on a larger scale.\nFor example, Eutrophication contaminates water, negatively affects seashore recreational opportunities, creates a dead water zone or hypoxia, and depleted oxygen levels impair or could kill fish in large numbers and change species composition.\nPlastic, mainly in the form of microplastic, enters the food web through bioaccumulation and biomagnification.\nOther pollutants such as disposal of harmful chemicals, industrial waste, Agri nutrients, etc also deteriorate ocean ecosystems.\nCoral bleaching also is dangerous for many reasons. Corals are an indicator of a healthy marine ecosystem and play a major role in its food chain, their destruction can impact coastal protection and biodiversity. Their destruction also impacts tourism and therefore the livelihood of people.\nOverexploitation of fish resources through unscientific practices such as trawling has impacted ocean diversity.\nExtraction of petroleum, polymetallic nodules, other metallic and non-metallic minerals, and oil spills also disrupt marine life.\nGlaciers and Ice-Caps\n\nCurrently, glaciers and ice caps cover around 10% of the earth\u2019s land surface, especially in regions like Greenland and Antarctica. Glaciers can be found in mountain ranges also, although, on Earth, 99% of the glacial ice is stored within enormous ice sheets in the polar regions.\n\nThe amount, variability, and water quality of runoff in their immediate vicinity are all impacted by glaciers, which are significant components of Earth\u2019s water cycle.\n\nThese also provide some of the most spectacular landforms such as Moraines, fiords, cirques, icebergs, etc. on the surface of Earth.\n\nHowever, with the advent of human-induced climate change, these experience various changes some of which are irreversible.\n\nCHANGES EXPERIENCED BY GLACIERS AND ICE CAPS\n\nThe following changes are associated with icecaps\n\nClimate change\n\nClimate change is the leading cause of changes in the mass of ice cover over the earth\u2019s surface. This process of climate change affecting ice cover is natural as is evident from the geological time scale.\n\nThere have been numerous warm periods\u2014as when the dinosaurs were alive\u2014and many cold ones, like the most recent ice age, which lasted for around 20,000 years. A large portion of the northern hemisphere was covered in ice and glaciers during the last ice age.\n\nHowever, at present, this change is more prominent due to anthropogenic activities such as agriculture, industrialization, carbon emissions, deforestation, vehicular emissions, etc causing global warming.\n\nGreenland ice sheet- lost ice mass at an average rate of 278 billion tonnes every year between 2006 and 2015(IPCC report). Also, another phenomenon is called zombie ice, which does not accumulate fresh snow even while continuing to be part of the parent ice sheet.\nAntarctica\u2019s Melting Ice \u2013 for ex: Doomsday Glacier also known as The Thwaites Glacier is 120 km wide at its widest point, moving quickly, and melting rapidly over time.\nThawing of Permafrost regions \u2013 Permafrost is a permanently frozen layer on or under Earth\u2019s surface. It consists of soil, gravel, and sand, usually bound together by ice. Permafrost usually remains at or below 0\u00b0C (32\u00baF) for at least two years. Permafrost can be found on land and below the ocean floor. According to a recent study, an additional 1.5 million square miles of permafrost may eventually disappear for every 1.8\u00b0F (1\u00b0C) of warming.\nChanges in glacial landforms such as an increased number of glacial lakes, moraines, glacial till, etc.\nIMPACT OF MELTING GLACIER AND ICE CAPS\nSea Level Rise\u2013 for ex: Thwaites glaciers\u2019 melting already contributes 4% annually to the rise in sea level causing storm surges and coastal erosion, coastal storms like hurricanes and typhoons brought on by warming air and ocean temperatures.\nChange in Weather patterns \u2013 Because of modifications to the jet stream brought on by a combination of warming air and ocean temperatures in the Arctic and the tropics, the polar vortex is surfacing outside of the Arctic more regularly. This is due to the change in circulations in oceans brought about by melting Antarctic and Greenland Ice.\nLoss of wildlife habitats as glacier mountains are home to critical species such as snow leopards, polar bears, etc.\nDepleting sources of freshwater as many major glaciers feed the headstreams of major rivers. In the Himalayan, for example, the Ganga River, Yamuna River, and Indus River are all fed by glaciers such as Gangotri and Yamunotri.\nIncreased incidents of floods and Glacial Outbursts due to increasing water influx lead to loss of life and property.\nLoss of livelihood especially in coastal areas due to coastal erosion, submergence, increased storm surges due to sea level rise\nImpacts of Permafrost Thawing \u2013\nIncreasing incidents of Viruses and Bacteria- The potential danger was highlighted by a 2016 anthrax epidemic in Siberia that was connected to a decades-old reindeer carcass revealed by melted permafrost.\nThawing of frozen soil \u2013 recommences the decomposition process of dead organic matter that was earlier paused due to the freezing of dead plants and animals which results in the emission of greenhouse gases.\nFlora and Fauna\n\nThe term \u201cflora\u201d refers to all plant life that is present in a certain area or time, usually only the native, naturally occurring plants. Whereas, all of the animal life that is present in a certain area or time is known as fauna.\n\nBecause they make up the delicate web of life, where each organism has something to offer, even if only in a very small way, the flora and fauna are essential.\n\nThe earth\u2019s plants create the oxygen that the fauna breathes, and the fauna then exhales the carbon dioxide that the flora needs to survive. Humans are unable to survive without either of these substances.\n\nTherefore it is important to understand any changes in flora and fauna for us to implement better planning and management practices concerning sustainable development.\n\nChanges in Flora\n\nThe following are the various changes associated\n\nGrasslands\nGrasslands make up 40% of the land area. These typically exist between mountainous and desert climates. Only 10% of the world\u2019s grasslands are protected, though.\nOnly 1% of the original tallgrass prairie remains today, while over 50% of all temperate grasslands and 16% of tropical grasslands have been converted to agriculture or industrial purposes.\nConversion of grasslands for economic activities such as ranching, Dairy Farms, Sheep rearing for wool, etc in North and South America, New Zealand, Australia, etc.\nDegradation of grasslands due to unscientific agricultural practices such as monocropping, chemical fertilizers, and overgrazing.\nThe advent of invasive species has impacted local vegetation.\nTherefore, the fauna inhabiting these grasslands is also in decline such as African Cheetah being vulnerable under IUCN.\nClimate Change has also impacted grasslands as their relatively flat geography makes them more vulnerable to the effects of climate change and animals must travel great distances to adapt to temperature changes.\nCONSEQUENCES\nBiodiversity loss due to the extinction of plant and animal species.\nLand degradation and desertification.\nFood insecurity will further as these sustain major agricultural activities.\nImpact on cultural and recreational activities such as Savanna Safari where people interact with nature and wild animals.\nThreat to the livelihood of tribal people who are dependent on grassland and its fauna for survival.\nForest\n\nAccording to the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 (FRA 2020), representing almost 31% of the world\u2019s surface area, forests were reported to encompass 4.06 billion hectares in 2020.\n\nForests offer more than just habitat for animals and means of subsistence for people. They also protect watersheds, stop soil erosion, and lessen the effects of climate change.\n\nGiven these advantages, the forest area around the world is still in decline.\n\nCHANGES IN FORESTS\nLoss of Forests due to deforestation which in turn is caused by various activities such as agriculture, urbanization, mineral exploration, etc. According to the State of the World\u2019s Forests 2022\u00a0 420 million hectares of forests have been lost between 1990 and 2020 from deforestation.\nForest Degradation due to illegal logging.\nDeclining floral and faunal biodiversity of forests due to human encroachments, climate change, etc.\nConversion of forests into conservation reserves and protected areas to protect local flora and fauna.\nInvasive species of trees are on the rise.\nIncreased incidence of Forest fires. For eg: Wildfires in the Amazon forests in Brazil and in Australia in the last two years, were caused by both climate change and human activities.\nWestern Maharashtra, Southern Chhattisgarh, regions of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, together with central Odisha, are \u201cextremely prone\u201d forest fire hotspots, according to the MoEFCC 2020\u20132021 annual report.\nEFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FORESTS\nIncreased Greenhouse Gas Emissions as 15% of greenhouse gas emissions are due to deforestation and forest degradation.\nRise in temperatures, changes in patterns of weather and water, and an increased frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change caused by such emissions.\nSoil Erosion increases due to shifting cultivation, removal of forests for agriculture, etc.\nDisruption of the Hydrological cycle because by assisting in maintaining equilibrium between water on the ground and water in the atmosphere, trees play a significant part in the local water cycle. However, this equilibrium can be upset by deforestation or environmental degradation, changing precipitation, and river flow.\nDestruction and Loss of biodiversity due to wildfires.\nDisruption of Livelihoods- Around the world, 1.25 billion people depend on forests for their homes, means of subsistence, and access to water, fuel, and food. And 750 million people live in the woods, which is almost one-fifth of all rural residents.\nLoss of culturally significant sacred groves.\nIncrease in Infectious Diseases: Forests are related to 15% of 250 Emerging Infectious Diseases.\nMangrove\n\nMangrove forests are fertile wetlands that grow in coastal intertidal zones. They are also known as mangrove swamps, mangrove thickets, or mangals. Due to mangroves\u2019 inability to survive subfreezing temperatures, mangrove forests are primarily found in tropical and subtropical latitudes.\n\nAround 80 different species of mangroves have been identified as existing on maritime beaches throughout the world. Based on remote sensing and worldwide data for 2010, the Global Mangrove Watch Initiative published a global baseline in 2018.\n\nAccording to this, there are mangrove forests in 118 different countries and territories with a total area of 137,600 km2 (53,100 sq mi) as of 2010.\n\nCHANGES IN MANGROVE FORESTS\u00a0\nIn the face of infrastructural development, urbanization, and agricultural land conversion, mangroves are disappearing at a rate that is three to five times faster than the overall loss of world forest cover, according to UNESCO.\nA fifth of the degradation of mangrove ecosystems is due to shrimp cultivation.\nClimate Change \u2013 Greater sea level increases have been linked to the breakdown of the mangrove ecosystem, according to recent studies.\nIllegal logging, invasive species, and a decline in biodiversity have also altered mangrove distribution.\nIMPACTS OF CHANGES IN MANGROVES\u00a0\nEcological Destabilization as mangroves serves as a reservoir in the tertiary absorption of waste, helping to construct and preserve the soil.\nLoss of Biodiversity with loss of mangroves as diverse varieties of fauna, including birds, fish, insects, mammals, and plants, find habitat and safety here.\nMangrove forests protect the shoreline from erosion caused by storm surges, currents, waves, and tides. Hence, these also protect human life and property in coastal areas. For example, during the 2004 Tsunami coastal communities in Tamil Nadu suffered minimal damage.\nPositive Feedback to Climate Change \u2013 because these represent 10\u201315% of carbon burial.\nLoss of LIvelihood to many coastal communities dependent upon mangroves for their fuel and fodder.\nCHANGES IN FAUNA\u00a0\nAccording to scientific research, Earth\u2019s wildlife populations have decreased by an average of 69% in just under 50 years.\nThe average size of the wildlife population has seen the steepest decline which is 94% in 48 years in Latin America and the Caribbean, including the Amazon.\nThe sixth mass extinction, which is the biggest loss of life on Earth since the extinction of the dinosaurs, is widely believed to be occurring right now, and many scientists feel that humans are to blame.\nFreshwater populations have decreased the most, according to the WWF, with an average reduction of 83% between 1970 and 2018. According to the IUCN Red List, amphibians are the species that are most in danger, followed by corals and an ancient group of seed plants called cycads.\nExtinction of species \u2013 most recently such Pinta Giant Tortoise, Yangtze River Dolphin, Western Black Rhinoceros, and Ivory Billed Woodpecker with more than 42,100 species facing extinction.\nHabitats of many species such as Asiatic lions, African Cheetahs, tigers, etc. have come to only a few restricted places. For example, Asiatic Lions are only found in Gir National Park.\nIncreasing the number of conservation areas around the world to protect the loss of biodiversity.\n\nReasons for changes in Fauna\n\nNatural causes: Floods, landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions other natural disasters also cause loss of biodiversity.\nHabitat loss and fragmentation \u2013 are the main factors causing the extinction of animals and plants. Natural forests are cut down to provide room for businesses, farms, dams, homes, recreational activities, etc. Tropical rainforests are the most shocking examples of habitat loss.\nLand use change is still the biggest current threat to nature, destroying or fragmenting the natural habitats of many plant and animal species on land, in freshwater, and the sea.\nOverexploitation by humans over the past 500 years has led to the extinction of numerous species (Steller\u2019s sea cow, passenger pigeon), etc.\nClimate Change \u2013 Animals have reacted differently to climate change than humans. Climate change causes species to migrate, adapt, or, if neither of those things happens, to go extinct.\nIntroduction of alien invasive species \u2013 The native catfish in Indian rivers are in danger due to the recent illegal introduction of the African catfish for aquaculture reasons.\nIllegal Poaching and Hunting are the main cause of extinction of many animal and fish species, for ex: Asian cheetah while others are on the brink of extinction such as the one-horned rhino, Tiger, Elephants\nIllegal trade in wildlife for their use in medicines and decorative purposes eg Mongoose hair, rhino horn, snake skins, tiger and leopard claws, etc\n\nEffects of Changes in Fauna\n\nDisruption in Ecosystems \u2013 If a species has a unique function in its ecosystem, it\u2019s the extinction of other species and the ecosystem itself.\nMultiple Effects of Losing Apex Predators \u2013 Scientists claim that the loss of these species has contributed to pandemics, fires, the invasive spread of species, the deterioration of ecosystem services, and a drop in carbon sequestration.\nPollination is negatively impacted as approximately all blooming plants in the tropical rainforest are pollinated by animals, as are 75% of the world\u2019s food crops, which are either entirely or partially pollinated by insects and other animals.\nLosing the healing benefits of nature \u2013 More than 25% of prescription drugs include compounds that were found in plants or animals. The source of penicillin was a fungus.\nIncreased Human-Wildlife conflict due to habitat loss and deforestation. For ex: In reserves, 125 people were killed by tigers between 2019 and 2021. With 6 deaths, Maharashtra accounted for almost half of these.\nThis also leads to other Impacts such as damage to crops, increased cruelty towards animals, the economic burden on farmers, etc.\nDestruction of livelihood \u2013 According to a study for the U.N., the continued loss of species could cost the world 18 percent of global economic output by 2050.\n\nArticle Written By: Ankit Sharma",

Thus, through the processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation, and precipitation, there is a constant exchange of water between the atmosphere, the seas, and the continents.\nWith height, the amount of water vapour drops. It likewise gets smaller as you get closer to the poles from the equator (or from low latitudes) (or towards the high latitudes).\nIts maximum amount of water in the atmosphere could be up to 4% which is found in the warm and wet regions.\nWater in the atmosphere (vapour) retains the heat that the planet radiates by absorbing some of the incoming solar radiation (insolation) from the sun. As a result, it works as a blanket, keeping the ground from getting too hot or too cold.\nWater vapour also contributes to stability and instability in the air.\n\nTo know about atmospheric circulation, click here.\n\n\u00a0Humidity\n\nWater vapour present in the air is known as Humidity.\n\nAbsolute humidity\nRelative humidity\nABSOLUTE HUMIDITY\nAbsolute humidity is the measure of the actual water vapour content of the air.\nIt is measured in terms of grams per cubic meter and represents the weight of water vapour per volume of air.\nThe absolute humidity\u00a0differs\u00a0from place to place on the surface of the earth.\nThe temperature of the air determines simply whether or not it can hold water vapour (Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air).\nRELATIVE HUMIDITY\nThe relative humidity is the ratio of the amount of moisture in the air to its maximum capacity at a particular temperature.\nThe ability to hold moisture increases or decreases as the air temperature changes and the relative humidity is also impacted.\nOver oceans, the relative humidity is higher, whereas, over continents, it is lower (absolute humidity is greater over oceans because of the greater availability of water for evaporation).\nThe amount and rate of evaporation are determined by the relative humidity, making it a crucial climatic component.\nDEW POINT\nAt a specific temperature, the air is considered to be saturated when it is fully saturated with moisture.\nIt signifies that at that point, the air at the specified temperature is unable to hold any more moisture.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which a given sample of air becomes saturated.\nDew point occurs when Relative Humidity is 100%\nEvaporation And Condensation\n\nWater in the atmosphere consists of evaporation and condensation forms.\n\nEVAPORATION\nWater changes from a liquid to a gas through the process of evaporation.\nEvaporation is mostly caused by heat. The latent heat of vapourization is the term used to describe the temperature at which water begins to evaporate.\nThe given parcel of air can absorb and hold more water when the temperature rises. Similar to this, low moisture content air has the potential to absorb and hold moisture. The saturated layer is replaced by the unsaturated layer as a result of air movement. Therefore, evaporation increases in direct proportion to air movement.\nCONDENSATION\nIt is the process by which water vapour turns into actual water.\nCondensation is caused by the loss of heat.\nThe degree of cooling and the relative humidity of the air affect condensation.\nThe amount of air present, the temperature, the pressure, and the humidity all affect condensation.\nBoth when the dew point is lower than the freezing point and when it is greater than the freezing point, condensation occurs.\nIt takes place:\n\nwhen the temperature of the air is dropped to dew point while maintaining its volume constant (adiabatically);\n\nwhen both the volume and the temperature are reduced;\n\nAnd when moisture is added to the air through evaporation.\n\nAfter condensation, the water vapour or the moisture in the atmosphere takes one of the following forms \u2014 dew, frost, fog, and clouds.\u00a0\n\nDEW\nDew is formed when moisture is deposited as water droplets on cooler surfaces of solid objects (rather than nuclei in the air on the surface) such as stones, grass blades, and plant leaves.\nThe ideal conditions for its formation are\u00a0a clear sky, calm air, high relative humidity, and\u00a0cold and long nights.\nFor the formation of dew, it is necessary that the\u00a0dew point is above the freezing point.\u00a0\nFROST\nFrost forms on cold surfaces when condensation takes place\u00a0below the freezing point (0\u00b0 C), i.e. the\u00a0dew point\u00a0is at or below the freezing point.\nInstead of water droplets, the extra moisture is deposited as minute ice crystals.\nThe optimum conditions for the creation of white frost are the same as those for the formation of dew, with the exception that the air temperature must be at or below freezing.\nFOG\nWhen the temperature of an air mass containing a substantial amount of water vapour suddenly drops, condensation occurs on small dust particles inside the air mass.\nSo, the fog is a\u00a0cloud with its base at or very near the ground. Because of the fog and mist, the visibility becomes poor to zero.\n\nRadiation smog\u00a0often arises at night when surface heat is reflected into space. As the earth\u2019s surface cools, the air becomes completely humid, transforming into a fog.\n\nAdvection fog\u00a0is similar to radiation fog in appearance, but it is generated when warm moist air travels horizontally over a cold surface, generating condensation. Sea fog is a typical kind of advection smog.\n\nIce fog\u00a0is formed from ice crystals. Ice fog forms when the air temperature is below freezing.\u00a0\n\nFreezing fog\u00a0is made up of supercooled water droplets that turn from liquid to ice when they come into touch with a cold surface. Objects exposed to freezing fog frequently develop ice covering.\n\nFog is generally associated with hazardous driving conditions. Because drivers cannot see very far in front of them (oftentimes, their depth perception becomes skewed), foggy weather can cause many dangerous accidents.\n\nSmoke generates a large number of nuclei that aid in the development of fog and mist in urban and industrial areas. Smog is a phenomenon that occurs when fog and smoke mingle.\n\u00a0COMPARISON BETWEEN FOG AND SMOG\nFog\n\t\nSmog\n\n\n\u00a0Water droplets condensed around a dust particle.\n\t\nWater droplets condensed around a particle of pollutant like SO2.\n\n\n\u00a0It reduces visibility and damages the crops.\n\t\nReduces visibility.\n\n\n\t\nCauses health issues.\n\u00a0Clouds\nA cloud is a mass of minute water droplets or microscopic ice crystals generated by the condensation of water vapour in free air at high altitudes.\nAs the clouds are formed at some height over the surface of the earth, they take various shapes.\nAccording to their height, expanse, density, and transparency or opaqueness, clouds are grouped under four types :\nCIRRUS\nCirrus clouds are formed at high altitudes (8,000 \u2013 12,000m)\nThey are thin and detached clouds having a\u00a0feathery appearance.\u00a0\nThey are always white.\n\u00a0 CUMULUS\nCumulus clouds look like\u00a0cotton wool.\nThese are generally formed at a height of 4,000 \u2013 7,000 m.\nThey exist in patches and can be seen scattered here and there.\nThese clouds have a flat base.\n\u00a0\u00a0 STRATUS\u00a0\nThese are layered clouds covering large portions of the sky.\nThese clouds are generally formed either due to loss of heat or the mixing of air masses with different temperatures.\nNIMBUS\nNimbus clouds are black or dark grey.\nThey form at middle levels or very near to the surface of the earth.\nThese are extremely dense and opaque to the rays of the sun.\nNimbus clouds are shapeless masses of thick vapour.\n\nA combination of these four basic types can give rise to the following types of clouds:\n\nHigh clouds \u2013 cirrus, cirrostratus, cirrocumulus;\u00a0\nMiddle clouds \u2013 altostratus and altocumulus;\u00a0\nLow clouds \u2013 stratocumulus and nimbostratus (long duration rainfall cloud) and\u00a0\nClouds with extensive vertical development \u2013 cumulus and cumulonimbus (thunderstorm cloud)\u00a0\nPrecipitation\n\nAfter condensation, the release of moisture is known as precipitation.\n\nIt can occur in the following forms:\n\nRain:\u00a0Precipitation in the form of water is called rain.\n\nDrizzle:\u00a0It sprays like rainfall which is very slow with water droplets having 0.5mm diameter. They mostly happen via stratus clouds.\n\nSnow:\u00a0When the temperature falls below 0\u00b0 C, precipitation falls in the form of thin flakes of snow and is referred to as snowfall. Hexagonal crystals are formed as a result of the discharge of moisture. These crystals combine to make snowflakes.\n\nSleet:\u00a0It\u2019s made of frozen raindrops and refrozen melted snow. Sleet forms when a layer of air with a temperature above freezing overlies a layer of air with a temperature below freezing near the ground.\n\nTypes Of Rainfall\n\nBased on origin, rainfall may be classified into three main types \u2013\u00a0convectional, orographic or relief,\u00a0and\u00a0cyclonic or frontal.\u00a0\n\nConvectional Rainfall\nConvectional rainfall happens when the sun\u2019s energy heats the Earth\u2019s surface, forcing water to evaporate and produce water vapour.\nWhen the land warms, the air above it warms as well. As a result, the air expands and rises. The rising air cools and condenses. This condensation mechanism creates clouds high in the atmosphere.\nThis type of rainfall is very common in tropical areas.\nBecause convective clouds are more vertical than horizontal, their strength changes rapidly and across a smaller area.\nIn the tropics, convective rainfall results in hail storms whereas in mid-latitudes it results in cold fronts, squalls, and warm fronts.\nOrographic Rainfall\nWhen warm wet air is blocked by a mountain, it climbs to a high altitude along the mountain slope.\nIt condenses at high altitudes, resulting in severe rains. This is referred to as orographic rainfall.\nCyclonic Rain\nCyclonic Rainfall is\u00a0convectional rainfall on a large scale.\nPrecipitation in a tropical cyclone is convectional, whereas precipitation in a temperate cyclone is due to frontal activity.\nWorld Distribution of Rainfall\nDifferent places on the earth\u2019s surface receive different amounts of rainfall in a year.\nRainfall steadily decreases as we move from the equator to the pole.\nThe equatorial zone and the monsoon region of Southeast Asia have the most rainfall. Precipitation is modest in the middle latitudes, but it is scarce in the desert regions of the subtropics and around the poles.\nRain is greater on the eastern shores between latitudes 35\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 N and S of the equator and gradually decreases towards the west. However, due to the westerlies, rainfall is first obtained on the western borders of the continents and then decreases towards the east between 45\u00b0 and 65\u00b0 N and S of the equator.\nMajor precipitation regimes of the world are characterized based on total yearly precipitation as follows: o The trade winds from both hemispheres converge in the equatorial belt, causing a general upward motion of air that becomes intensified locally in tropical storms that produce very heavy rains in the Caribbean, the Indian and southwest Pacific oceans, and the China Sea, as well as thunderstorms that are particularly frequent and active over land areas.\nRainfall in the interior continental areas is moderate, ranging from 100 to 200 cm per year. The continents\u2019 coastal parts receive a moderate quantity of rainfall.\nRainfall in the central tropical area and the eastern and inner temperate lands ranges between 50 and 100 cm per year.\nLow precipitation at high latitudes, particularly in the polar regions, is caused partly by the subsidence of air in high-pressure belts and partly by cold temperatures. Snow and rainfall from time to time, but evaporation from the freezing sea and land surfaces is slow, and the frigid air has limited moisture capacity.\n\nTo learn more about the Composition and Structure of the Earth\u2019s Atmosphere click here\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

Also dyewoods.\nLianas, epiphytic and parasitic plants are also found.\nIn such vegetation, trees of a single species are rare.\nSavanna or Sudan Climate (or Tropical Wet and Dry Climate)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBetween equatorial woods and trade wind-heated deserts, the savanna or Sudan climate can be found.\nIt is restricted to the tropics (Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn) and is most developed in Sudan, where dry and wet climates are most distinct, therefore the name Sudan climate.\nIt covers much of Africa (Keya, Nigeria, Gambia) as well as large areas of Australia, South America (Brazilian highlands), and India.\nThe Savana Climate features a distinct dry season in the winter compared to other world climates. The region\u2019s rainfall is concentrated throughout the summer. Much vegetation dies during the lengthy dry season, and waterways dry up, causing animals to migrate.\nDISTRIBUTION\nIt is located on either side of the equator in tropical latitudes. It is well developed in Sudan, where there are distinct rainy and dry seasons, hence the name.\nAfrica (African Sudan, East Africa) and South America have this climate in the northern hemisphere (Llanos grasslands of Orinoco river basin).\nThis climate is prevalent in Australia, South America (Campos grasslands of the Brazilian Highlands), and the southern hemisphere (in Northern Australia \u2013 south of its monsoon strip).\n\nAlso read: International Climate Action in Civil Aviation\n\nTEMPERATURE\nFor lowlands, monthly temperatures in this area might vary from 20 to 32 degrees Celsius, but the range widens as one gets farther from the equator.\nThe annual average temperature is around 18 degrees centigrade\nThe greatest temperature is in April in the northern hemisphere and October in the southern hemisphere, right before the start of the rainy season. The summer solstice falls in the northern hemisphere in June, but it is not the hottest month.\nA cloudy sky causes temperatures to fall during the rainy season. Midday temperatures frequently exceed 37 degrees Celsius in the summer.\nTemperatures dip below 10 degrees centigrade even in the hot season due to rapid radiation loss at night caused by clear skies. A frequent occurrence during this season is night frost.\nThus, a typical characteristic feature of the Savanna climate is the extreme diurnal range of temperature.\nPRECIPITATION\nThe region is characterized by a hot, rainy season and a cool, dry season.\nThe hot and humid season lasts from May until September in the northern hemisphere (e.g., Kano, in Nigeria). The remainder of the year is chilly and dry. Over 80 centimetres of rain occur annually in Kano, which is more than 1500 metres above mean sea level, with the majority of it falling during the summer.\nIn the southern hemisphere, the rainy season begins in October and ends in March.\nAs one proceeds away from the equator and towards the desert borders, the length of the rainy season and total annual rainfall both decrease significantly.\nWINDS\nThe prevailing winds of the region that deliver rainfall to the coastal areas are known as trade winds. Easterly breezes blow from east to west, so rainfall is most on the east coasts.\nIn the summer, when the ITCZ is located over a scorching desert, they are at their strongest. They move over the coastal regions, expelling all the moisture, and by the time they get to the interiors of the continent, they are comparatively dry.\nThe easterly trade winds in West Africa blow offshore, bringing dry, dusty winds from the Sahara to the coast of Guinea. This hot, dry, dusty breeze is referred to locally as \u201cthe doctor\u201d or \u201cHarmattan.\u201d\nAlthough Harmattan has a terrible impact on the crops, it also has a cooling effect. By speeding up evaporation, it offers some relief from Guinea\u2019s humid air.\nTrade winds are to blame for the region\u2019s distinct, alternating dry and wet seasons. Rainfall is brought on by onshore trade winds during the summer. Off-shore winds keep the weather dry during the winter.\nVEGETATION\nTall grass and little trees make up much of the local vegetation. \u2018Parkland\u2019 or \u2018bush-veld\u2019 are other terms for grassland.\nAlong with the river banks, tree cover is maximum towards the equator and declines in density and height further from it.\nThe trees are deciduous, which means they lose their leaves in the cool, dry months to reduce transpiration losses. Acacia is a classic representative of this kind.\nOther tree varieties include those with wide trunks that function as water reservoirs to assist them to endure dry spells or droughts. For instance, bottle trees, baobabs, etc.\nThey are hardwood trees, sometimes thorny, which exude gum like the \u2018gum Arabic.\nThis region\u2019s grass is unusually tall and coarse, reaching heights of 6-12 feet. Elephant grass, the highest type of grass, may reach heights of 15 feet.\nThe grass is dense, with lengthy roots that stretch down for water. The grass appears dormant throughout the dry season and blooms during the rainy season.\nAs one approaches the desert, the grasses give way to prickly shrubs.\nWILDLIFE\nThe savanna is home to some of the world\u2019s largest terrestrial species.\nThe two main groups of animals include \u2013 herbivores and carnivores.\nZebra, giraffe, elephant, antelope, and other savanna herbivores are well-known. Herbivores are either blessed with exceptional speed to flee or have camouflage abilities to avoid carnivores.\nThis region\u2019s carnivores include lions, hyenas, leopards, panthers, pumas, and jaguars, among others. For attacking other animals, they have powerful jaws and teeth.\nAside from rhinos and hippos, reptiles such as crocodiles, monitor lizards, and giant lizards can be found in rivers and marshy areas.\nWorld Climate: Tropical Monsoon Climate\n\nThe area between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn is home to the monsoon climate, commonly referred to as the tropical monsoon climate.\nThe inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), which moves through the area, influences its world climate, which is hot and muggy throughout the year.\nMonsoons are seasonal breezes that blow over land from the oceans and vice versa.\nThey are distinguished by a seasonal reversal in wind direction, which causes temperature and precipitation changes.\nSummer, winter, and rainy seasons are the three prominent and distinct seasons of this climatic region.\nDISTRIBUTION\nThey are confined within 5 \u2013 30 degrees latitudes on either side of the equator.\nThailand, India, and Indo-China (Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia). This world climate can be found in southern China and northern Australia.\nWINDS\nSeasonal wind reversal is caused by the differential pace of heating and cooling of continental landmasses and seawaters.\nDuring the summer, as the sun passes overhead the Tropic of Cancer, a low-pressure zone forms over Central Asia. As a result, the Asian continent warms quicker than the surrounding oceans, which remain at a higher pressure in the northern hemisphere.\nIn the southern hemisphere, winter conditions prevail, leading to a high-pressure zone over northern Australia.\nWinds blow out from the Australian landmass towards Java (Indonesia) and are drawn to the low-pressure region over the Indian subcontinent after crossing the equator due to the Coriolis force. These are the South-West monsoon winds.\nDuring winters, a reversal in the wind direction occurs.\nTEMPERATURE\nSummers are warm to hot due to the region\u2019s proximity to the tropics.\nThe average monthly temperature is over 18 degrees Celsius, however, in the summer, the maximum temperature can reach 45 degrees Celsius.\nThe average temperature in the summer is around 30 degrees centigrade, with an overall temperature range of 30 to 45 degrees centigrade.\nWinter temperatures range from 15 to 30 degrees Celsius. In the winter, the average temperature is around 25 degrees Celsius.\nPRECIPITATION\nThe region receives a lot of rain in a short period of time.\nThe annual average rainfall is roughly 200-250 cm. However, some areas have a very high average of around 350 cm.\nMaysynram and Cherrapunji in the Khasi Hills (Meghalaya) receive over 1000cm of rain per year. They are positioned on the hills\u2019 windward side, resulting in significant orographic rains (caused by a lift of the monsoon winds). These areas receive a lot of rain because of their placement between mountains, which generates a concentration of rain-bearing clouds, also known as the funnelling effect.\nSEASONS\n\nUnlike the tropical world climate, which has no distinct seasons, the monsoon climate has significant seasonal changes in meteorological conditions.\n\nTHE HOT DRY SEASON\nThis lasts from March to mid \u2013 June.\nThe sun is in a northward shift to the Tropic of Cancer. This causes the temperatures to rise sharply.\nIn Central India, average daytime temperatures exceed 35 degrees Celsius. Temperatures in Sindh and south India can reach 44 degrees Celsius.\nTemperatures are lower at the seaside due to the influence of sea breezes.\nExcept for the occasional thunderstorms, there is little rainfall during this season.\nTHE RAINY SEASON\nThis lasts from mid \u2013 June to September\nThe rains begin with a monsoon \u2018burst\u2019 over the subcontinent. It causes torrential rains over the country.\nDuring this season, the country receives more than 70% of its annual rainfall.\nThis is a typical aspect of the monsoon type of climate, with concentrated heavy rainfall throughout the summer months.\nTHE COLD DRY SEASON\nThis season begins in October and lasts until February.\nAlso known as the receding monsoon season. The southwest monsoon begins to withdraw southwards when the sun begins its southward journey, eventually leaving the Indian landmass entirely.\nAs the land mass\u2019s temperatures start to drop, the Indian subcontinent experiences a higher pressure than the nearby seas. This makes the winds blow away from the continent and toward the sea.\nIn the months of November and December, winds from the northeast start to blow over the Bay of Bengal, bringing some rain to India\u2019s southeast coastline area.\nThe Western Disturbances bring some rain and snow to the north, but overall the area is dry. Winter crops require frontal (cyclonic) rains brought on by the western disturbances in order to survive.\nMONSOON FORESTS\nAlso known as the Tropical Monsoon Forests.\nThe majority of these are deciduous trees, which have a specific season for leaf loss. To reduce transpiration losses during the dry/drought season, they shed their leaves.\nThey are classified as moist deciduous when the annual rainfall exceeds 150cm and dry deciduous when the annual rainfall is less than 150cm.\nSimilar to equatorial rainforests, they consist of broad-leaf hardwood trees. However, the forests are less dense, more open, and have a smaller variety of species (flora as well as fauna).\nEvergreen rainforests of the tropical kind can be found anywhere there is a rainfall of more than 200\u2013250 cm. These are prevalent in India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar islands, forests in the northeast, and the southern Western Ghats. Southeast Asian islands also include them.\nSavanna-like grasslands with sporadic trees are present anywhere there is little rainfall.\nAs a result, monsoon vegetation ranges from thick forests to thorny scrublands (savanna).\nWorld Climate: Desert Climate\n\nDesert regions are distinguished by little rainfall and sparse vegetation. The growing season is restricted to a brief rainy season.\nDue to a lack of moisture and food, the region\u2019s landscape is devoid of plants and animals.\nThey can be of two types:\n\nhot deserts\u2013 like the Saharan desert\n\nmid-latitude deserts\u2013 like the Gobi desert.\n\nHOT DESERTS \u2013 DISTRIBUTION\nThe world\u2019s most important hot deserts are located on the western margins of continents between latitudes 15 to 30 degrees north and south.\nThe Sahara desert, which has an extent of 3.5 million square miles, is the largest of the hot deserts. The Great Australian Desert, Arabian Desert, Kalahari Desert, Thar Desert, and others are notable examples of hot deserts.\nAmerica also contains hot deserts. They are referred to in North America as the Mohave, Sonoran, Californian, and Mexican deserts. They run from the United States to Mexico. The Atacama or Peruvian deserts are found in South America.\nHOT DESERTS \u2013 TEMPERATURE\nThese deserts have some of the highest temperatures on earth and experience scorching weather all year round.\nThey do not have a distinct cold weather season.\nSummertime averages are consistently above 30 degrees Celsius.\nLibya had the highest recorded temperature in 1922. The temperature increased to a maximum of 57 degrees Celsius.\nSuch high temperatures are caused by clear skies, intense insolation, dry air, and a quick rate of evaporation.\nHowever, because of the regulating effect of the seas, the coastline regions of these deserts enjoy a comparatively temperate climate. The cooling influence of cold currents also lowers the region\u2019s typical temperatures.\nThe interior regions experience extreme temperatures \u2013 hot summers and cold winters.\nThe temperature varies greatly throughout the day. The temperature rises with the sun during the day due to strong solar radiation, dry air, and clear skies.\nHowever, as soon as the sun sets, the mercury falls below the mean temperature because of the constant radiation-driven heat loss and the lack of cloud cover that would normally trap the heat.\nThe average diurnal range of temperatures is around 14 to 25 degrees centigrade.\nDuring winter nights, frost is a common occurrence.\nHOT DESERTS \u2013 PRECIPITATION\nThe average annual precipitation in these regions is not more than 25 cm.\nThese deserts are situated in the Sub-Tropical High-Pressure Belts, often referred to as the Horse Latitudes, where the air masses are descending, making it difficult for clouds that could produce precipitation to form.\nThe Trade Winds, which blow offshore and prevent any moisture-laden winds from the sea from blowing over these regions, are the dominant winds in these areas.\nOn-shore westerlies do not pass over desert areas, which lowers the likelihood of any precipitation.\nThe relative humidity of the winds that travel over deserts is reduced since they originate in cooler climates. This lessens the likelihood of water vapour condensation and consequent precipitation.\nFrom 60% in the coastal regions to less than 30% in the interior, relative humidity falls. This makes these desert regions permanently dry by increasing the rate of evaporation and decreasing the likelihood of precipitation.\nDesiccating these deserts is the result of the cold currents that travel over the west coasts of the continents. Only drier winds blow over the deserts because any sea-borne winds carrying moisture condense into mist or fog over the cold currents.\nHowever, convectional rainfall occurs in these areas for shorter periods of time in the form of intense thunderstorms. Landslides are a common and disastrous result of these abrupt downpours.\nWith less than 2 cm of annual precipitation, the Atacama Desert is the driest place on earth.\nMID-LATITUDE DESERTS \u2013 DISTRIBUTION\nThese deserts are frequently found on plateaus and are found in continental interiors.\nThey include the Gobi desert, Turkestan desert, Patagonian desert, etc.\nIn India, the Ladakh desert falls under this category.\nMID-LATITUDE DESERTS \u2013 CLIMATE\nThe world climate conditions of these deserts are comparable to those of hot deserts in many aspects.\nBecause these deserts are located far from the shore or are surrounded by high mountains, they are shut off from the moisture-laden breezes blowing from the seas.\nAverage annual precipitation does not exceed 25 cm.\nHowever, depressions may infrequently enter these Asian deserts, bringing wintertime little precipitation. Convectional precipitation is a possibility in the summer.\nThese areas see a wider range of yearly temperatures than hot deserts. Continentality, a phenomenon linked to landmasses located far from the coast, is the cause of these severe temperatures.\nThese areas have extremely cold winters with subfreezing temperatures. In rare cases, summertime ice thawing results in widespread flooding.\nDESERT VEGETATION\nAll deserts have some form of vegetation such as grass, scrub, weeds, etc.\nAlthough they may not always appear green, they are dormant and waiting for unpredictable rainfall.\nThe xerophytic or drought-resistant scrub is the most prevalent plant type in both hot and mid-latitude deserts.\nBulbous cactus, long-rooted wiry grasses, thorny bushes, and dwarf acacia are some significant species of this kind.\nClusters of date palms can be found in a few places with plenty of groundwater, particularly in hot deserts.\nThese areas support a unique species of vegetation that has evolved to withstand extreme aridity.\nDue to the lack of moisture, which decreases the pace at which organic matter decomposes, soils are lacking in humus.\nThese desert shrubs have a sophisticated network of extended roots that expand in quest of moisture. To reduce water loss through transpiration, they have few or no leaves and foliage that is hairy, waxy, or needle-shaped.\nThese plants\u2019 seeds, which have thick, hard exterior surfaces, have unique defences to keep them safe while they\u2019re dormant. They begin to sprout as soon as the rain moistens them.\nLIFE IN THE DESERTS\nDespite their inhospitable conditions, different types of human settlements have come up in these deserts\nPrimitive hunters and gatherers: These are tribes that do not domesticate any animals or grow any crops. They include the Bindibu, the Australian Aborigines, and the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert.\nNomadic herdsmen: They survive off of their herds and travel through the deserts in quest of water and lush pastures. They consist of the Mongols of the Gobi Desert, Tuaregs of the Sahara, and Arabian Bedouins.\nSettled cultivators: They have survived close to rivers such as the Nile in Egypt, Indus in Pakistan, Colorado in the USA, and Tigris-Euphrates in Iraq. They cultivate crops like wheat, barley, sugarcane, fruits, and vegetables\nMining settlers: Prominent among these include the gold mines in Australia, Diamond mines in Kalahari, Copper mines in Chile, Silver mines in Mexico, and Oil in the Persian Gulf countries.\nWorld Climate: Steppe Climate\n\nThe term steppe refers to a region that is a semi-desert with grassland or shrub vegetation.\nSteppes are intermediate regions, not receive enough rainfall to support a forest but are also not as dry as a desert.\nThe Steppe Climatic region is also known as Temperate Grasslands.\nThese grasslands are some of the most developed agricultural fields and are termed grain baskets.\nLivestock ranching is another major activity carried out in these areas due to the availability of natural grasses.\nDISTRIBUTION\nSteppes are found in the continental interiors.\nThey are usually found in temperate latitudes and hence come under the influence of Westerly winds.\nSteppes are characterized by vast grasslands which are, by and large, devoid of trees.\nSteppes typically refer to the vast temperate grasslands of Eurasia, which stretch between the Black Sea coast on the east to the Altai mountains in the west, covering a length of over 2000 miles.\nSteppes are known by their regional names in different parts of the world. They include,\nPrairies \u2013 North America\nPustaz \u2013 Hungary\nPampas \u2013 Argentina and Uruguay\nVelds (High Veld) \u2013 South Africa\nDowns \u2013 Australia\nCanterbury \u2013 New Zealand\nPRECIPITATION\nThe average annual rainfall over the steppes varies from 25 to 75 cm, depending upon the region.\nThe highest rainfall occurs in the spring season, or just prior to the onset of summer. In the northern hemisphere, it occurs in the months of June and July.\nDuring the winters, Westerlies bring in occasional depressions which often cause snowfall over these regions. However, the overall precipitation in the winter is low, at an average of 25 cm.\nIn the southern hemisphere, due to a larger influence of maritime weather, higher rainfall occurs over these regions as compared to their counterparts in the northern hemisphere.\nTEMPERATURE\nThese regions are under the effect of continentality and hence experience extremities in temperature.\nSummers are warm with the average temperature in the range of 18-20 degrees centigrade.\nWinters are usually cold with occasional snowfall.\nThe steppes in the northern hemisphere have a very high annual range of temperatures.\nIn contrast, the steppes in the southern hemisphere, due to maritime influence, have a moderate climate throughout the year.\nWINDS\nThe prevailing winds of these regions are the Westerlies, which are responsible for precipitation during the winters.\nApart from these, there are many local winds that blow over these regions and have a significant impact on the local weather.\nThey are known by various names such as Mistral (France), which is cold dry wind; Loo (Gangetic plains), Sirocco (Sahara), Foehn (Alps), etc. are warm, dry winds.\nOver the North American Prairies, the Chinook is a hot, dry local wind. Flowing from the southwest, it is a katabatic wind that is descending from the Rocky Mountains.\nIt is a scorching breeze, and in only 20 minutes it elevates the temperature in the area by more than 5 degrees centigrade.\nBecause it melts the snow covering the pastures so the animals may graze there, it is helpful for local agriculture.\nVEGETATION\nIn contrast to tropical savanna grasslands, which are interspersed with trees, temperate grasslands are nearly treeless. Furthermore, the grass in these grasslands is substantially shorter than in the savanna.\nUnlike the coarse grass found in savannas, the grass here is fresh and healthy. This is primarily true for North American prairies, as well as the Chernozem grasses of Ukraine. The prairie soils are also rich in nutrients.\nThe grass is lean, thin, and scattered.\nThis makes them suitable for ranching, or large-scale cattle husbandry.\nThe grass growing season lasts all year, despite seasonal fluctuations in temperature and precipitation.\nConifers can be found in a transitional zone of woods near the poleward spread of prairies.\nTrees are placed around croplands in steppe farmlands to protect them from severe winds.\nMediterranean Climate (Western Margin Climate)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Mediterranean climate or warm temperate western margin climate is found between 30o and 45o North and South of the Equator.\nThis climate is found in relatively few regions of the planet and is nearly entirely restricted to the western borders of continental landmasses.\nThe basic cause of this climate is the seasonal shift of the wind belts.\nDISTRIBUTION\nCentral Chile,\nCalifornia (around San Francisco),\nThe south-western tip of Africa (around Cape Town),\nSouthern Australia (in southern Victoria and\nAround Adelaide bordering St, Vincent, and Spencer Gulfs), and south-west Australia.\nCLIMATE\nThe Mediterranean climate is distinguished by its dry, warm summers and rainy, chilly winters, as well as local winds.\nDRY, WARM SUMMERS WITH OFF-SHORE TRADE WINDS\nDuring the summer, the sun is directly overhead the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.\nThe Westerlies\u2019 influence belt has drifted poleward, and rain-bearing tradewinds are expected to be off-shore.\nThus, the areas basically experience no summertime rain, remaining dry.\nThe heat is intense and the days are excessively warm.\nDurable droughts are frequent in the interior. There is typically little relative humidity.\nSummer temperatures are relatively high, with the highest recorded temperatures occurring away from the shore in the continental interiors of the Balkan peninsula, the Anatolian plateau, and the Mediterranean Middle East.\nWET, COLD WINTERS WITH ON-SHORE WESTERLIES\nDuring the winter months, the Westerlies belt swings equatorward, bringing on-shore Westerlies to the Mediterranean.\nHence, these lands receive almost all of their precipitation during the winter months.\nIn September and October in Mediterranean Europe, the rain falls in torrential downpours and causes flooding.\nLOCAL WINDS\n\nBecause of the topography of the region, which includes the Alps in the north, the Sahara desert in the south, continental interiors in the east, and the open Atlantic in the west, the Mediterranean climatic region in Europe experience several local winds. Temperature, pressure, and precipitation all vary greatly as a result. The two most important local winds are:\n\nSIROCCO\nThis is a hot, dry, and dusty wind.\nIt originates in the Sahara desert and can happen at any time of the year, but it\u2019s most common in the springtime.\nNormally it lasts only for a few days.\nIt blows into the Mediterranean Sea from the interior Saharan desert and is typically connected to Atlantic Ocean depressions.\nAlthough it is significantly cooled after crossing the Sea due to the absorption of water vapour, the heat causes the local vegetation and crops to wither.\nHence it is also called \u201cBlood Rain\u201d because it is carrying the red dust of the Sahara desert.\nMISTRAL\nMistral is a cold wind from the north.\nIt rushes down the Rhone valley, accelerating due to the valley\u2019s funnelling action between the Central Massif and the Alps [Plateau in France].\nIn very severe situations, the wind\u2019s velocity can be so strong that trains and trees can be uprooted.\nIn winter, if the Mistral is frequent the temperatures could go below the freezing point.\nOTHER LOCAL WINDS\nBora: Cold north-easterly wind along the Adriatic coast.\nTramontana and Gregale: cold winds in the Mediterranean Sea.\nNATURAL VEGETATION\nThe vegetation of the region is not luxuriant.\nTrees with small broad leaves are widely spaced.\nThis climate\u2019s distinctive lack of shade and the growth that occurs nearly exclusively in the fall and spring are other peculiarities.\nHeat, dry air, high evaporation, and protracted droughts are continuous targets of plants.\nHence they are generally xerophytic or drought resistant in nature.\nTYPES OF MEDITERRANEAN VEGETATION:\n\nThe vegetation consists of Evergreen forests, evergreen coniferous forests, grass, bushes and shrubs.\n\nEVERGREEN FORESTS\nThey are open forests with evergreen oaks, only found in climatically favourable areas with annual precipitation of over 25 inches.\nThe cork oaks are used for making wine-bottle corks.\nIn Australia, the eucalyptus forests replace the evergreen oak.\nThe giant sequoia or redwood is typical of Californian trees.\nEVERGREEN CONIFEROUS FORESTS\nThey include various kinds of pines, firs, cedars, and cypresses.\nWhere there are fewer severe droughts and higher temperatures, they are more common.\nBUSHES AND SHRUBS\nThis is the most prominent type of Mediterranean vegetation.\nThe low bushes grow in scattered clumps and are often thorny.\nGRASS\nBecause most of the rain falls during the cool season, when development is slow, the conditions in this region are unsuitable for grass.\nThey are generally wiry and bunchy and are not suitable for animal farming.\nThus cattle rearing is not an important occupation in the Mediterranean\nWarm Temperate Eastern Margin Climate\n\nIt is located near the eastern edges of the continents between 20 and 35 N and S latitude.\nThe region has a monsoonal climate, with rain in the summer and dry weather in the winter.\nVARIATIONS OF WARM TEMPERATE EASTERN MARGIN CLIMATE\nChina Type: Temperate monsoon or China type is found in most parts of China and is a modified form of monsoonal climate.\nGulf Type:\u00a0Though less pronounced, the overall climate resembles the China Type. It is found in the southeastern parts of the USA bordering the Gulf of Mexico. The continental heating during summers induces an inflow of air from the cooler Atlantic Ocean.\nNatal Type: In Southern Hemisphere, this climate is witnessed in New South Wales, Natal, and Parana-Paraguay-Uruguay basin. This is often referred to as the Natal Type of climate and is influenced by the on-shore Trade winds all around the year.\nCLIMATE\nIt is typified by a warm moist summer and a cool, dry winter.\nOccasionally, the penetration of cold air from the continental interiors may bring down the temperature to the freezing point.\nThe relative humidity is a little high in mid-summer but most of the time, the climate is pleasantly warm.\nRainfall is more than moderate and ranges between 60 cm to 150 cm and there is a uniform distribution of temperature throughout the year.\nRain comes either from convectional sources or as orographic rain in summer, or from depressions in prolonged showers in winter.\nLocal storms also occur. Examples: typhoons, and hurricanes.\nThe rainfall is adequate for all agricultural purposes and hence the areas are densely populated.\nCHINA TYPE\nIt is the most typical of the warm temperate eastern margin climate.\nIn summer due to intense heating of the continental interiors of the heart of Asia including Tibet, a low-pressure system is set in which attracts the tropical Pacific air stream.\nThis is witnessed as the South-East monsoon in the region.\nIn winter, there is intense high pressure over Siberia and the continental polar air stream flows outwards as the North-West Monsoon, bitterly cold and very dry.\nThere is little rain but there is considerable snow.\nThe region also experiences intense tropical cyclones called typhoons that originate in the Pacific Ocean and are most frequent in the late summer.\nTHE GULF TYPE\nThe Gulf-Atlantic regions of the USA experience this type of climate similar to the China type but with less monsoonal characteristics.\nThe warm Gulf Stream and the on-shore Trade winds help bring down the range of temperatures and there is a heavy annual rainfall of around 59 inches.\nThe amount of rain is increased by thunderstorms in summer and by hurricanes in September and October.\nDue to intense local heating, the region also experiences violent tornadoes leading to heavy destruction.\nNATAL TYPE\nThe narrowness of the continents and the dominance of maritime influence eliminate the monsoonal elements.\nThe South-East Trade winds bring about a more even distribution of rainfall throughout the year.\nThe annual range of temperature is low and rain comes in prolonged showers.\nNATURAL VEGETATION\nDue to heavier rainfall, the region supports luxurious vegetation.\nThere is perennial plant growth and the conditions are well-suited to a rich variety of plant life.\nThe lowlands carry both evergreen broad-leaved forests and deciduous trees, similar to the tropical monsoon forests.\nIn the highlands, are various species of conifers such as pines and cypresses which are important softwoods.\nEastern Australia \u2013 Eucalyptus\nSouth-Eastern Brazil, eastern Paraguay, north-eastern Argentina \u2013 Parana pine, the quebracho, wild yerba mate trees.\nNatal: palm trees\nWorld Climate: British Type Climate\n\nBritish-type climatic regions are under the permanent influence of the Westerlies all around the year.\nThese are also regions of high cyclonic activity., typical of Britain and thus said to experience the British climate.\nThis climate is also referred to as the cool temperate western margin climate or the North-west European Maritime Climate.\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nThere are exists of the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere distributions.\n\nNORTHERN HEMISPHERE\nThe climatic belt stretches from Britain into North-West Europe, including northern and western France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, western Norway, and also north-western Iberia.\nIt primarily affects the coastlands of British Columbia in North America. The North American Rockies prohibit on-shore Westerlies from penetrating far inland.\nSOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\nThe majority of New Zealand, especially the South Island, Tasmania, southern Chile, and southern Australia all enjoy this climate.\nThe surrounding wide stretches of water have made these areas\u2019 climates more marine.\nCLIMATE\nMild winters and moderately warm summers. Temperature extremes are unlikely.\nAdequate rainfall throughout the year.\nTEMPERATURE\nThe mean annual temperature is usually in the range of 5 C \u2013 15 C.\nThis range is comparatively small for such high latitudes.\nWinters are unusually mild with no station recording temperatures below freezing, while summers are seldom particularly warm.\nThe North Atlantic Drift\u2019s warming influence and the South-Westerlies\u2019 predominance are to blame for this.\nHence, they are some of the most advanced regions of the world.\nPRECIPITATION\nAdequate rainfall throughout the year.\nFrom cyclonic sources, there is a propensity for a tepid winter or autumn maximum.\nThe western edges have the most rainfall because the rain-bearing winds originate in the west.\nMoving eastward from the sea, the amount of rainfall diminishes.\nSEASONS\nThere are four distinct seasons.\nThe long, sunny summers are followed by the roar of the wind-filled autumn.\nWinter is a season marked by overcast skies, foggy mornings, and numerous days with rain brought on by cyclonic depressions.\nThe driest and most pleasant season after the gloomy winter is spring, and then the cycle repeats itself.\n\nAlso read: Seasons in India\n\nNATURAL VEGETATION\nThe natural vegetation of this climatic type is the deciduous forest.\nIn the winter, trees lose their foliage. This modification serves as a defence against winter snow and ice.\nAutumnal or fall-related shedding starts and is dispersed by the winds.\nSome of the common species of temperate hardwood include oak, elm, ash, birch, beech, hornbeam, and poplar.\nIn the wetter areas grow willows, alder, and aspen.\nThe deciduous trees grow in pristine stands and have significant logging value from a business standpoint.\nThe sparse undergrowth is useful in logging operations.\nThe deciduous hardwoods are great for industrial and fuel uses.\nThe conifers, which can endure a higher altitude, a lower temperature, and poorer soils, typically replace the deciduous trees further up the mountains in the Scandinavian highlands, the Rockies, the southern Andes, and the Southern Alps of New Zealand.\nWorld Climate: Taiga Climate (Coniferous Forests & Lumbering)\n\nTaiga Climate is sometimes referred to as the Cool Temperate Continental Climate and is also known as Siberian Climate and Boreal Climate.\nDue to the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s little populated landmass, this sort of climate is primarily seen in the Northern Hemisphere.\nKoppen has defined the Taiga Climatic region as D type in his climatic classification.\nAccording to Koppen\u2019s classification, the winter temperature can drop below 3 degrees C while the summer months can be pleasant with temperatures over 10 degrees C.\nDISTRIBUTION\nIt spans central Canada, the majority of central and southern Russia, and certain areas of Scandinavia from 50 to 70 N along a continuous strip.\nAround the Arctic Circle, it combines with the Arctic tundra of Canada and Eurasia to the north or poleward. The \u201cSubarctic climate\u201d is another name for this environment.\nIn the south, the climate becomes less severe and merges into the temperate Steppe climate.\nDue to the narrowness of the continents at high latitudes, the Siberian climate is absent in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe Southern Hemisphere\u2019s considerable maritime influence lessens the severity of the winter.\nCLIMATE\n\nIn the Taiga climate region, the summers can be moderate or cool, while the winters can be quite cold because of the polar and Arctic air masses\u2019 strong winds and snowstorms.\n\nTEMPERATURE\nThese areas have exceptionally cold winters that last for a very long time and have temperatures between \u2013 30 C and \u2013 40 C.\nThe summers are cool and brief. Spring and autumn are very brief and transitional periods.\nThe annual range of temperature is very high, almost 50 C to 60 C.\nThe coolest place on earth, Verkhoyansk is situated in this climatic region.\nIn this location, significant snowfall and frosts are frequent due to the year-round extremely low temperatures.\nRivers and lakes are frozen, while arctic winds to the north, like the Buran and Blizzards of Eurasia, blow ferociously.\nSiberian climate zones have extremely scarce populations due to the harsh conditions.\nPRECIPITATION\nThe interiors have almost no maritime influences, which results in low annual precipitation, often between 38 and 63 cm.\nIt falls evenly throughout the year, with a summer peak from convectional rain as the continental interiors heat up.\nIn winter, the precipitation is in the form of snow.\nNATURAL VEGETATION\nThe predominant vegetation of this region is evergreen coniferous forests.\nConifers are highly adapted to this environment and can resist such harsh conditions.\nThe greatest single band of the coniferous forest is the taiga in Siberia.\nThe region\u2019s coniferous forests mostly consist of pine, fir, spruce, and larch trees.\nThe richest sources of softwood are the coniferous forest belts in North America and Eurasia.\n\nConiferous forests are of huge commercial value due to the following reasons:\n\nThey occur in pure stands and there exist only a few species.\nConiferous woods occur at consistent heights, grow straight and tall, and are of moderate density, in contrast to the dense and challenging-to-exploit equatorial rain forests.\nAlmost all conifers are evergreen. There is no annual replacement of new leaves as in deciduous trees.\nEvergreens greatly benefit from the low yearly temperatures, with more than half of the year being below the growing-point temperature.\nConifers have a conical shape, which allows them to live in the subarctic climate.\nThe sloping branches discourage snow build-up and provide weak wind support.\nLeaves are small, thick, leathery, and needle-shaped to check excessive transpiration.\nPoorly podzolized soils in the area cause undergrowth because they are highly acidic and leached.\nEvergreen forests don\u2019t have falling leaves, thus there is limited humus development and the leathery needles take a long time to decompose because of the cold temperatures.\nOther obstacles to sparse vegetation include the lack of direct sunshine and the brief summer season.\nConiferous forests are also found in areas with high altitudes and low temperatures in addition to the continental interiors of high latitudes. In the Himalayas, for instance.\nWorld Climate: Laurentian Climate\n\nThe Cool Temperate Eastern Margin climate is also known as the Laurentian climate.\nIt is the intermediate between the British and Siberian types of climates.\nDISTRIBUTION\nIt is found only in two regions and only in the northern hemisphere.\nThe climate combines elements of the coastal and continental climates.\nNorth American region:\u00a0One region is north-eastern North America including eastern Canada, north-east USA, and Newfoundland.\nAsiatic region:\u00a0The other region is the eastern coastlands of Asia, including North China, eastern Siberia, Manchuria, Korea, and northern Japan.\nDue to the little amount of continental landmass that extends south of latitude 40 S, the climate is completely missing in the southern hemisphere.\nThe only possible regions are in eastern Patagonia.\nHowever, the Southern Andes obstruct the westerlies, making the area arid rather than continental.\nOnly 10 inches of precipitation fall there annually due to its rain-shadow status.\nTEMPERATURE\nThe climate of this type has cold, dry winters and warm, wet summers.\nWinter temperatures can be well below freezing, and snowfall can reach quite a depth.\nThe off-shore cold currents from the Arctic helped to temper down the summers, which are as warm as those in the tropics.\nPRECIPITATION\nRain falls throughout the year.\nThe easterly winds from the oceans do, however, bring rain, thus there is a noticeable summer maximum.\nTwo-thirds of the annual precipitation is in summer.\nDry, chilly winds from the interiors of the continent blow during the winter.\nNATURAL VEGETATION\nThe predominant vegetation in this climate is cool temperate forests.\nTrees thrive best in regions with high rainfall, mild summers, and damp air from fogs.\nForest tends to be coniferous north of the 50 N latitude.\nSouth of this latitude, deciduous forests is seen.\nWorld Climate: Polar Climate (Tundra & Ice Caps)\n\nThe polar climate has cold climatic conditions all through the year.\nIn his climatic classification, Koppen (World climate classification) categorised Polar Climate as E type.\nKoppen (World climate classification) claims that the area\u2019s summer temperature is less than 10 degrees. Polar Tundra and Polar Ice Caps were his additional divisions of the polar climate.\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nThere are exists of the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere distributions.\n\nNORTHERN HEMISPHERE\nIn the northern hemisphere, the polar climate is mostly found north of the Arctic Circle.\nThe ice caps are only found in Greenland and highlands at high latitudes where the ground is always covered in snow.\nThe lowlands which are ice-free for a few months have tundra vegetation.\nThis comprises the Arctic seaboard of Eurasia, the Greenlandic coastal strip, and the desolate regions of northern Canada and Alaska.\nSOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\nThe largest single ice cap where the layers of permanent ice are visible in the southern hemisphere is found in Antarctica, an uninhabited continent.\nTEMPERATURE\nA very low mean annual temperature characterizes the tundra or polar temperature.\nThere are just four months with temperatures above freezing. With the exception of four months, the ground is always frozen.\nInteriors are much colder than in the coastal regions.\nWinters are long and very severe, and summers are cool and brief.\nThere are weeks of nonstop darkness outside the Arctic and Antarctic circles.\nFrosts and blizzards that occur are very hazardous to the polar inhabitants.\nPRECIPITATION\nIn the winter, precipitation primarily takes the form of snow, which is drifting by blizzards.\nConvectional rainfall is generally absent because of the low rate of evaporation and the lack of moisture in the cold polar air.\nIn summer, there is a maximum and the precipitation is in the form of rain or sleet.\nCyclones are felt in the coastal areas and there is a tendency towards a winter maximum.\nNATURAL VEGETATION\nIn severe environments like that of Tundra, few plants survive.\nThe greatest inhibiting factor is the lack of heat and energy.\nThe growing season is for less than three months and there are no trees in the tundra.\nHence only the lowest forms of vegetation are supported like mosses, lichens, and sedges.\nIn the more sheltered spots, stunted birches, dwarf willows, and undersized alders struggle to survive.\nIn the brief summers when snow melts and the days are warmer and longer, berry bushes and Arctic flowers bloom.\nThey are short-lived but they brighten the monotonous polar landscape into Arctic prairies.\n\nThe most widely used classification of world climate is the empirical world climate classification scheme developed by Wladimir Koppen.

These are complex paths.\nThe water is afterward released back into the atmosphere.\nThe fact that the hydrologic cycle has no beginning and no end is a basic aspect of it.\n\nAccording to studies, over 90% of the moisture in our atmosphere comes from the evaporation of oceans, seas, and other bodies of water (lakes, rivers, and streams), which is the process by which water transforms from a liquid to a gas.\n\nPlants release the majority of the remaining 10% that is found in the atmosphere through transpiration. Water is absorbed by plants through their roots, and it is then expelled through tiny pores on the underside of their leaves.\n\nIn addition, a tiny amount of water vapor is released into the atmosphere as a result of sublimation, which is the direct transformation of water from a solid (ice or snow) to a gas.\n\nWhen the temperature remains below freezing, sublimation causes snow banks to gradually diminish.\n\nStages of the hydrologic cycle\nImage: National Weather Service\n\nEvaporation, condensation, precipitation, interception, infiltration, percolation, transpiration, runoff, and storage are a few of the processes.\n\nEvaporation\n\nA material changes from a liquid to a gas through evaporation. In meteorology, water is the element that concerns us the most.\n\nThe process of evaporation needs the energy to occur. The sun, the atmosphere, the planet, or anything on the earth like people are all potential sources of energy. Everyone has first-hand experience with evaporation.\n\nThe body sweats, secreting water onto the skin when it becomes hot due to the atmospheric temperature or due to exertion. The idea is to get the body to use its heat to make the liquid evaporate, taking the heat out and cooling the body. It has a similar effect to what you experience after exiting a shower or swimming pool.\n\nTranspiration\n\nWater from plants evaporates through stomata during transpiration.\n\nSmall apertures called stomata, which are related to vascular plant tissues can be seen on the underside of leaves.\n\nThe atmosphere\u2019s humidity and the soil\u2019s moisture content play a significant role in controlling the passive process of transpiration in the majority of plants.\n\nOnly 1% of the water lost during transpiration by a plant is utilized for the plant\u2019s growth. 99.9% of it is released into the atmosphere.\n\nCondensation\n\nCondensation is the process by which atmospheric water vapor transforms into a liquid state. Condensation in the atmosphere can take the form of clouds or dew.\n\nThe dewpoint temperature and the air temperature are two different temperatures that must differ for condensation to occur. The dew point, in its simplest form, is the temperature at which dew can develop.\n\nIt is the temperature that causes the air to become saturated if it is cooled to that point. Water vapor condenses with any further cooling. When the dew point and air temperature are the same, foggy conditions frequently develop.\n\nCondensation is the opposite of evaporation. Since water vapor has a higher energy level than that liquid water, when condensation occurs, excess energy in the form of heat energy is released. This release of heat aids in the formation of hurricanes.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nWhen the tiny condensation particles grow too large through collision and coalescence for the rising air to support, they form precipitation and fall to the ground. There may be precipitation in the form of snow, sleet, hail, or rain.\n\nOn Earth, precipitation is the main source of fresh water. Overland and oceans alike, the world receives roughly 38 1/2\u2033 (980 mm) of precipitation per year.\n\nRunoff\n\nWhen the earth is saturated and there has been a lot of precipitation, runoff occurs (cannot absorb any more water). Runoff causes rivers and lakes to form. Although some runoff evaporation occurs in the atmosphere, most of the water in rivers and lakes flows back into the oceans.\n\nEvaporation is the sole way for runoff water to return to the atmosphere if the lake is the only place where it flows (there is no exit for the water to flow out of the lake). Salts or contaminants are left behind as water evaporates. The lake then turns salty, much like the Great Salt Lake in Utah or the Dead Sea in Israel.\n\nThis runoff evaporates into the atmosphere, restarting the hydrologic cycle.\n\nAlso read: Atmospheric River\n\nHydrologic cycle and water storage\n\nIn the planetary water cycle, water is stored primarily in three different places- the sky, the earth\u2019s surface, and the ground.\n\nFrom one area of the earth to another, water that is stored in the atmosphere can be transported rather quickly.\n\nThe kinds of storage that take place on the surface of the land and underground mostly depend on the geologic factors associated with the different kinds of soil and rocks that are present where the storage is taking place.\n\nOceans, lakes, reservoirs, and glaciers are examples of surface storage, while soil, aquifers, and cracks in rock formations are examples of subsurface storage.\n\nWater can travel erratically through the eight additional primary physical stages of the water cycle.\n\nThe water in the atmosphere gets replaced every 16 days on average.\nEach year, the soil moisture is roughly replaced. Waters in wetlands are replenished on average every five years, whereas lake water stays in one area for almost seventeen years.\nGroundwater regeneration can last more than 1,400 years in places where society has not yet fully developed.\nExtreme occurrences like floods and droughts can occur as a result of the uneven flow and distribution of water throughout time, as well as the spatial distribution of water in both geographic and geologic locations.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Atmospheric River\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Although some are made of land and others of more granular particles, such as sand, they all link two land masses together and have water on both sides.\nIsthmuses have been strategic locations for centuries. They are natural sites for ports and canals linking terrestrial and aquatic trade routes.\nIsthmuses are also key sites for communications and cultural exchange, as well as military outposts.\nIsthmus vs land bridge vs peninsula\nIsthmus\u00a0and\u00a0land bridge\u00a0are related terms, with isthmus having a broader meaning.\nAn isthmus bridging the largest geographic masses on Earth is known as a land bridge. The phrase \u201cland bridge\u201d is typically used in biogeology to refer to land linkages that once existed across continents and were significant for human migration as well as that of numerous animal and plant species, such as Beringia and Doggerland.\nA peninsula is more of a land protrusion that is connected to a larger landmass on one side alone and completely surrounded by the ocean on the other. An isthmus is a land connection between two larger land masses.\nTechnically, an isthmus can resemble two peninsulas because of canals that stretch from coast to coast (such as the Panama Canal), but canals are man-made features as opposed to straits.\nMajor isthmuses in the world\nIsthmus of Panama:\nThe Pacific and Atlantic Oceans are divided by the Isthmus of Panama in Panama, which also connects the continents of North and South America.\nThe Panama Canal, which spans the isthmus for 77 kilometres (48 miles), enables freight ships to pass directly from eastern to western North America without having to sail around South America.\nThe Panama Canal revolutionised shipping and travel in the 20th century by making it possible for goods and people to be transported more quickly and effectively.\nIsthmus of Suez:\nThe Mediterranean and Red Seas are divided by the Isthmus of Suez, which is located in eastern Egypt.\nThe 192 km (119 mi) long Suez Canal allows cargo ships to pass through Africa and directly transit between Europe, North Africa, Western Asia (through the Mediterranean Sea in the north), and Eastern and Southern Asia.\nIn the 19th century, the Suez Canal boosted trade and travel; it still shapes the oil trade today.\nThe\u00a0city of\u00a0Seattle:\nSeattle, Washington, is situated on an isthmus that connects Lake Washington and Puget Sound, a region of the Pacific Ocean.\nOver 4,000 years have passed since there has been continuous habitation in the area. The Duabish and the Hachuabish were the first people to settle in the region, respectively, close to the seashore and a freshwater lake.\nThese Native Americans were collectively known as the Duwamish by European settlers who saw the isthmus\u2019 potential for trade both across the Pacific and along North America\u2019s west coast.\nMount Maunganui- A tombolo town:\nThe tombolo town of Mount Maunganui, New Zealand, is situated on a sandbar that connects the mainland to the volcanic island of Mauao.\nAn extinct volcano, Mauao is a well-liked location for beach hopping and climbing. Because of the tombolo formation, such beaches have a variety of alternatives.\nThe beaches facing Tauranga Harbor on the isthmus of Mount Maunganui are tranquil and safe. Beaches on the opposite side of Mount Maunganui face the Pacific Ocean, which has imposing waves that are well-liked by surfers.\nRock of Gibraltar- Most famous tombolo:\nThe Rock of Gibraltar, a linked island that is just barely connected to the southwest tip of Europe\u2019s Iberian Peninsula, is arguably the most well-known tombolo.\nThe \u201cPillars of Hercules,\u201d which make up the confined western entrance to the Mediterranean Sea, are joined at their northernmost points by the Rock of Gibraltar.\nSince the Phoenicians, the Rock of Gibraltar has been a vital location for traders and explorers due to its advantageous location.\nAlthough it is now a part of British Gibraltar, the Rock of Gibraltar borders Spain.\nSome other major Isthmus in the world\u00a0:\nThe world\u2019s major Isthmus of Tehuantepec is in Middle America.\nOf historic importance were the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece and the Isthmus of Catanzaro in Italy.\nThe Isthmus of Mansheya connects Egypt\u2019s island of Pharos to the city of Alexandria on the country\u2019s mainland.\nThe Isthmus of Kra links the Malay Peninsula with mainland of Asia.\nThe Isthmus of Kushimoto in Japan joins Cape Shiono-Misaki and Honsh\u016b.\nIn the Quezon Province of Luzon in the Phillippines, the Tayabas Isthmus unites the mainland of Luzon with the Bicol Peninsula.\nAdam\u2019s Bridge, also known as Rama\u2019s Bridge, is an isthmus that connects Sri Lanka and India.\nThe Karelian Isthmus is found between Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland (the Baltic Sea).\nIn the northern portion of Russia, Olonets Isthmus is located between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega, and Onega Isthmus lies between Lake Onega and the White Sea.\nCanals built across the major Isthmus in the world\nIt is common practice to construct canals across isthmuses, where they may provide a particularly useful marine transportation shortcut.\nFor instance, the Panama Canal connects the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by passing through the Panama Isthmus;\nBy traversing the western side of the Sinai Peninsula-created Isthmus of Suez, the Suez Canal links the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea; & the Crinan Canal connects the Kintyre peninsula to the rest of Scotland by spanning the isthmus between Loch Crinan and Loch Gilp.\nThe Welland Canal in the Niagara Peninsula serves as another illustration (technically an isthmus). It links Lake Ontario and Lake Erie together. On New Zealand\u2019s North Island, the city of Auckland is located on an isthmus.\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

    "[CONTENT] #285": "Coastal Erosion is wearing away and redistributing solid elements of the shoreline as well as sediment.\n\nIn most cases, coastal erosion is caused by natural forces including waves, tidal and littoral currents, and deflation.\n\nA substantial percentage of the Indian population, about 20% lives along the coast, and developmental activities have put tremendous pressure on the fragile coastal environment.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCurrent Status of Coastal Erosion\nCauses of Coastal Erosion\nNatural Causes\nMan-Made Causes\nCoastal Erosion Protection Measures\nNon-structural measures\nStructural Measures\nCombination of the Structural and Non-Structural Measures\nSuccessful Coastal Erosion Mitigation Measures\nShoreline Change Atlas of Indian Coast\nConclusion\nCurrent Status of Coastal Erosion\n\nRecently, the Ministry of Earth Sciences informed that a sizable portion of the 6,907.18 km long Indian coastline of the mainland is under varying degrees of Coastal erosion.\n\nApproximately 34% of the coastline is under varying degrees of erosion, 26% is accreting, and the remaining 40% is stable.\n\nOver the years from 1990 to 2018, West Bengal experienced erosion along around 60.5% (323.07 km) of its coastline followed by \u00a0Kerala (46.4%) and Tamil Nadu (42.7%).\n\nEarlier, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) published an atlas of Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) maps for the entire Indian coastline.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCauses of Coastal Erosion\n\nThere are several causes of coastal erosion that can be a result of either natural or man-made activities. Sometimes, it is a combination of both natural and man-made factors.\n\nNatural causes are often not possible to resist or avoid but the damage caused by man-made reasons is the result of ill-planned activities. The effects of climate change, sea-level rise and other long-term causes of erosion are still unaccounted for.\n\nNatural Causes\n\nWaves, winds, tides, near-shore currents, storms, sea level rise, etc. are examples of natural factors that affect coastal erosion.\n\nAlso, the natural variation in the supply of sediments to the coastline from the river can affect the erosion of the coastline.\n\nAn increasing sea level will promote shoreline setbacks.\n\nAnother factor is the subsidence occurrence. Subsidence is a regional phenomenon that reduces a region\u2019s surface area. It has similar effects on the coastline to sea level rise.\n\nSevere storms, tidal surges, and cyclones are examples of catastrophic events that create abnormally high sea levels and significant erosion.\n\nMan-Made Causes\n\nThe majority of erosion that is caused by humans is a result of human interference with both the rivers\u2019 sediment load and the natural transportation process. Coastal defence buildings, river management projects, sand and aggregate mining, oil and gas exploration (which results in long-term subsidence), and ports and harbours that affect sediment flow are examples of human activity.\n\nAlso read: Erosion and Deposition: Action of Running Water and Groundwater\n\nCoastal Erosion Protection Measures\n\nCoastal protection measures moderate the long-term average erosion rate of shoreline change. Nature not only erodes but also has the capacity to protect. Protection of the coastline from erosion is provided by nature in the form of a stable beach, capable of dissipating incident wave energy. Nature\u2019s coastal protection is also demonstrated at the headlands, reefs, shores, dunes, etc.\n\nThe measure to control erosion includes non-structural and structural or their combination. A brief description of these measures is given below:\n\nNon-structural measures\n\nThe non-structural measures try to dissipate wave energy by mirroring natural forces and preserving the coast\u2019s natural topography. These actions are frequently referred to as soft solutions. These include:\n\nArtificial nourishment of beaches\nCoastal vegetation such as mangrove and palm plantation\nSand bypassing at tidal inlets\nDune reconstruction/rehabilitation\nStructural Measures\n\nStructural measures are also known as hard structural or engineering measures. It includes the use of physical structures constructed near the coast to prevent or restrict water from reaching the potential damage areas. These solutions influence the coastal processes to reduce the rate of coastal erosion.\n\nThe structural measures used for coastal erosion prevention include seawalls, revetment, breakwaters, off-shore groins, groynes, offshore reefs, artificial headland, etc.\n\nCombination of the Structural and Non-Structural Measures\n\nThe combination of Structural and Non-Structural Measures to control coastal erosion gives synergetic outcomes and provides an environmentally and economically acceptable coastal protection system.\n\nThe hard solutions have a wide range of drawbacks, including the fact that they are expensive, lead to erosion, and occasionally damage the aesthetic value of the site, lowering its economic value. It should be mentioned that soft solutions are not quick fixes, they take time to work, and they only do so from a medium- to long-term perspective.\n\nThese combinations act as interim hard structures and some of the common approaches of combinations are:\n\nCombining beach nourishment with artificial\nHeadlands or groynes\nRevegetation with temporary offshore breakwaters/ artificial reefs is commonly used.\nSuccessful Coastal Erosion Mitigation Measures\n\nA few success examples are:\n\nPuducherry Beach Restoration Project, Puducherry\n\nThe Submerged Reef has been implemented by MoES and beach nourishment is implemented by Govt of Puducherry. This helped in the restoration of a 1.5 km long city beach after 30 years and helped in improving tourism and fishing activities in addition to protection of the coast during extreme cyclonic events.\n\n\u00a0Kadalur Periya Kuppam, Tamil Nadu\n\nAn Offshore submerged dyke was implemented. This helped in the protection of three fishing Villages during extreme cyclonic events and restored the lost beach that is being used for the landing of fishing boats and other fishing activities.\n\nShoreline Change Atlas of Indian Coast\n\nThe Coastal Protection and Development Advisory Committee (CPDAC), which was established by the Department of Water Resources, River Development, and Ganga Rejuvenation (Govt. of India) suggested a coastal atlas showing data on coastal erosion derived from satellite data and protection measures implemented by all maritime states of India.\n\nAs a result, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), in coordination with Central Water Commission, launched a project titled \u201cShoreline Change Atlas of the Indian Coast\u201d at the behest of the Coastal Management Directorate.\n\nThis Atlas comprises shoreline change maps prepared using satellite data for 2004-06 and 2014-16 time-frame for the entire country. The maps indicate the status of the coastal protection measures implemented by maritime States/UTs as well as the eroding, stable, and accreting coasts.\n\nConclusion\n\nSea level rise, variations in storm frequency and intensity, increases in precipitation, and warmer ocean temperatures all have an impact on coasts. In addition, when atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations rise, the seas take in more of the gas, contributing to ocean acidification. The coastal and marine ecosystems may well be significantly impacted by this increase in acidity.\n\nWe are aware that coastline erosion is a complicated and important issue for a large country like ours. Efforts are being undertaken to counter the threat of coastal erosion and protect our coastlines using both the traditional ways (using hard structures like a seawall, etc.) and also the new, innovative soft measures like dune rehabilitation.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

The Indus River System, a Himalayan river system, is one of the world\u2019s largest river basins.\n\nAround this river, \u201cThe Indus Valley Civilization\u201d first emerged.\n\nSindhu is another name for the Indus River. As a result, the Sindhu River System is a component of one of the world\u2019s and the Indian subcontinent\u2019s most fertile regions.\n\nThe river passes through Pakistan, India, and China\u2019s Tibetan areas. It is referred to as Singi Khambai or Lion\u2019s mouth in Tibet.\n\nThe Indus River System consists of the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Satluj, and is made up of the principal tributaries of the Indus River. The Indus water pact was established in 1960 to share water because the Indus River passes through both India and Pakistan.\n\nAccording to the Indus Water Treaty of 1960, the rivers Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab are under the control of Pakistan, while the rivers Rabi, Beas, and Satluj are under the control of India. Through the canal, the Indus River System also reaches Rajasthan and Haryana.\n\nIndus River System\n\nIt comes from a glacier in Bokhar Chu in the Tibetan area, located at an elevation of 4,164 m, in the Kailash Mountain range close to Mansarovar Lake.\n\nThe river originates in an area called Demchok and runs northwest before joining the Ladakh region of India. The Indus River flows between the Ladakh and Karakoram ranges but is more closely situated to the latter.\n\nThe other Himalayan tributaries of the Indus include Gilgit, Garstang, Dras, Shiger, and Hunza. After passing through Gilgit, the river makes a southerly bend before turning west and entering Khyber Pakhtunkhawa, Pakistan\u2019s northwest frontier province.\n\nThe collected waters of the five eastern tributaries\u2014the Jhelum, the Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas, and the Satluj\u2014arrive at the Indus from Panjnad (Panchnad) just before Mithankot.\n\nIts principal left-bank tributaries include the Zaskar River, Suru River, Soan River, Jhelum River, Chenab River, Ravi River, Beas River, Satluj River, and Panjnad River.\n\nIts principal right-bank tributaries include the Shyok River, Gilgit River, Hunza River, Swat River, Kunnar River, Kurram River, Gomal River, and Kabul River.\n\nRiver Chenab\n\nThe Bara Lacha Pass area of the Lahul-Spiti section of the Zaskar Range is where the Chenab originates. In the upper Himalayas in the Lahul and Spiti District of Himachal Pradesh, the confluence of the Chandra and Bhaga rivers at Tandi creates the Chenab River.\n\nIt is also referred to as the Chandrabhaga in its upper reaches. According to the Indus Water Treaty, Pakistan is given access to the Chenab\u2019s waters.\n\nThe world\u2019s tallest railroad bridge, known as Chenab Bridge, spans the river in J&K. It passes through the Jammu area of J&K before entering Pakistan\u2019s Punjab plains.\n\nRiver Sutlej\n\nSometimes, Sutlej is referred to as the red river. It begins beyond the Indian border on the southern slopes of the Kailash Mountain, not far from Mansarovar Lake and Rakas Lake.\n\nThe river flows south-westerly through the districts of Kinnaur, Shimla, Kullu, Solan, Mandi, and Bilaspur before entering HP at Shipki La.\n\nSutlej exits Himachal and enters the Punjabi plains near Bhakra. Here the highest gravity dam in the world, the Bhakra Nangal Dam, has been built.\n\nAccording to the Indus Water Treaty between India and Pakistan, India is given access to the Sutlej River\u2019s waters, mostly used for power generation and irrigation of numerous major canals.\n\nRiver Beas\n\nRohtang pass in HP is where the Beas Watercourse, a vital river of the Indus River System, originates. At Hari-Ke-Pattan in Punjab, the river combines with the Sutlej River before entering Pakistan.\n\nIt travels through the Dhaola Dhar mountain range before turning southwest and merging with the Satluj river in Harike in Punjab.\n\nIt is a relatively little river, barely 460 km long, and wholly located within Indian territory. Manali\u2019s tourist resorts are on the River Beas\u2019s right bank.\n\nRiver Ravi\n\nThe Kullu Hills near the Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh is where the Ravi originates. It drains the region between the Pir Panjal and the Dhaola Dhar peaks and flows between the Pir Panjal and Dhauladhar Ranges\u2019 Shahdara Bagh, home to Jahangir\u2019s and Noor Jahan\u2019s tombs\n\nIt turns southwest after crossing Chamba and carves a deep valley in the Dhaola Dhar mountain. Near Madhopur, it reaches the Punjab Plains before moving to Pakistan below Amritsar.\n\nIn Pakistani Punjab, it empties into the Chenab just above Rangpur.\n\nRiver Jhelum\n\nIn the southeast corner of the Kashmir Valley, at Verinag, spring serves as the Jhelum\u2019s source. It empties into Wular Lake from the north (north-western part of Kashmir Valley). It shifts its path southward from Wular Lake. The river flows into a gorge in the hills of Baramulla.\n\nBelow Baramula, the river carves out a slender valley through the Pir Panjal Range. The river makes a tight zigzag curve southward at Muzaffarabad.\n\nFollowing that, it creates the border between India and Pakistan for 170 km before emerging at the Potwar Plateau close to Mirpur.\n\nIt debouches (emerges from a confined space into a broad, open area) into the plains close to the city of Jhelum after running through the spurs of the Salt Range.\n\nAt Trimmu, it connects to the Chenab.\n\nArticle written by Elizabeth",

The Bastar, Telangana, and Karnataka plateaus\u2019 tips, as well as the Tamil Nadu uplands, are located to the west.\nIts eastern portion is constrained by the Eastern Coastal area.\nThe Eastern Ghats span southern Tamil Nadu, passing through sections of Karnataka, from northern Odisha through Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\nMountains in the Eastern Ghats\nThe tallest mountain in the Eastern Ghats is Jindhagada, located near Araku, Andhra Pradesh.\nSouthwest, the hills become more gentle as the Godavari River cuts through a gorge that is 65 kilometres (40 miles) long.\nThe Eastern Ghats can be seen as a collection of low ranges and hills, including the Erramala, Nallamala, Velikonda, and Palkonda, further southwest, beyond the Krishna River.\nThe Eastern Ghats continue as the Javadi and Shevaroy hills to the southwest of Chennai (Madras), where they converge with the Western Ghats.\nDue to fractured hills, the Eastern Ghats\u2019 altitude is uneven from a topographic perspective. The typical altitude is 600 m. (2000 ft).\nRivers flowing through\nThe Eastern Ghats are intervein by major rivers like the Godavari, Krishna and Pennar.\nA number of small rivers rise in the Eastern Ghats and debit into the Bay of Bengal.\nThree major lakes present are Chilka, Kolleru and Pulicat lakes.\nThe climate of Eastern Ghats\nRed, Black, Laterite, and Alluvial soils are the most common types of soil in the Eastern Ghats.\nThe region\u2019s mean annual temperature ranges from a low of 14.5 \u00b0C to a high of 36.5 \u00b0C.\nThe tropical monsoon climate can be seen in the Eastern Ghats. Both the South-West and the North-East retreating monsoons bring rain to the area.\nIn the Northern Ghats, the mean annual rainfall distribution exceeds 1500 mm. In and surrounding the Nallamalai highlands, it progressively drops to 1000 mm. Along the East Coast\u2019s Coastal plain, rainfall also tops 1000 mm.\nProtected Areas in the mountains region\nSome major protected areas are Simlipal, Coringa, Satyamangalam, Sri Lankamalleswara wildlife sanctuaries and Satkosia Tiger reserve.\nThe important ecoregions consist of Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests, East Deccan dry evergreen forests, Deccan thorn scrub forests, Shrub lands and South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests.\nBiological diversity in the Eastern Ghats\nAlong its length on India\u2019s East Coast, from south to north, this region comprises various ecoregions.\nAlthough the Eastern Ghats\u2019 biospheres are not as well known as the Western Ghats, they are still significant because of their abundant forests, perennial and semi-perennial streams, and other natural resources.\nThe forests include tropical dry scrub forests, dry savannah forests, semi-evergreen forests, and dry evergreen forests, among others.\nHere you may find valuable trees including Eetti, Mahagony, Semmaram, Vengai, Pala, and Rosewood.\n2,500 flowering plants live in the range, protecting 13% of all flowering plants in India. Additionally, they serve as the homes for various bird, reptile, and insect species.\nBiodiversity Crisis of Eastern Ghats\nIntensive agriculture:\u00a0 In these hills, large-scale monocultures of rice, coffee, tea, and orchards are being grown, which is weakening the delicate ecosystem and removing natural plants.\nCommercial activities:\u00a0 The natural topography of the Eastern Ghats is being dangerously impacted by large-scale mineral exploration for bauxite and iron ores, their transportation, and the transmission of power lines. For instance: Forests have been indiscriminately destroyed as a result of the massive quantities of bauxite and magnesite ore that have been removed from the Kolli Hills and Servarayan Hills.\nOver-exploitation:\u00a0 The over-exploitation of forests by plant-based industries, such as plywood, paper, and pulp-making facilities, illegal firewood collection, illegal grazing, and illegal tree cutting, is also contributing to their degradation. Denudation of hilltops is occurring on a large scale as a result of the Chenchu tribes\u2019 nomadic lifestyle in search of arable land.\nLogging:\u00a0 Trees like the fragrant and priceless sandal and rosewood have been indiscriminately cut down and illegally removed by taking advantage of gaps in conservation laws and other government regulations.\nInvasive species:\u00a0 The number of species in the Eastern Ghats has decreased as a result of the invasion of alien species like Lantana Camara, which compete with native plants for nutrients and space.\nForest fires:\u00a0 The ghats\u2019 deciduous woodlands are particularly prone to forest fires. Large fires are destroying the landscape more frequently due to rare precipitation. Fire-cleared areas are further eroded by wind or become overrun by alien species.\nClimate change:\u00a0 By increasing the average annual temperature and the microclimate of flora to levels unfavorable for their physiological activity, delayed and infrequent monsoons and frequent forest fires have reduced the quality of biodiversity.\nRelated Posts\nWestern Ghats: Explained\nGadgil Report and Kasturirangan Report on Western Ghats\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

Through the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976 Forests and Protection of Wild Animals and Birds was transferred from State to Concurrent List.\n\nArticle 48 A in the Directive Principles of State policy, mandates that the State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country.\n\nArticle 51 A (g) of the Constitution states that it shall be the fundamental duty of every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment including forests and Wildlife.\u00a0\n\nStatutes relating to the forest\n\nIndia\u2019s forests are currently governed by the National Forest Policy, 1988 which has environmental balance and livelihood at its centre.\n\nClassification of forest types\n\nA great variety of forests are found in different parts of India due to unequal distribution of rainfall and temperature as well as their seasonal variation, besides varied biotic conditions.\u00a0\n\nForests have a great relationship with the surrounding atmosphere. The range of forests in India is very diverse.\n\nWe can find here from the rain forest of Kerala in the South to the alpine pastures of Ladakh, from the desert of Rajasthan in the west to the evergreen forest in the North East.\n\nAccordingly, the forests in India can be divided as\n\n1.

    "[CONTENT] #297": "The word tsunami comes from the Japanese words \u201ctsu\u201d for harbour and \u201cnami\u201d for wave.\n\nBased on the High-Powered Committee on Disaster Management\u2019s report (2001), the term \u201ctsunami\u201d refers to an ocean wave that is caused by an ocean event, such as an earthquake, landslide, or volcanic eruption.\n\nA tsunami is not just one wave; rather, it is a sequence of waves brought on by geological processes occurring near or below the ocean\u2019s surface.\n\nThese waves have the potential to grow to tremendous sizes.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFormation of Tsunamis\nUndersea Earthquakes\nLandslides\nVolcanic Eruptions\nMeteorites and Asteroids\nPropagation of the Tsunamis\nEffects of Tsunamis\nTsunami in the Indian Ocean\nDamages Caused by Tsunami\nTsunami Disaster Management and Mitigation\nAdvance Warning about Tsunamis\nTsunami Warning System in India\nWhy the Problem is Consistent\nFormation of Tsunamis\n\nSeveral factors and incidents can lead to the formation of tsunamis, a few important of them are-\n\nUndersea Earthquakes\n\nAlthough landslides, volcanic eruptions, or even the impact of a sizable meteorite striking the water can all result in tsunamis, the most catastrophic tsunamis are produced by massive undersea earthquakes.\n\nThese destructive tsunami waves are produced by the vertical movement of the entire water column, and such a situation may arise as a result of sudden, jerky motions of fault blocks on the seabed.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt should be emphasised that horizontal displacement of the sea floor usually does not cause a tsunami.\n\nIn addition, not all undersea earthquakes create tsunamis, as it depends upon the nature and degree of displacement of the seawater columns.\n\nLandslides\n\nOther natural disasters like rock fall, landslides, and icefalls can cause the displacement of seawater which can lead to tsunami waves. These waves rapidly travel away from the source due to the dissipation of energy and create havoc in the nearby coastlines.\n\nVolcanic Eruptions\n\nWhen a powerful underwater volcanic eruption occurs, a significant amount of seawater is abruptly displaced, which results in the formation of tsunami waves.\n\nMeteorites and Asteroids\n\nIn the event that meteorites and asteroids fall into the water, there is a chance that a tsunami could emerge.\n\nDespite the extreme rarity of such an impact, the researcher gives\u00a0the destructive potential of a tsunami brought on by a near-Earth asteroid.\n\nPropagation of the Tsunamis\n\nTsunamis are made up of a series of extremely long waves that travel away from their point of origin on the ocean\u2019s surface in all directions.\n\nThe tsunamis cannot be seen or heard because of their extremely long wavelength and very low amplitude in deep water. Therefore, as the killer waves pass by underneath boats at fast speeds, passengers cannot feel or see the tsunami waves.\n\nAs the tsunamis leave the deep water of the open ocean and travel towards the shallow water, they are transformed in two ways.\u00a0 They first experience a significant reduction in speed, then a massive increase in height.\n\nEffects of Tsunamis\n\nResidents of coastal areas are in serious danger from tsunamis. They emerge out of nowhere and strike the seashore like a water bomb with enormous, powerful waves that are travelling with great speed.\n\nLoaded with enormous energy, the killer waves create havoc by flooding hundreds of metres inland, past the typical high water level.\n\nTsunami in the Indian Ocean\n\nMultiple times, tsunamis have been caused in the Indian Ocean. On Indonesia\u2019s Java and Sumatra islands in 1883, tsunamis generated by Krakatoa eruptions killed 36,000 people.\n\nDamages Caused by Tsunami\n\nVarious types of damages caused by the tsunami are briefly described below.\n\nDeath Toll\n\nTsunamis always claim lakhs of lives.\n\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India were the most vulnerable because they were situated closest to the earthquake\u2019s epicentre and the source of the tsunamis.\n\nThe coastal regions of Tamil Nadu were the primary targets of the tsunami attack on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIndonesia and Sri Lanka were the nations that recorded death tolls that were higher than those in India.\n\nLoss of Property\n\nAs a result of tsunami attacks, property worth millions of rupees gets\u00a0damaged. Houses, public buildings, transportation systems, and other infrastructure components\u00a0suffer\u00a0damage that is\u00a0practically irreparable.\n\nIn the tsunami of 26th December 2004, the coastal regions of India, which include sizable coastal tracts in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Pondicherry, and Kerala, have incurred billions of rupees worth of financial losses, according to preliminary findings of the Indian government.\n\nPhysiographical Changes\n\nAccording to reports, the tsunami on December 26, 2004, many islands\u2019 water levels has risen, causing a number of their beaches to split in two. Indira Point, the southernmost point of the Indian Union, was nearly entirely washed out, reducing the coastline inward.\n\nThe Motion of the Earth\n\nAccording to a US Geological Survey, the earthquake\u2019s enormous energy release caused the earth to tilt slightly. According to NASA\u2019s geophysicist Richard Gross, the earthquake may have permanently accelerated the rotation of the planet due to a shift of mass toward its centre.\n\nA Decline in Soil Fertility and Agricultural Production\n\nVast, low-lying coastal areas were submerged by water, which made the soil more saline and decreases\u00a0agricultural production. The soil\u2019s extreme salinity renders\u00a0the field unproductive.\n\nEffect on Marine Life\n\nThe marine life of the Ocean gets severely impacted by deadly tsunamis.\n\nThe coral reefs of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands archipelago were severely damaged or destroyed as a result of the tsunamis that occurred in 2004. It was possible that some of the archipelagic species might get extinct.\n\nThe destructive tsunamis caused severe losses in the fishing industry as well.\n\nLarge marine mammals including whales, dolphins, and other species were negatively impacted in their breeding, feeding, and other activities.\n\nTsunami Disaster Management and Mitigation\n\nOceanic waves known as tsunamis are so strong that it is impossible for humans to contain or control them. However, in the event that tsunamis are approaching, the following advice can be useful.\n\nGet off the beaches and head for higher ground.\nStay away from rivers leading into the ocean.\nWait for all clear as there can be several giant waves in succession.\nAdvance Warning about Tsunamis\n\nThe most effective strategy to protect vulnerable communities from the wrath of deadly tsunami waves is to provide them with advance notice of impending tsunamis. The common individual will benefit from the following advice in understanding the threat posed by tsunamis.\n\nIt is possible to predict the onslaught of tsunamis by studying their speed, wavelength and depth of the sea.\u00a0 Tsunamis often take some time to reach the seashore from their point of origin because, as they get closer to the shallow sea, their wavelength and speed are drastically reduced.\n\nHowever, when they get to the shallow coastal seas, their energy is compressed, and they turn into deadly waves that destroy the coastal inhabitants.\n\nTherefore, a timely warning of tsunamis a few hours in advance can prevent the loss of thousands of lives and millions of rupees worth of property.\n\nTsunami Warning System in India\n\nUnfortunately, India and other Indian Ocean-rim countries did not have tsunami warning systems in 2004 when the deadly tsunamis hit the coasts of the Indian Ocean.\n\nAfter the catastrophe, India decided to install its own tsunami warning system rather than becoming a part of the Pacific Warning System.\n\nThe system comprises a real-time network of seismic stations, bottom pressure recorders (BPR) and tide gauges to monitor earthquakes in the sea and tsunamis triggered by them.\n\nWhy the Problem is Consistent\n\nAlthough tsunamis constitute a natural tragedy and man has hardly any control over such a powerful natural phenomenon yet man\u2019s own misdeeds have made the situation very dangerous and helped in aggravating the fury of tsunamis.\n\nFor instance, no building is permitted within\u00a0500 metres of\u00a0the coast. In India, it is required by law to keep this area of land undeveloped, yet many development projects (residential, commercial, recreational, etc.) are still carried out without regard for the law. The population in this region is most susceptible to tsunamis and other maritime dangers.\n\nMining sand and other minerals from the sea makes the concerned area highly vulnerable to tsunamis. The sand deposited on the sea coast absorbs much energy from the waves and saves much of the coastal areas from their fury. There is an urgent need to check unwanted construction and mining in ecologically sensitive coastal areas.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

On 28 March, at least 369 ships were queuing to pass through the canal. This prevented an estimated US$9.6 billion worth of trade. This shows the importance of straits and canals in world trade.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are straits?\nHow straits are formed?\nWhat is the significance of straits?\nDifferences between Gulf and Strait\nSome of the major straits in the world\n1. Strait of Hormuz:\n2. Strait of Malacca:\n3. Bab al-Mandab:\n4. Palk Strait:\n5. Sunda Strait:\n6. Mozambique Channel:\n7. Gibraltar Strait:\n8. Bosphorus strait and Dardanelles strait:\nConclusion\nWhat are straits?\n\nStrait is a naturally formed, narrow, typically navigable waterway that connects two larger bodies of water. Most commonly it is a channel of water that lies between two landmasses. Some straits are not navigable, for example, because they are too shallow, or because of an unnavigable reef or archipelago.\n\nHow straits are formed?\n\nIt is possible that the narrow-shaped isthmus fracture will result in straits. It connects different water bodies. According to legend, straits occur as a result of plate tectonic activity. For instance, the tectonic activity in Africa is what created the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\nIt is a breakdown of the Gibraltar Isthmus. However, human activity also creates straits which are named canals. It is used for directing water flow for domestic and commercial consumption. One such strait is Suez Canal, built-in 1869.\n\nBetween the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, it serves as a watershed. Originally constructed for commerce, it today serves as a waterway connecting Europe and Asia. Without a watershed, one would have to travel into Africa to convey goods, which lengthens the journey time. Therefore, certain straits are constructed to stimulate commercial activity.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nStraits can also created when water bodies flood. Straits are also formed as a result of erosion and landslides. The Bosporus connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea. Bosporus was created as a result of weathering and erosion occurring naturally. As the only physical boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia, the Bosporus is crucial for geologists.\n\nAlso read: Marginal seas of the world\n\nWhat is the significance of straits?\nStraits play an important role in the Seaborne trade for commercial shipping.\nThey play an important role in geopolitics.\nStraits have played an essential role in human civilization for millennia.\nThey play an important role in economic and military matters.\nMajor straits of the world are used for commercial shipping to travel from one exclusive zone or sea to another.\nStraits are immensely commercially and strategically important. Straits provide various navigable routes to many ships. For instance, the strait of Hormuz plays an important role as the world\u2019s one-third of oil trade takes place through this strait.\nStraits are also used in generating tidal power with the help of turbines. For example, 5.6 GW of energy is produced by Cook\u2019s strait of New Zealand.\nThe Strait plays a vital role in serving as a channel through which ocean currents are passed which helps in mortifying the climate of that area. That is why straits are playing an essential role both in physical and human geography.\nDifferences between Gulf and Strait\n\nGulfs and Straits have been considered geographical features on the earth\u2019s surface. Both gulfs and straits are part of the water body.\n\nGulf refers to an inlet within the sea which is deep and has a narrow opening. Gulf refers to the portion of the ocean which penetrates within the land. It can be different in shape, deepness and size.\n\nStraits refer to a narrow waterway that acts as a connector toward a large water body. The connector is a link between two watersheds; hence, it is formed due to a fracture of the isthmus. Straits are generally formed due to tectonic shifts.\n\nThe gulf and Straits are both man-made and natural; they are used for economic purposes. The Gulf of Mexico and Oman has been used as economic sites for transport and trading. The Gulf of Mexico is the largest gulf used for recreational activities, commercial, and sports. Suez Canal is the largest man-made strait used for trading and transportation purposes.\n\nGulf\n\t\nStrait\u00a0\n\n\nThe gulf is a sea portion that penetrates within the land.\n\t\nStraits are narrow watersheds that act as a connector between two huge water bodies.\n\n\nIt connects both land and sea.\n\t\nIt is a connector of water bodies only.\n\n\nThe gulf is usually formed naturally.\n\t\nIt is majorly man-made, like canals.\n\n\nThe gulf is very helpful for harbouring ships.\n\t\nThey are very small and cannot be used for harbouring purposes.\n\n\nSometimes, it is also considered a large bay.\n\t\nThey are very narrow and are used as canals.\n\n\neg: Gulf of Mannar, Persian gulf\n\t\neg: Hormuz straits, Malacca strait\nSome of the major straits in the world\n1. Strait of Hormuz:\nIt links the Persian Gulf (West) with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea (southeast).\nIt contains the Islands of Qeshm, Hormuz and Hengam.\nIt is of crucial strategic and economic significance, particularly given that oil tankers bringing in cargo from several Persian Gulf ports must cross the strait.\nOPEC members Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, Kuwait and Iraq export most of the crude via the strait.\nQatar, the world\u2019s biggest LNG exporter, sends almost all of its LNG through the strait.\n2. Strait of Malacca:\nIt connects the Andaman Sea (Indian Ocean) and the South China Sea (Pacific Ocean)\nIt is the longest strait in the world, measuring roughly 800 kilometres, and it not only makes it easier for locals to travel about, but it also serves as a hub for trade, culture, ideas, and information between East and West.\nThe Strait of Malacca connects the Indian Ocean with the South China Maritime, making it the shortest sea route between China and India and one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.\nThe importance of this region has grown as a result of the worldwide shift in economic power from the West to the East as well as booming commerce, investments, and production in areas spanning the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins.\n3. Bab al-Mandab:\nThe strait known as Bab al-Mandab is what divides the Arabian Peninsula from the Horn of Africa.\nIt connects the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden.\nThe strait, which is bordered by Yemen on one side and Djibouti and Eritrea on the other, is barely 29 km wide at its narrowest point.\nIt is a crucial strategic route for trade and commerce, with an estimated 4% of the world\u2019s oil supply travelling through it.\n4. Palk Strait:\nIt links Palk Bay in the southwest with the Bay of Bengal in the northeast.\nThe strait is less than 330 feet (100 metres) deep, 40 to 85 miles (64 to 137 km) long, and 64 to 137 km broad.\nOn the Sri Lankan side, it has several islands and receives various rivers, notably the Vaigai (India).\nThe Adam\u2019s Bridge is a collection of sand shoals formed over time by sedimentation.\nA calcareous foundation of dead reef and sand supports every island.\nPart of the Gulf of Mannar between Rameswaram and Tuticorin, which includes 21 islands and the nearby shallow coastal waters, was designated as a Marine National Park in 1986 due to its great biodiversity of over 4,000 species of varied flora and wildlife.\n5. Sunda Strait:\nIt connects the Indian Ocean to the Java Sea in the Pacific Ocean (south).\nBetween the east Java and Sumatra islands is the Sunda Strait, or Selat Sunda in Indonesian. Its width ranges from 16 to 70 miles (26 to 110 kilometres).\nAn essential route linking eastern Asia and the Indian Ocean is the Sunda Strait.\nThis shallowness, very powerful tidal currents, sandbanks, and man-made obstacles like oil rigs off the Java coast make it infamously challenging to navigate.\nMany big, contemporary ships utilise the Strait of Malacca instead of the strait due to its narrowness, shallowness, and lack of good mapping.\n6. Mozambique Channel:\nIt is situated between the eastern island country of Madagascar and Mozambique on the continent of Africa (west).\nThe northern entrance is marked by the Comoro Archipelago, and the southern entry is marked by the islands of Bassas da India and Europa.\nIt receives all main Madagascar rivers and has the ports of Mahajanga (Majunga) and Toliary (Tul\u00e9ar) on the same coast, making it a crucial route for commerce in eastern Africa.\nThe mouth of the Zambezi River and the ports of Maputo (formerly Louren\u00e7o Marques), Mo\u00e7ambique, and Beira are located on the opposite shore.\nThe strait is traversed by the Mozambique Current.\n7. Gibraltar Strait:\nIt is a waterway that runs between the southernmost point of Spain and the westernmost point of Africa, bridging the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\nBetween Point Marroqu (Spain) and Point Cires, it is 36 miles (58 km) long and narrows to 8 miles (13 km) in width (Morocco).\nBecause it allows for seaborne transit for commerce between the Atlantic and Mediterranean, as well as via the Suez Canal into the Indian Ocean and beyond, it is one of the most important worldwide sea lanes.\nThe Strait is the busiest shipping waterway in the world after the English Channel.\n8. Bosphorus strait and Dardanelles strait:\nThe Bosphorus sometimes referred to as the Strait of Istanbul, is a narrow, naturally occurring waterway that connects northwest Turkey to the rest of the world.\nThe Bosporus links the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara and, indirectly, to the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas via the Dardanelles.\nIt is the narrowest strait in the world that is used for international shipping.\nThe Dardanelles, a strait that separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey, is a narrow, naturally occurring, and globally significant waterway that is located in northwest Turkey.\nThe Sea of Marmara is linked to the Aegean, Mediterranean, and, indirectly through the Bosphorus, the Black Sea by the Dardanelles.\nConclusion\n\nImportant geological features created by biological processes include the gulf and straits. However, the differences may be distinguished by their size, shape, and depth in addition to other characteristics. The gulf is a sea portion that penetrates with the landmass while straits are surrounded by ocean on all sides. The Gulf has a narrow opening while the entire shape and size of the strait is narrow. Both are used for trade and commercial purposes\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

On average India receives 118 cm of annual rainfall which is considered to be the highest anywhere in the world for a country of comparable size.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHowever, the southwest monsoons\u2019 unpredictable, unreliable, and variable rainfall causes drought conditions in many parts of the country. The major causes of meteorological drought are:\n\nDue to the lack of depressions over India, there have been weak monsoons and below-average rainfall.\nEarly monsoon withdrawal or late monsoon onset\nprolonged breaks in monsoon.\nRe-establishment of the southern branch of the jet stream.\nHydrological Drought\n\nHydrological drought is associated with a reduction in water. A meteorological drought often leads to a hydrological drought. In most cases, it takes two consecutive meteorological droughts before a hydrological drought manifests itself. There are two types of hydrological droughts viz.,\n\nSurface water drought\nGroundwater drought.\n\nSurface-water Drought\n\nIt is concerned with the drying up of surface water resources such as rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, tanks, reservoirs, etc.\n\nThere are many processes, besides meteorological drought, which lead to surface water drought. Surface water drought is primarily caused by extensive deforestation. Other undesirable human activities that enhance the drought condition are the expansion of non-terraced agriculture, environmentally hazardous mining, and indiscriminate road construction.\n\nGroundwater Drought\n\nGroundwater drought is associated with a reduction in the groundwater level. This phenomenon happens due to excessive groundwater pumping without compensatory replenishment and creating more or less irreversible groundwater drought even during normal rainfall conditions.\n\nThere are soft, permeable alluvial soils in India\u2019s northern plain. These soils allow water to penetrate and aid in replenishing groundwater. The peninsular plateau, in contrast, contains hard, impervious rocks that obstruct the replenishment of groundwater. Still, a situation of reduction in groundwater level pertains to the Northern Indian Plain too.\n\nAgricultural Drought\n\nAgricultural drought is concerned with the impact of meteorological/hydrological drought on crop yields. Agricultural drought results when soil moisture and rainfall levels are insufficient to support a healthy crop\u2019s growth to maturity, leading to high moisture stress and the withering of important crop areas.\n\nHigh-yielding varieties (HYV) of seeds have taken the place of conventional drought-resistant seeds since the beginning of the green revolution in India in the 1960s. The water needs of various crops have increased as a result of the use of fertilizers.\n\nThe Green Revolution-based agriculture is incredibly reliant on irrigation, and any delay in the water supply will result in severe agricultural drought.\n\nMoreover, the Green Revolution brought changes in cropping patterns.\n\nFor example, rice cultivation was practically unknown in Punjab, Haryana, and Western Uttar Pradesh before Green Revolution and this region is not suitable for rice cultivation considering the amount of rainfall received by this region.\n\nDue to the changing cropping patterns, limited water supplies are under severe stress, which occasionally results in severe droughts.\n\nSoil Moisture Drought\n\nThis is a concern with insufficient soil moisture, especially in locations that receive rain, which may not sustain agricultural growth. This occurs during a meteorological drought when there is less water available to the soil and more water is lost through evaporation.\n\nSocio-Economic Drought\n\nIt reflects the reduction of availability of food and loss of income because of crop failures that endanger the food and social security of individuals in the affected areas.\n\nFamine\n\nA famine happens when access to food is reduced significantly, which\u00a0could result in widespread starvation if assistance is not provided.\n\nEcological Drought\n\nEcological drought occurs when environmental harm caused by distress causes a natural eco-productivity system to decrease significantly.\n\nCauses\nIndia experiences droughts when the southwest monsoon is weak. Droughts occur as a result of a weak monsoon\u2019s inadequate rainfall.\nDroughts can also be brought on by the monsoons\u2019 late arrival\u00a0or early departure.\nDroughts are another consequence of prolonged monsoon breaks during the rainy season.\n\nAlthough a drought may occur at any time and in any part of the country, most of the drought-prone areas are those having marginal rainfall and high variability of rainfall.\n\nEffects\n\nDroughts have a wide range of effects on the masses, especially in developing countries like India. The following categories best describe the impact of droughts in India:\n\nPhysical Impact: adverse effect of drought on the recharge of soil moisture, surface runoff, and groundwater table.\nImpact on Agriculture:\u00a0Indian agriculture is largely dependent on monsoon rainfall. Approx two-thirds of the arable land is rainfed and lacks irrigation facilities. The effect results in the shortfalls of agricultural production in drought years.\nSocial and Economic Impact:\u00a0A drought can have more severe social and economic effects than it does physically or agriculturally. Drought is associated with famine which has its own social and economic consequences.\n\nThe effects of drought appear can cause severe damage, a few important them are mentioned below:\n\nResults in decline in cultivated area and fall in agricultural production.\nFall in purchasing power.\nFall in employment in the agricultural sector.\nCan create a scarcity of drinking water, fodder, and food.\nCauses Inflation\nLivestock deaths and distressed sales of cattle.\nWidespread malnutrition.\nSpread of diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and ophthalmia caused by malnutrition, hunger, and starvation.\nSale and mortgage of property, jewelry, etc. in distress.\nMigration of people from drought-hit areas to other areas for livelihood.\nDeath due to malnutrition/starvation/diseases.\nHarsh impact on secondary and tertiary activities due to falling of primary production.\nSocial stress and tension, disruption of social institutions, and an increase in social crime.\n\nThe weaker segments of society\u00a0are most affected by a drought. These people include migrant workers, small-scale and marginal farmers, and artists like weavers.\n\nDrought Prone Areas\n\nA drought-prone area is defined as one in which the probability of a drought year is greater than 20%.\n\nA chronic drought-prone area is one in which the probability of a drought year is greater than 40%.\n\nA drought year occurs when less than 75% of the normal rainfall is received.\n\nIn India, 16 percent of the total area and 12 percent of the population is drought-affected, although the total average drought-prone area may be as much as 10 lakh sq km or about one-third of the total land area of the country.\n\nAlso read: Cloud Seeding\n\nFrequency\n\nThe number of times a drought occurs over a specific period is referred to as its frequency. Depending on the amount, fluctuation, and need for water, different regions of the country experience different frequencies of droughts.\n\nThe first systematic attempt at famine relief measures could be traced to the Great Famine or the Orissa Famine of 1866. Under Sir George Campbell\u2019s chairmanship, the then\u00a0government formed\u00a0the first Famine Commission.\n\nThe formation of a Famine Commission in 1880 in the wake of the famines of 1873 and 1876\u20131878 was the second step. As a result of the Famine Commission\u2019s suggestions, the government chose to introduce the Famine Codes started\u00a0in 1883, bringing in the modern approach to relief administration.\n\nRead:\u00a0Famines in Colonial India\n\nMoving from Drought Relief to Drought Management\n\nAfter Independence, India experienced major droughts in the years 1965-67, 1972-73, 1979 80 and 1985-88.\n\nThe High-Powered Committee on Disaster Management\u2019s report 2002 states that \u201cdrought management is often done by focusing on water conservation and supply, standing crop saving, and public distribution supplies of essential commodities.\u201d\n\nDrought Prone Area Programmes (DPAP)\n\nThis programme was initiated in 1974. The intention was to change DPAP from a relief and employment-oriented programme into one aimed at \u2018drought-proofing\u2019 through the adoption of an integrated area development approach which sought to mitigate the impact of future droughts by stabilizing both production and employment.\n\nThe objectives of the programme are:\n\nTo minimize the adverse effects of drought on the production of crops and livestock and productivity of land, water, and human resources through integrated development of the natural resource base of the area and adoption of appropriate technologies.\nto long-term preservation, development, and utilization of land, water, and other natural resources, especially rainfall.\nIntegrated Watershed Management\n\nThe prevention of drought conditions is greatly aided by integrated watershed management.\n\nThis strategy guarantees coordinated planning, combined use of surface and groundwater, prioritization of rational water use, and planning based on the entire amount of available water resources.\n\nVarious watersheds have been constructed throughout the country\u2019s different rainfed regions as part of the National Watershed Programme for Rainfed Areas.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Scheduled Tribes in the country (excluding Jammu and Kashmir), make up 8.08 per cent of the overall population. India\u2019s tribal population increased to 10.43 Cr. from 8.43 Cr. in 2001\n\nAs per the 2011 census, 10.42 crore Indians are notified as \u2018Scheduled Tribes\u2019 (ST), which constitute 8.6% of countries total population.\n\nThe growth of the Scheduled Tribes population was due to the following two reasons:\n\nThere has been a rapid natural growth of tribal population, and\nThe list of Scheduled Tribes has frequently been expanded.\nWhy Demographic Study of Tribal Population is Difficult?\n\nThe use of arbitrary criteria for \u201cscheduling the tribes\u201d has severely harmed the demographic study of tribal populations.\n\nDue to a lack of precise and scientific standards, the research of indigenous people suffers from major abnormalities.\n\nFor instance, in Madhya Pradesh, the Gonds are a Scheduled Tribe, whereas, in Uttar Pradesh, they are a Scheduled Caste.\n\nDistribution of Scheduled Tribes\n\nThe distribution pattern is characterised by a striking tendency of clustering and concentrating in pockets, making them suffer from isolation and situated in areas where the environmental setting is, by and large, not suitable for settled agriculture.\n\nAs a result, the majority of tribal settlements are found in remote regions of the nation that are covered with\u00a0hills and forests. The tribal groups have created their own distinct traditional way of life. After Independence, however, there was some interaction between tribal and non-tribal people that altered the situation substantially.\n\nThe distribution of Scheduled Tribes is markedly different from that of Scheduled Castes.\u00a0 Scheduled Castes\u00a0exhibit a very high concentration in the fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain and the Coastal Plains, where they work as agricultural labourers. Scheduled Tribes, on the other hand, tend to concentrate in remote and less hospitable regions.\n\nState Level Patterns\n\nThere are wide variations in the state-level distribution of the tribal populations.\n\nWhile, on one hand, no tribes have been scheduled in Punjab and Haryana, and the union territories of Delhi, Chandigarh and Puducherry; as much as 94.43 per cent of the total population in Mizoram and 94.79 per cent in Lakshadweep belongs to Scheduled Tribes.\n\nAmong the 15 major states, Chhattisgarh has the largest proportion of the Scheduled Tribe population at 30.62 per cent followed by Jharkhand at 26.21 per cent.\n\nFurther, 71% of\u00a0India\u2019s Scheduled Tribes population\u00a0is also mostly concentrated in six states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Jharkhand.\n\nTribal Economy\n\nFor the Indian classification of Scheduled Tribes, tribal economy plays a significant role. The following are the tribes\u2019 primary economies:\n\nHunting, fishing and food gathering,\nShifting cultivation and lumbering, and\nSedentary cultivation and animal husbandry.\n\nA brief account of tribes practising these economies is given as under:\n\nHunting, Fishing and Gathering\n\nA huge number of tribes rely on hunting, fishing, and food collecting and live in isolation in forests. Some of the tribes only engage exclusively in these activities.\n\nA list of a few main tribes engaged in such activities from different states is given-\n\nRaji in Uttar Pradesh;\nKharia, Birhor, Korwa, Pariha and Birgias in Jharkhand;\nKuki in West Bengal;\nHill-Maria in Chhattisgarh,\nJuang in Odisha,\nChenchu and Yanadi in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana,\nKoya, Reddi, Kadar and Paliyan in Tamil Nadu,\nBhil, Garasia in Maharashtra and Gujarat;\nBhil, Garasia and Sahariya in Rajasthan\nKuki, Konyak and Naga in Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nShifting Cultivation and Lumbering\n\nShifting cultivation is said to be as old as the history of agriculture itself.\n\nIn this kind of farming, an area of forestland is cleared using the slash-and-burn method so that crops can be produced there.\n\nAfter two to three years, the soil\u2019s fertility declines, and the farmer moves to another plot of land. It is termed shifting agriculture. Different regions of the country have different names for them. It is referred to as Jhum or jum.\n\nThe main tribes practising shifting cultivation and lumbering are-\n\nKoria, Saharia, Bhutias and Kharwar in Uttar Pradesh,\nKorwa and Asur in Jharkhand;\nGaro, Mal-Paharia in West Bengal;\nGonda, Baiga, Maria, and Dhora in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh;\nSaora, Khond, Kurumba and Bagola in Andhra Pradesh:\nSaora, Keria and Khond in Odisha;\nKhond, Gond, Kurumba and Muduwan in Tamil Nadu;\nGharasia and Bhil in Maharashtra and Gujarat;\n\nSedentary Cultivation and Animal Husbandry\n\nSedentary farming is a style of agriculture where the farmer grows food primarily for his personal needs, with a little left over to sell on the market.\n\nThis is hardly an advanced form of cultivation, and indigenous people typically practise it together with animal husbandry.\n\nThe primary tribes that have adopted these occupations include-\n\nTharu, Khasa, Bhoksa, Maghi, Kol and Bhotias in Uttar Pradesh;\nMunda, Ho, Korwa, Oraon, Tamaria, and Santhal in Jharkhand;\nPolia, Santhal, and Bhumji in West Bengal;\nParja, Bhatra, Baija and Gond in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh,\nBadaga, Irula, Parga and Malydi in Tamil Nadu,\nBadaga, Koya, Irula and Kota in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana;\nBhil, Dubla, Raiwari, Barali, Koli, Dhamalia, etc. in Maharashtra and Gujarat,\nBhil, Garasiya and Meena in Rajasthan.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

To answer these questions, read further.\n\nThe Himalayan Mountains are part of India\u2019s northern mountain range. They are the world\u2019s tallest mountain ranges. These mountain ranges begin at Pamir Knot in the west and continue to Purvanchal in the east.\n\nThe Himalayas are the result of the Indian and Eurasian plates colliding. Indian Peninsula split off from Gondwana during the Cretaceous Period and began moving north. Between the two plates, the Tethys was squeezed, creating a geosyncline.\n\nThe Indian Plate\u2019s oceanic boundary was subducted\u00a0as the plate moved north, leaving some of these rocks in the Ladakh region.\n\nThe northward drift along with the Tethys sea compression caused the Himalayas to rise. The mountains continued to converge, creating fold mountains known as the Main Himalayas or Greater Himalayas, and south of them, the Main Central Thrust.\n\nEastern Himalayas were generated by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates 60 million years ago, which caused the construction of the Potwar plateau and an anticlockwise spin in the plate.\n\nAs the process continued, the Main Boundary Fault line developed south of the Lesser Himalayas. It is\u00a0referred to as the Middle Himalayas.\n\nForedeep was formed on the foothills of the Greater and Lesser Himalayas, where deposition and subsequent compression resulted in the construction of the Shivalik Mountains and a new fault line emerged which came to be known as the Himalayan frontal line.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFrom the Indus gorge in the west to the Brahmaputra gorge in the east, the Himalayas stretch in an east-west pattern.\n\nAt these gorges, the Himalayan ranges make abrupt bends to the south. These bends are known as the Himalayan syntaxial bends.\n\nThe western syntaxial bend is located close to Nanga Parbat, where the Indus river has built a large gorge. The Namche Barwa is close to the eastern syntaxial bend.\n\nThe Himalayas is one of the three mountain ranges that constitute the Himalayan mountain range system. These were created by the tectonic collision of the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The Purvanchal Hills, Trans Himalayas, and Himalayas are the three Himalayan mountain ranges that constitute up the northern mountain chain.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Great Himalayas\nTrans Himalayas\nLesser Himalayas\nShivalik\nPurvanchal or Eastern Himalayas\nSignificance\nThe Great Himalayas\n\nIt is also known as Himadri, the Central Himalayas, or the Inner Himalayas. The hogback topography\u2014a long, steep hill or mountain ridge\u2014is created by the asymmetrical folds in this range, which have a high south slope and a mild north slope.\n\nIts typical height is 5000 kilometers. It has tall mountains and vast glacier snowfields and is mostly made up of crystal-rich igneous or metamorphic rocks.\n\nIts core is comprised of Archean rocks, and there are very few gaps and antecedent rivers. The range is also continuous. It forms an arc from Nanga Parbat in the west to Namcha Barwa in the east.\n\nFew of the current passes are Zojila and Brazil in Kashmir, Bara Lapcha La and Shipki La in Himachal Pradesh, Niti pass and Lipu lekh in Uttarakhand, and Nathula and Jelep La in Si.\n\nTrans Himalayas\n\nThe Trans himalaya is a 1,600-kilometer (990 mi) long mountain range that runs parallel to the main Himalayan range in a west-to-east orientation. It is on the southern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, north of the Yarlung Tsangpo river.\n\nThe Trans-Himalayas is mostly made up of granite and volcanic materials. The mountains lack a clear alignment and are not split by large river gorges like the main Himalayas.\n\nThe Great Karakoram Range, also known as the Krishnagiri Range, is the northernmost range of the Trans-Himalayan Ranges in India.\n\nThe Karakoram Range stretches around 800 kilometers east of the Pamir. It is a mountain range with high peaks (elevations of 5,500 m or more). Some of the largest glaciers in the world outside of the polar regions call this place home.\n\nThe second-highest peak in the globe and the highest mountain in the Indian Union is K2.\n\nThe Ladakh Plateau is located to the northeast of the Karakoram Range. It is divided into several plains and mountains.\n\nLesser Himalayas\n\nThe Greater Himalayas in the north and the Shiwaliks in the south have a nearly parallel alignment with both ranges.\n\nIts typical height ranges from 1300 to 5000 kilometers. Typically, it is made up of crystalline sediments.\n\nWhile the arrangement is considerably distinct and reflects very heavily folded and complex structures, its lithology is identical to the Main Himalayas.\n\nDhauladhar, Pirpanjal, Nagatibba, Mussorie, and Mahabharat ranges are significant ranges. While northern slopes are rocky, southern slopes are steep. Small pastures known as Merg can be found on slopes.\n\nThe Mussoorie and Nag Tibba ranges in Uttarakhand serve as landmarks for the Middle Himalayas.\n\nHuman contact is easier in the Middle Himalayan ranges.\n\nThe lower Himalayas are represented by the Sapt Kosi, Sikkim, Bhutan, Miri, Abor, and Mishmi hills east of the Kosi River. The Mahabharat Lekh, in southern Nepal, is a continuation of the Mussoorie Range.\n\nThis region is the location of the majority of Himalayan hill resorts, including Shimla, Mussoorie, Ranikhet, Nainital, Almora, and Darjeeling, among others.\n\nShivalik\n\nThis range, which is not continuous, is also known as the outer Himalayas. It looks like a hogback and its slopes are more steep in the south.\n\nThere are valleys in the north called Doon in the west and Duar in the east. They go by the name Dehradun.\n\nMostly fossiliferous sedimentary rocks, such as sandstone, sand rocks, clay, conglomerate, and limestone, constitute this zone.\n\nThick trees cover the Shiwalik range from North-East India to Nepal, but as you move west from Nepal, the amount of forest cover reduces. The quantum of rainfall decreases from east to west in Shiwaliks and Ganga Plains.\n\nNearly no trees cover the southern slopes of the Shiwalik mountain in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Seasonal torrents are known as Chos deeply slash these slopes. The hills belong to antisynclines or anticlines, while valleys belong to synclines.\n\nShiwalik Hills were created by the conglomerate\u2019s accumulation. During the first stages of deposition, these conglomerates created transient lakes.\n\nThese transient lakes gathered an increasing amount of conglomerates over time. At the bottom of the lakes, the aggregates were firmly established.\n\nConglomerate-filled lakes were drained away when rivers were able to cut through them, leaving behind plains known as \u201cduns\u201d or \u201cdoons\u201d in the west and \u201cduars\u201d in the east. The best illustration is Dehra Dun in Uttarakhand.\n\nPurvanchal or Eastern Himalayas\n\nThe Himalayas\u2019 southern extension, known as the Eastern Hills or The Purvanchal, runs along India\u2019s northeastern border.\n\nThe Purvanchal is a group of relatively low hills that are formed when the Himalayas abruptly curve southward near the Dihang canyon.\n\nThey stretch from Arunachal Pradesh in the north to Mizoram in the south along the border between India and Myanmar.\n\nSignificance\n\nIt is a heaven for naturalists because of the incredible variety of plants and animals, which is brought about by the general temperature changes as one ascends higher.\n\nDeodars, azaleas, pines, firs, tigers, snow leopards, sparrows, cormorants, snow partridges, snow cocks, and snow pigeons are just a few of the plants and animals that alter with elevation and temperature.\n\nThe Himalayas have protected India from foreign incursions as a protective barrier since ancient times.\n\nIndia\u2019s climate is significantly impacted by the Himalayas. The summer monsoons from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are successfully deflected by them.\n\nThe Himalayan mountains are the source of almost all of India\u2019s major rivers. Ample rainfall serves as the food source for India\u2019s powerful rivers.\n\nRead:\u00a0Hindu Kush Himalaya\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav.",

The Western Ghats are home to 30% of flora and fauna species found in India.\n\n39 Western Ghats series sites were added to UNESCO\u2019s list of World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe Western Ghats are known as Sahyadri in northern Maharashtra, Sahya Parvatam in Kerala and Nilagiri Malai in Tamil Nadu.\n\nStates and Union Territories under the Western Ghats\n\nSix states\u2014Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala\u2014as well as two Union Territories\u2014Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Pondicherry\u2014are home to the mountain region.\n\nThe range begins near the Gujarati border, south of the Tapti river, where the eastern part of Dadra and Silvassa in D&N is occupied by the foothills of the mountains. It ends at Kerala\u2019s Anamudi peak, almost 1600 kilometres south of where it began.\n\nMahe in Pondicherry is situated on the Malabar coast on the Western Ghats surrounded by Kerala.\n\nMountains in the Western Ghats\nNumerous hill towns, including Matheran, Lonavala-Khandala, Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani, Amboli Ghat, Kudremukh, and Kodagu, may be found in the mountain region.\nThe extreme northern parts of Western Ghats fall in the Dangs district of Gujarat, known for the Dang (Bamboo) forests.\nThe Eastern and Western Ghats converge in Karnataka near Biligirirangan Hills. The highest peak in the mountain region is Anamudi, which is 2,695 metres high. The highest peak in Karnataka is Mullayanagiri, which rises 1,950 metres.\nThey conjoin the Anaimalai Hills to the northwest, the Palni Hills to the northeast and the Agasthyamalai Hills to the south as far as the Ariankavu pass.\nThere are many important passes in the Western Ghats such as Tamhini Ghat, Palakkad Gap, Naneghat, Kasara ghat etc.\nThe short coastal plain between the mountain region and the Arabian Sea is divided into three parts: the northern part, known as the Konkan Coast, the centre part, known as Kanara, and the southern part, known as the Malabar area or the Malabar Coast.\nThe foothill region east of the Ghats in Maharashtra is known as Desh, while the eastern foothills of the central Karnataka state are known as Malenadu.\nRivers in the Western Ghats\nPeninsular India is home to 245 million people, most of whom depend on rivers coming from the mountain region for their water supply.\nThe rivers that originate in the Western Ghats and flow towards the west are Periyar, Bharathappuzha, Netravati, Sharavathi, Mandovi etc.\nThe Western Ghats\u2019 westward-flowing rivers move quickly because of their short travel distance and greater grade. Because of this, the Western Ghats are more advantageous for producing hydroelectricity than the Eastern Ghats.\nThe steep gradient makes the Jog Falls on the Shravasthi River in Karnataka one of the most spectacular waterfalls in India. Narmada and Tapti although don\u2019t rise from the Western Ghats but flow westwards.\nThe rivers that originate in the mountain region and flow towards the east include three major rivers viz.\u00a0 The Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri, and many smaller / tributary rivers such as Tunga, Bhadra, Bhima, Malaprabha, Ghataprabha, Hemavathi, and Kabini.\nThese east-flowing rivers are comparatively slower moving and eventually merge into larger rivers such as the Kaveri and Krishna.\n\nAlso read: Hills of Peninsular India\n\nClimate of Western Ghats\nDue to the mountains\u2019 ability to obstruct rain-bringing westerly monsoon winds, the western side of the Western Ghats receives more rainfall than its eastern side. It, therefore, has a significant impact on the pattern and intensity of India\u2019s monsoonal rainfall.\nThe dense forests also contribute to high orographic precipitation. The climate is humid and tropical in the lower reaches tempered by the proximity to the sea.\nElevations of 1,500 m and above in the north and 2,000 m and above in the south have a more temperate climate.\nHere, the yearly average temperature is close to 15 \u00b0C. Some regions frequently get frost, and the winter months have temperatures below freezing. 20 \u00b0C in the south to 24 \u00b0C in the north are the average temperatures. Additionally, it has been shown that the South Western Ghats\u2019 coldest and wettest seasons are related.\nDuring the monsoon season between June and September, the unbroken Western Ghats chain acts as a barrier to the moisture-laden clouds. The heavy, eastward-moving rain-bearing clouds are forced to rise and in the process deposit most of their rain on the windward side. Rainfall in this region averages 3,000\u20134,000 mm.\nThe eastern region of the mountain region which lies in the rain shadow receives far less rainfall averaging about 1,000 mm bringing the average rainfall figure to 2,500 mm.\nVegetation of Western Ghats\nThe vegetation on high hills differs from that on low slopes as well. As a result, the Western Ghats are home to a wide variety of plants.\nThe western slopes have tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests marked predominantly by Rosewood, Mahogany, Cedar etc. These slopes appear green in almost all parts of the year. No time is fixed when these trees would shade their leaves.\nThe eastern slopes of the mountain region have dry as well as moist deciduous forests marked predominantly by Teak, Sal, Shisham, Sandalwood etc. trees.\nFurther, on the northern side of the Wayanad forests; we find dry deciduous forests while on the southern side there are wet deciduous forests. The evergreen Wayanad forests of Kerala mark the transition zone between the northern and southern ecoregions of the mountain regions.\nThe southern ecoregions are generally wetter and more species-rich. South Western Ghats Montane rain forests are the most species-rich ecoregions in peninsular India. 80% of the flowering plant species of the entire Western Ghats range are found in this ecoregion.\nThe areas which are high in elevation are cooler and wetter in the north and so the forests there are called North Western Ghats Montane rain forests. There are montane grasslands as well as stunted forests also in the Western Ghats.\n\u00a0Protected Areas in the Western Ghats\n\nThe Western Ghats is home to India\u2019s two biosphere reserves, 13 National parks, several wildlife sanctuaries and many Reserve Forests.\n\n1. The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve comprises 5500 km\u00b2 of the evergreen forests of\n\nNagarahole\nDeciduous forests of Bandipur National Park\nNugu in Karnataka\nWayanad\nMudumalai National Park in the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu forms the largest contiguous protected area in the Western Ghats.\n\n2. The Silent Valley National Park in Kerala is among the last tracts of virgin tropical evergreen forest in India.\n\nBiological diversity\n\nNumerous types of flora and wildlife, including hundreds of species that are threatened with extinction globally, may be found in the Western Ghats. Many of these species are also endemic to the region. Covering an area of 180,000 sq. km, or just under 6 per cent of the land area of India,\n\nThe Western Ghats are home to over 5000 species of flowering plants, 139 mammal species, 508 bird species 179 amphibian species, and many undiscovered species.\n\nIt contains more than 30 per cent of all the plant, fish, herpeto-fauna, bird, and mammal species found in India.\n\nThe mountain region includes a diversity of medicinal plants and important genetic resources such as the wild relatives of grains, fruit and spices.\n\nSome endemic species of the mountain region include the Malabar large-spotted Civet, Lion-tailed Macaque, Nilgiri Tahr and Brown Palm Civet\n\nBiodiversity Crisis\n\nThe Western Ghats are under rising population and development pressure, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature 2020.\n\nThis requires intensive and targeted management efforts to conserve the existing values and also remediate past damages.\n\nMadhav Gadgil\u2019s committee reiterated that human interference and unscientific land use had worsened the already damaged ecosystem of the mountain region.\n\nClimate change and Global warming have led to big variations in the duration and intensity of rainfalls in the region.\n\nRelated Posts\nEastern Ghats: Explained\nGadgil Report and Kasturirangan Report on Western Ghats\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

    "[CONTENT] #321": "What is Permafrost? What Is Permafrost Made Of? What are the consequences of Permafrost thawing? Read all about this\n\nThe primary cause of the 20,000-tonne oil leak at a Russian power station in the Arctic area is now recognized to have been the sinking ground surface caused by permafrost thawing.\n\nAlso, read about Cold deserts in India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Permafrost?\nWhat is Permafrost made of?\nPermafrost thawing\nCauses\nConsequences of Permafrost thawing\nWay forward\nConclusion\nWhat is Permafrost?\nPermafrost is any ground that remains completely frozen\u201432\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) or colder\u2014for at least two years straight.\nThe higher latitudes and elevations of Earth\u2014close to the North and South Poles\u2014are where these permanently frozen lands are most prevalent.\nAt lower latitudes, permafrost is found at high-altitude locations such as the Alps, the Tibetian plateau, South American Andes, the Rocky mountains etc.\nThe permafrost is believed to have formed during glacial periods dating several millennia.\nPermafrost covers a huge section of the planet. Over 25% of the area in the Northern Hemisphere is covered with permafrost.\nAlthough the surface layer that covers permafrost, known as the \u201cactive layer,\u201d is constantly frozen. The active layer freezes in the winter and thaws in the summer. Even in the summer, the ground in frigid areas rarely thaws. The active layer is barely 4 to 6 inches thick there (10 to 15 centimetres). The active layer can reach heights of several metres in permafrost regions that are warmer.\nIts thickness gradually decreases towards the south and is influenced by various additional elements, including the heat of the planet\u2019s interior, the amount of snow and vegetation, the presence of water bodies, and geography.\nWhat is Permafrost made of?\nIce holds together a mixture of soil, boulders, and sand to form permafrost. In permafrost, the soil and ice remain frozen throughout the year.\nNear the surface, permafrost soils are also rich in organic carbon, which is a by-product of dead plants that the cold prevented from decomposing or rotting away. Soils comprised primarily of minerals can be found in the lower permafrost layers.\nThe dead remains of plants, animals, and microbes that were frozen before they could decompose can be found in great quantities beneath the surface of permafrost. It also contains a vast collection of pathogens.\nPermafrost thawing\nPermafrost thawing means the ice inside the permafrost melts, leaving behind water and soil.\nPeat, the partially decomposed vegetation that accumulates in water-saturated conditions without oxygen, helps to preserve permafrost from the effects of climate change. Peat, which can cover or completely enclose the active layer or be frozen as permafrost, is a common substance throughout much of the low Arctic.\nCauses\nArctic warming: The pace of temperature change in the Arctic is currently the highest in the past 2,000 years, with the region rising twice as quickly as the rest of the planet. Temperatures in the Arctic permafrost were 3.5 degrees Celsius higher in 2016 than they were at the start of the 20th century.\nWildfires can peel back the peat and make permafrost more sensitive to climate change and hence leading to thawing.\nPositive feedback loop: It will speed up warming when permafrost releases its carbon as CO2 or methane, which will subsequently cause more permafrost to melt.\nConsequences of Permafrost thawing\nInfrastructure collapse: Many constructions are there on permafrost. Permafrost is more durable than concrete when it is frozen. Permafrost thawing, however, can ruin buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. Using the Thermal Power Plant of Norilsk-Taimyr Energy as an example, a fuel storage tank failed.\nAltered landscapes: As temperatures rise, the permafrost\u2019s binding ice melts, leaving the ground unstable and increasing the likelihood of significant landslides, floods, and potholes.\nEmission of Greenhouse gases: Microbes start breaking down this substance as the permafrost thaws. Methane and carbon dioxide are two greenhouse gases that are released during this process. Permafrost grounds could release greenhouse gases equivalent to 4-6 years\u2019 worth of coal, oil, and natural gas emissions for every 1 degree Celsius increase in average temperature, according to research, becoming a significant contributor to climate change in and of itself.\nRelease of microorganisms: Ancient bacteria and viruses present in the soil and ice also defrost when permafrost melts. Animals and humans could become seriously ill from these recently unfrozen microorganisms. In permafrost that has thawed, researchers have found bacteria that are more than 400,000 years old.\nBoth Arctic animals and indigenous people are in danger of thawing.\nWay forward\nReducing our carbon footprint.\nInvesting in energy-efficient products.\nSupporting climate-friendly businesses, legislation, and policies.\nConclusion\n\n\u00a0In comparison to the near eradication of permafrost under our current warming trajectory, 55 to 70% of the permafrost land area might be preserved if countries adhere to the Paris Agreement and keep the global average temperature to 1.5 to 20C over pre-industrial levels.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

Typically, a drainage divide is a ridge or a high platform.\n\nDifferent Drainage Pattern Types\n\nSeveral drainage patterns depend on the shape and creation of river patterns. It can be broadly divided into two types:\n\nDiscordant Drainage Pattern\nConcordant Drainage Pattern\n\nDiscordant Drainage Pattern\n\nIt has no relation to the local topography or geology. Despite topographic changes, the river in the discordant drainage pattern stays on its original course.\n\nThe discordant drainage pattern is further divided into Antecedent and the Superimposed drainage pattern.\n\nAntecedent Drainage (Discordant Drainage)\n\nIt is also known as inconsequential drainage. When a piece of a river slope and its surroundings are raised, the river maintains its previous slope while cutting through the uplifted area, creating deep gorges known as vertical erosion or vertical downcutting.\n\nRivers like the Indus, Sutlej, Brahmaputra, and other Himalayan rivers are examples of antecedent rivers or drainage.\n\nSuperimposed Drainage Pattern(Discordant Drainage)\n\nThe harder basal rocks appear unrelated to the tougher rock bed when a river flowing over a softer rock stratum reaches them while following the initial slope. The term \u201csuperimposed drainage\u201d refers to this sort of drainage.\n\nThe hardness and softness of the rock and the patterns of faults or fractures frequently have a significant impact on the drainage patterns (dendritic, trellis, etc.).\n\nHowever, on occasion, the land swiftly rises with the stream\u2019s initial level. Increasing the stream\u2019s gradient increases the erosive force of the stream.\n\nSome excellent examples of superimposed drainage may be seen in the rivers flowing at the Rewa Plateau, including the Damodar, Subarnarekha, Chambal, Banas, and others.\n\nConcordant Drainage Pattern\n\nIt is related to the local topology and geology. The slope of the river and the topography have a significant role in determining the course of the river in a concordant drainage pattern.\n\nThese drainage systems are the most prevalent and can be divided into two groups: Consequent drainage rivers and Subsequent drainage rivers.\n\nConsequent Drainage Rivers (Concordant Drainage)\n\nWhen the river flows generally in the direction of the slope, there is a consequent drainage system.\n\nPeninsular Indian rivers including the Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery pour into the Bay of Bengal after descending from the Western Ghats. They are the examples of the consequent Drainage pattern.\n\nSubsequent River System (Concordant Drainage)\n\nStreams that are formed after the original stream (which is consequent rivers) are considered as the Subsequent River System.\n\nOnce the primary drainage pattern has been formed, it is a subsidiary stream that erodes along an underlying band of non-resistant rock.\n\nFor instance, the Yamuna and the Ganga are met at right angles by the drainage rivers Chambal, Sind, Ken, Betwa, Tons, and Son.\n\nDifferent Drainage Pattern Types\nDendritic Drainage Pattern\n\nThe most typical type is called a dendritic drainage pattern. It resembles tree roots\u2019 branching pattern.\n\nA dendritic pattern forms where the river channel follows the terrain\u2019s slope.\n\nThe pattern appears where there is no distinctive structure in the rock under the stream and where erosion is equally easy in all directions.\n\nE.g. The Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra rivers that flow through the northern plains.\n\nParallel Drainage Pattern\n\nIt grows in areas with elongated, parallel landforms and a sharp slope to the surface.\n\nIn general, tributary streams follow the slope of the surface by spreading out in a parallel-like pattern.\n\nLike the Godavari, Kaveri, Krishna, and Tungabhadra rivers, which have their source in the Western Ghats.\n\nRadial Drainage Pattern\n\nThe radial drainage pattern, which forms around a central high point, is typical of conically shaped objects like volcanoes.\n\nThe drainage pattern is referred to as \u201cradial\u201d when the rivers originate on a hill and flow in all directions.\n\nFor instance, the Narmada and Son rivers, flow from the Amarkantak range.\n\nThe pattern of Centripetal Drainage\n\nIt is the exact opposite of the radial as here streams move in the direction of a central depression.\n\nThese streams nourish ephemeral lakes throughout the rainier seasons of the year, but they vanish during the drier seasons.\n\nWhen salt dissolved in lakewater precipitates out of the solution and is left behind when the water evaporates, salt flats can also occasionally be formed in these dry lake beds.\n\nFor instance, Manipur\u2019s Loktak Lake.\n\nTrellis Drainage Pattern\n\nHard and soft rocks are parallel to one another in folded topography, where trellis drainage arises.\n\nSynclines, which are downturned folds, create valleys where the main channel of the stream is located.\n\nWhen secondary tributaries join principal tributaries of main rivers at right angles, a pattern similar to this is created.\n\nFor instance, the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra rivers in the high Himalayan region.\n\nRectangular Drainage Pattern\n\nIn areas that have experienced faulting, the rectangular drainage pattern is present. It grows on rocky ground that is tightly connected.\n\nStreams cluster in areas where exposed rock is weakest because they take the path of least resistance. The tributary streams enter the mainstream at acute angles and create steep bends. E.g. streams in Chambal, ken, and betwa.\n\nBarbed Drainage Pattern\n\nIt is a drainage pattern in which the confluence of a tributary with the main river is indicated by a discordant junction, as if the tributary meant to flow upward rather than downstream.\n\nThis pattern develops when the main river is captured and changes its flow direction, while the tributaries continue to point in the previous flow direction.\n\nAn intriguing example of a barbed drainage system is the Arun River in Nepal, a tributary of the Kosi.\n\nAnnular Drainage Pattern\n\nThe radial streams develop further tributaries. These tributaries attempt to follow a circular drainage pattern around the top when the upland has an outer soft layer. In India, this drainage pattern is not particularly typical.\n\nFor instance, South Dakota\u2019s Black Hill streams\n\nDeranged Drainage Pattern\n\nThe rivers and lakes do not follow a logical pattern.\n\nThese patterns are developed when the previous drainage system is disturbed.\n\nFor instance, the glaciated valleys of the Karakoram.\n\nAngular Drainage Pattern\n\nThese patterns are created where the bedrock joints and faults connect at sharper angles.\n\nThis pattern is typical in the foothills of the Himalayas.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav.",

According to how they begin, environmental hazards and associated natural disasters are divided into two groups:\nDisasters with a slow start, like drought or desertification, develop gradually, making it challenging to predict when they will start and stop. There is no single indicator or index that can accurately pinpoint the beginning and severity of the event; the duration might range from months to years. The effects are typically non-structural and challenging to measure.\nDrought occurrences, which can be categorised as meteorological, hydrological, or agricultural droughts, occur when there is insufficient water to meet the regular needs of agriculture, cattle, industry, or the human population.\nDesertification takes place on bigger time- and space scales. Additionally, because of their possible length of time, the focal point frequently changes over time, necessitating ongoing monitoring of climate and water supply indicators.\nRapid-onset disasters are defined by the impacts\u2019 suddenness and acute intensity over a brief period of time. The loss of lives and property caused by a specific disaster event is typically used to measure the severity of rapid-onset disasters. Rapid-onset catastrophes do not allow individuals enough time to reduce the danger of an event happening because of the way they start.\nThe Himalayan region is extremely vulnerable to rapid-onset hydrologic, meteorological, and geologic disasters because of its fragility, geo-tectonic features, and extraordinary susceptibility to climate change. Due to the area\u2019s remoteness and accessibility, it is difficult to respond in a timely manner, and the lack of a thorough understanding of its natural dynamics makes it difficult to take precautions or issue alerts or early warnings.\nGeo-physical Disasters: They come from events or natural earth processes. The term \u201cgeological hazard\u201d refers to both geomorphic processes such as mass movements like landslides, rockslides, rock falls, avalanches, the surface collapses, etc. as well as internal earth processes of tectonic origin, such as earthquakes, geological fault activity, tsunamis, and volcanic activity.\nThe mass movements occurring at a greater pace are more dangerous e.g. rock falls, which often occur without any warning.\nDrought frequency is rising due to global warming, which dries up water holes. The frequency of wildfires that change desert landscapes by destroying slow-growing trees and shrubs and replacing them with quickly-growing grasses may increase as temperatures rise.\nThe low adaptive capacity of the socio-ecological system.\nWay Forward\n\nIt can be challenging to try to stop desertification in some situations. Research and technological developments that push the boundaries of what we currently know is required under certain circumstances. We might discover more strategies to avert the devastation it brings about, thanks to advancements.\n\nThe worrying trend is the increase in desertification and expansion of both types of deserts. Natural causes for desert formation have been from times immemorial, it is the anthropogenic causes that are a cause of concern. The plan of action to combat desertification needs to be in line with the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

As a result, low pressure is created.\nOn the contrary, cooling results in contraction. As a result, the density rises and the pressure rises.\nExamples of thermal lows and highs are the formation of equatorial lows and polar highs, respectively.\n\nDynamic Elements:\n\nIn addition to temperature changes, the dynamic elements resulting from pressure gradient forces and earth rotation can be used to explain how pressure belts form Coriolis force.\nClassification\n\nBased on the mass-energy exchange mechanism between the earth and the atmosphere and within the atmosphere several sequential pressure belts can be classified from the equator toward the pole.\n\nThere are seven pressure belts on the surface of the world. There are the two Subtropical highs, the two Subpolar lows, the two Polar highs, and the Equatorial Low.\n\nEquatorial low-pressure belt\n\nIt is a thermally induced pressure belt created by almost vertical solar insolation throughout the year. It is found near the equator between 5 degrees north and south latitude.\n\nHigh range of insolation heating and extreme thermal conditions. Air parcels over the surface of the earth remain relatively warmer and up well from the surface in the form of convection currents to create low-pressure conditions over the surface.\nSince insulation heating and convection remained persistent and permanent phenomena over the equator, a vacuum type of atmospheric condition developed over the surface, called Doldrums.\n\nSignificance:\n\nContributes to the development of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), where trade winds converge and result in significant rainfall.\nPlays a crucial role in the Earth\u2019s heat redistribution by initiating the Hadley cell circulation.\nSubtropical high-pressure belt\n\nIt is a dynamically induced pressure belt developed over subtropical latitudes by regular subsidence of air masses originating from the equator. It is found around 30 degrees north and south latitudes.\n\nSubtropical latitudes are referred to symbolically as horse latitudes. It is because subsiding air parcels apply tremendous pressure over the earth\u2019s surface and wind drifts away from the surface to fill the low-pressure vacuum of the equator and sub-polar latitude.\nConsequently, a vacuum type of atmospheric conditions develops over the surface where the horizontal movement of air parcels remains very low.\n\nSignificance:\n\nLeads to the formation of subtropical deserts, such as the Sahara in Africa and the Sonoran in North America.\nInfluences the trade winds that blow towards the equator.\nSubpolar low-pressure belt\n\nIt is developed between 55 to 65 degrees northern and Southern hemispheres by several dynamic and thermal components. Relative low-pressure condition is acknowledged over the polar surface since they lie between two prominent high-pressure zones of sub-trophic and polar origin.\n\nAtmospheric conditions over subpolar latitude remain comparatively high to the Polar surface. Consequently, warm and comparatively like their forces of subpolar origin apply less pressure over the surface, creating a low-pressure condition\nCold and dense air masses initially meeting from polar high-pressure belts and advancing towards subpolar low-pressure vacuum also cover more surface area and the net pressure applied by them shall subsequently decrease.\n\nThe surface of some polar latitude always remains a converging zone of two contrasting air masses. Air masses originating from polar and subtropical high-pressure belts are distinct in their physical properties and implications.\n\nWhen these contrasting air masses converge with each other a transition zone or boundary known as a front develops between the distinct air masses and the boundary ultimately transforms into a zone of turbulence between the contrasting air masses.\nAlong the boundary of the front always a warm air mass up well or take up lifted from the surface chased by the high-pressure condition of a cold air parcel originating from a higher latitude.\nAs a result, both warm and cold air parcels get up and lifted from the surface and the next pressure applied by themselves subsequently be low.\n\nSignificance:\n\nContributes to the development of the polar front, a zone of weather systems and storms.\nInfluences the westerlies, the prevailing winds in the mid-latitudes.\nPolar high-pressure belt\n\nIt is again a thermally induced Pressure Belt characterized by almost incline and solar insolation, less insulation and heating, and subsidence of cold and denser air parcels.\n\nThis pressure belt system is an abstract representation. The Pressure belt placement is not fixed.\nAs they move between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, they move northward in July and southward in January, following the shifting positions of the sun\u2019s direct rays. The belt of maximum temperature usually referred to as the thermal equator also moves north and south of the equator.\nThere is a shift in pressure belts to the north and south of their yearly average location along with the thermal equator\u2019s movement northward in summer and southward in winter.\nIntertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)\n\nA region near the equator where the trade winds converge.\n\nAssociated with low pressure and rising warm, moist air.\nExperiences intense convection and thunderstorm activity.\n\nSignificance:\n\nPlays a crucial role in the global water cycle and tropical weather patterns.\nAffects the distribution of rainfall and the development of monsoons.\nOverall Significance of Pressure Belts\nGlobal Wind Patterns:\u00a0Pressure belts influence the development of global wind patterns, including trade winds, westerlies, and polar easterlies.\nClimate Zones:\u00a0Pressure belts contribute to the establishment of major climate zones, such as tropical, subtropical, and polar climates.\nWeather Systems:\u00a0The interaction of pressure belts leads to the formation of weather systems, including cyclones, anticyclones, and monsoons.\nOcean Circulation:\u00a0Atmospheric circulation driven by pressure belts influences ocean currents, playing a role in the distribution of heat around the globe.\n\nUnderstanding pressure belts is fundamental to comprehending the Earth\u2019s atmospheric circulation and the resulting weather and climate patterns.

Kachchh was formerly a gulf. During the monsoons, the Kachchh region is separated into the Great Rann in the north and the Little Rann in the east by shallow water. Kathiawar, on the other hand, is located south of Kachchh.\n\nKonkan coast: It stretches from Goa in the south to Daman in the north. The two main crops in this area are cashews and rice.\n\nKannada coast: It stretches between Marmagaon and Mangalore and is known as the Kannada coast.\n\nMalabar coast: The comparatively broad Malabar coast stretches from Mangalore to Kanyakumari. Lagoons that run parallel to the coast are also part of this area in southern Kerala.\n\nIndian Eastern Coastal Plains\n\nThe eastern coastal plains pass through Andhra Pradesh and Odisha as they travel from West Bengal in the north to Tamil Nadu in the south. The eastern coastal plain contains the deltas of the Mahanadi, Krishna, Godavari, and Cauveri rivers.\n\nThe deltas are incredibly fertile and agriculturally productive. As a result, the River Krishna\u2019s delta is referred to as the \u201cGranary of South India.\u201d\n\nThree groups make up the Eastern coast\n\nUtkal coast: The Utkal coast is substantially wider than the western coastal plains and experiences a great deal of rainfall.

Usually, this is referred to as a moraine.\n\nAn unstable mound of debris and submerged ice has the potential to contain these lakes.\n\nThe majority of today\u2019s moraine-dammed lakes were created as mountain glaciers started to retreat from sizable moraines built during the Little Ice Age.\n\nIce-Dammed lakes\n\nIn contrast to lakes that have been dammed by moraines, lakes that have been blocked from draining by advancing or thicker glaciers are known as ice-dammed lakes.\n\nAnywhere a glacier obstructs the drainage of meltwater, lakes become ice-dammed.\n\nWhile ice-dammed GLOFs pose the greatest threat during times of glacier growth, moraine-dammed GLOFs typically pose the greatest threat during times of glacier retreat.\n\nTherefore, it is anticipated that as mountain glaciers continue to recede globally, the number of GLOFs dammed by moraines will rise.\n\nWhy does a glacier break?\n\nDue to Erosion.\nA rise in water pressure.\nAn avalanche of snow or rocks.\nAn earthquake under the ice.\nMassive water displacement in a glacial lake is caused by the collapse of a large portion of an adjacent glacier into it.\nSignificance of GLOFs\n\nOver 5,000 glacier lakes that are being held back by potentially unstable moraines have been slowly created by the Himalayan Mountains\u2019 ongoing glacier melt.\n\nThe GLOFs that result from such dam failures can have disastrous social and geomorphic effects.\n\nMany new glacial lakes, which are the main cause of GLOFs, have formed as a result of glacial retreat brought on by climate change that is present in the majority of the Hindu Kush Himalayas.\n\nTo know more about urban flooding click here.\n\nHow we can mitigate the impacts of GLOFs\nIn the wake of the disaster in Chamoli, the National Disaster Management Authority released guidelines on how to deal with disasters caused by GLOFs.\nThe guidelines state that risk reduction starts with the identification and mapping of glacial lakes, followed by the implementation of structural measures to prevent a breach and the development of reliable systems to protect people and property in the event of a breach.\nIdentification of potentially hazardous lakes \u2013 By using field observations, historical event records, the geotechnical and geomorphologic characteristics of the lake or dam, and the surroundings, it is possible to identify potentially dangerous lakes. And determining additional physical problems.\nUse of technology \u2013 During the monsoon season, Synthetic-Aperture radar imagery is used to automatically detect changes in water bodies, including the formation of new lakes. Allow remote monitoring of lake bodies from space.\nTo reduce the amount of water in lakes so that they can be managed structurally, the NDMA suggests techniques like controlled breaching, pumping or diverting out water, digging a tunnel through the moraine barrier, or beneath an ice dam.\nUniform codes for construction activity: Establishing a comprehensive framework for excavation, construction, and infrastructure development in vulnerable areas. In areas where GLOFs are likely to occur, land use planning procedures must be accepted.\nTraining local people\u2013 Since residents are often the first to respond to a disaster before trained rescue personnel, it is important to train them in search and rescue procedures.\nImprovement of early warning systems: Even on a global scale, there are very few GLOF EWS that have been implemented and are in operation. Three instances of the use of sensor and monitoring-based technical systems for GLOF early warning in the Himalayan region have been documented (two in Nepal and one in China).\n\nGLOFs now present a threat to infrastructure and communities downstream. In the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra basins, there are, respectively, 352,283 and 1,393 glacial lakes and water bodies, according to a study funded by the Central Water Commission and conducted between 2011 and 2015.\n\nArticle Written by Remya",

According to the Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA), there are about 93 jute mills in India.\n\nAt Rishira, 20 km north of Calcutta, the first jute mill/factory in India was founded in 1854. After gaining its independence, India experienced a setback because the majority of the jute-growing areas were still in Bangladesh and the jute factories were still located in India.\n\nThe jute textile industry has recently emerged as one of the key sectors serving East India, particularly West Bengal.\n\nAround 40 lakh agricultural families are supported by this business, which also directly employs 1.4 lakh people in the tertiary sector and 2.6 lakh people in the manufacturing sector.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat are the steps involved in the cultivation of raw jute?\n\nThe production process in the jute industry involves several steps, including the processing of jute fibres, spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, finishing, and selling of both the raw jute and its completed goods.\n\nAs a result, despite the industry\u2019s many challenges, its labour-to-output ratio is likewise high.\n\nKnow more about Major Crops and Cropping Patterns in Various Parts of the Country click here.\n\nChallenges/Concerns of Jute Industry in India\n\u00a0Because of the lack of modernization by the majority of jute mills and the availability of high-quality raw jute, the industry is now reliant on government assistance such as packaging reserves.\nOnly a section of the industry has diversified into non-packaging segments.\nThe majority of these industries continue to make venerable goods like jute sacking, hessian used as packing material, and to a lesser extent carpet backing.\nThe machines\u2019 efficiency falls short of expectations because they are made of extremely outdated, primitive technology.\nDue to frequent breakdowns, defective and inferior quality products are being made.\nInput cost is increasing day by day which is affecting its competitiveness.\nThe international export market is currently facing fierce competition from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and China, which poses a danger to India. Despite India\u2019s proportion of global output gradually declining, its net export value is rising daily.\nThe jute business experiences significant losses as a result of various political meddling, labor issues, and a scarcity of jute fiber due to insufficient rainfall.\nAlternative Materials: The Indian subcontinent has a highly localized jute industry. To counteract India\u2019s monopoly over jute products, other nations were driven to develop jute alternatives due to their heavy reliance on India\u2019s irregular jute supply. Some of the nations built their jute mills in which Bangladesh supplied the raw material. Jute mills have been constructed in Japan, Korea, and the West European nations.\nGovernment Initiative to support Jute Industry in India\nJute Integrated Development Scheme (JIDS)\n\nThe JID Scheme intends to establish local agencies and units in remote areas of the nation by working with legitimate organizations to carry out various tasks.\n\nThe role of ID agencies is that of a facilitator, delivering Basic, Advanced, and Design Development training programs.\n\nThey also provide backward and forward links to the existing and potential entrepreneurs at the grass-roots level.\n\nAnd focusing primarily on technology application and design/product development and dissemination.\n\nJute Technology Mission (JTM)\n\nJute Technology Mission (JTM) was approved by the government of India in 2006 and it has 4 mini Missions.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MINI MISSION\n\t\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ACTIVITY\n\t\nRELATED ORGANISATION\n\n\n\u00a0Mini Mission \u2013 I\n\t\nResearch activities on Jute\n\t\nICAR (DARE)\n\n\n\u00a0Mini Mission \u2013 II\n\t\nDevelopment/extension of raw jute agriculture\n\t\nMinistry of Agriculture(DAC), Govt. of India, State Govt.\n\n\n\u00a0Mini Mission \u2013 III\n\t\nMarketing of raw jute\n\t\nMinistry of Textiles Govt. of India\n\n\n\u00a0Mini Mission \u2013 IV\n\t\nProcessing, utilisation and industrial aspects of raw jute\n\t\nMinistry of Textiles, Govt. of India\n\nThe Jute Technology Mission (JTM) was executed during the XIth five-year Plan with an overall outlay of Rs. 355.56 crores.\n\nThe main objectives are:\n\nDevelop high-yielding varieties to improve productivity and acceptability in markets.\nImprove retting practices to get better quality fiber.\nTransfer of cost-effective technologies to the farmers.\nCreate strong market linkages.\nExpand the scope for the marketing of diversified jute products within the country and abroad.\nJute Raw Material Bank (JRMB) Scheme\nThe program\u2019s goal is to make domestically produced jute raw material affordable for small and independent business owners and artisans while also ensuring the long-term viability of the nation\u2019s decentralized JDP industry.\nJUTE \u2013ICARE (Jute: Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise)\n\nThrough this program, farmers have been encouraged to grow jute by utilizing certified seeds, implementing scientific jute cultivation practices, and retting to produce quality jute, boost productivity, and lower the cost of jute production for jute farmers.\n\nThe Jute Foundation (TJF)\n\nTJF is trying to address many issues about the environment-friendly product.

However, the prospects to profit from Jute diversification strategies would remain slim without supporting initiatives of research-based commercialization supported by good government policies.\nSuggest norms of efficiency for the jute industry to eliminate waste, obtain optimum production, improve quality and reducing costs.\nTo advance the growth of jute and jute products, organize workshops, conferences, lectures, seminars, refresher courses, study groups, and training programs.\nEnsure higher pay, benefits, and incentives are in place for jute industry workers, as well as improved amenities.\nJute manufacturers must maintain and expand their current markets, as well as create new ones both inside and outside the nation. Marketing plans must be developed to meet this demand in both domestic and worldwide markets.\nProvide and create necessary infrastructural facilities and conditions conducive to the development of diversified jute products by way of assisting the entrepreneurs, artisans, craftsman, designers, manufacturers, exporters, non-Governmental agencies in the following manner, namely\nTransfer of technology from research and development institutions and other organizations in India and abroad;\nProviding support services to the entrepreneurs for the implementation of their projects including technical guidance and training;\nOrganizing entrepreneurial development programs;\nPlanning and executing market promotion strategies including exhibitions, demonstrations, media campaigns in India and abroad.\n\nThe Jute industry occupies an important place in the national economy of India. It is estimated that the jute industry provides direct employment to 0.37 million workers in organized mills and diversified units including tertiary sector and allied activities and support the livelihood of around 4.0 million farm families. Besides, there are a large number of persons engaged.\n\nJute products that are biodegradable and environmentally friendly have a very large global market. But the domestic jute market urgently needs to diversify.\n\nThe urgent requirement is to modernize, adopt new industry standards and technologies, and progress through time. Through proper policy changes, the government must assist the jute industry and increase its competitiveness.\n\nPrelims Facts\n\nJute is the crop of hot and humid climate.\nIt is Carbon neutral crop.\nAlso known as \u2018golden fibre\u2019, is one of the longest and most used natural fibre for various textile applications.\nIncessant and untimely rainfalls as well as prolonged droughts are detrimental to this crop.\nLarge quantity of water is required not only for growing the crop but also for processing the fibre after the crop is harvested.\nIt requires high temperature varying from 24 Degrees Celsius to 35 Degrees Celsius and heavy rainfall of 120-150 cm with 80-90% relative humidity during the period of its growth.\nThe cultivation of jute in India is mainly confined to the eastern region of the country. The jute crop is grown in seven states \u2013 West Bengal, Assam, Orissa, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura and Meghalaya. West Bengal alone accounts for over 50% of the total raw jute production.\nJute is the 2nd abundant natural fibre in the World after Cotton. Almost 85% of world\u2019s jute cultivation is concentrated in the Ganges Delta.\nIndia is the World\u2019s biggest producer of Jute (raw jute and jute goods, contributing to over 50 percent and 40 percent respectively of global production), followed by Bangladesh.\n\nRead:\u00a0Golden fibre revolution\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

It covers an area of over 500,000 square kilometres (200,000 square miles). It rises to 1000 m in the south but dips to 500 m in the north.\nThe Deccan Plateau is triangular in shape and is bounded by the Satpura and Vindhya mountain ranges to the north, the Western Ghats to the west, and the Bay of Bengal to the east.\u00a0\nThe average elevation of the plateau is 600 metres above sea level. The highest point is Doddabetta Peak in Tamil Nadu, which rises to 2637 metres.\nThe Deccan Plateau: Rivers\nIts general slope is from west to east which is indicated by the flow of its major rivers. Rivers have further subdivided this plateau into a number of smaller plateaus. The majority of the rivers on the Deccan plateau flow south.\nThe Godavari River, which flows southeast, the Krishna River, which splits the peninsula into two parts, and the Pennai Aaru River, which flows north, all drain the plateau.\nThe Godavari River and its tributaries, notably the Indravati River, drain much of the northern half of the plateau, beginning in the Western Ghats and going east to the Bay of Bengal.\nThe Tungabhadra River, Krishna River, and its tributaries, notably the Bhima River, drain the majority of the central plateau.\nThe Kaveri River rises in Karnataka\u2019s Western Ghats and bends south to break through the Nilgiri Hills at the island town of Shivanasamudra.\nThen flows into Tamil Nadu at Hogenakkal Falls before flowing into the Stanley Reservoir and the Mettur Dam that created the reservoir, and finally emptying into the Bay of Bengal, which drains the southernmost part of the plateau.\nMoist deciduous, dry deciduous, and tropical thorn woods cover the plateau.\nThe Deccan Plateau: Climate\nThe Deccan Plateau has a tropical climate. The summers are hot and dry, while the winters are milder and drier. The plateau experiences very little rainfall, averaging only about 600 millimetres (24 inches) per year.\nThe climate of the Deccan Plateau varies from tropical in the lower regions to temperate in the higher regions. The rainfall also varies from region to region, depending on the monsoon winds.\nThe driest areas include\u00a0Rayalaseema and Vidarbha. Rain falls from June through October during the monsoon season.\nThe months of March through June may be extremely dry and hot, with temperatures often topping 35 degrees Celsius.\nThe climate on the plateau is drier than on the beaches, and it can be dry in some areas.\nAlthough the term Deccan is frequently used to refer to all of India south of the Narmada River, it refers to a region in the northern half of the peninsula with rich volcanic soils and lava-covered plateaus between the Narmada and Krishna rivers.\nThe Deccan Plateau: Population\nThe Deccan Plateau has a population of over 200 million people. The majority of the population is Hindu, with sizable minority populations of Muslims and Christians. Telugu is the most widely spoken language on the plateau, followed by Marathi and Kannada.\nThe Deccan Plateau is home to a large number of Indian tribes and languages.\u00a0\nThe major tribes are the Gonds, Bhils, Kols, Santhals, and Munda.\nBhil and Gond people reside in the hills of the plateau\u2019s northern and northeastern boundaries, speaking languages from both the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian families.\nThe plateau\u2019s huge expanses of residual forest are still home to a variety of grazing species, including the four-horned antelope chinkara and blackbuck, as well as the gaur and wild water buffalo.\nThe plateau is home to a variety of animal species, including the Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Asiatic elephant, and sloth bear.\u00a0\nThe Deccan Plateau: Economy\nThe Deccan Plateau is home to many industries, including mining, steel production, textiles, and chemicals. Agriculture is also an important part of the economy, with crops such as cereals, oilseeds and pulses (legumes) being grown on the plateau.\nThe Deccan Plateau is rich in mineral resources. Coal, iron ore, manganese, mica, bauxite, copper, limestone, and chromite are found in abundance here.\nAgriculture is the main occupation of the people living on the plateau.\nCotton textiles, sugar, foodstuffs, tobacco, paper, machine tools, and medicines are produced at industries located in Hyderabad, Warangal, and Kurnool.\nForest-based cottage businesses (timber, firewood, charcoal, bamboo goods) and mineral-based cottage industries (asbestos, coal, chromite, iron ore, mica, and kyanite).\nLivestock rearing is also an important economic activity.\nThe Deccan Plateau: Tourism\nThe Deccan Plateau has a rich cultural heritage.\nThe Deccan Plateau is home to several historical sites, including the Ajanta and Ellora caves, as well as the temples at Hampi.\nThe city of Hyderabad is also a popular tourist destination, with its Charminar monument and Hussain Sagar Lake.\nEcological structure of the Deccan Plateau:\n\nThe general meaning of geologic structure is the study of the distribution and types of rock on the surface and inside the surface. Geogolicaly structurally, the Deccan plateau can be divided into the following parts.\n\nArchaean Rock (4.5 Billion to 2.5 Billion years)\nArchaean rocks are first formed on the earth and it is the oldest rock and has no sign of fossil.\nArchean rocks are found in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana.\nDharwar Rocks (2.5 Billion to 1.8 Billion years)\nIt is the earliest sedimentary rock.\nIt is mainly found in Karnataka in the Deccan plateau.\nThe presence of Dharwar rocks is also present in Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Aravali, and Meghalaya.\nCuddapha Rocks (1.8 Billion to 540 million years)\n\nIt is mainly found in the Nallamalai hills of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\n\nGondwana Rocks (400 Million to 200 Million years)\nAbout 98 % of Indian rocks are found in Gondwana rocks.\nIt spreads in the Mahanadi and Godawari regions of the Deccan plateau.\nIt is also found in Chhotanagpur and Meghalaya plateau.\nDeccan Trap (80 to 66 Million years)\nIt is a basaltic volcanic origin.\nIt spreads in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana.\nRead more about the Deccan trap here.\nSignificance of Deccan Plateau:\nMinerals and precious stones abound on the Deccan level.\nNumerous marsh kings, especially those of the Mauryan (fourth second century BCE) and Gupta (fourth sixth century CE), fought for the level\u2019s mineral wealth.\nCoal, iron metal, asbestos, chromite, mica, and kyanite are among the significant minerals identified here.\nLow precipitation made agriculture difficult until the water system was introduced. At the moment, the zone under development is quite low, ranging from 60% in Maharashtra to roughly 10% in the Western Ghats.\nRice is the most important crop in high-precipitation areas, whereas sorghum is the most important crop in low-precipitation areas.\nCotton, tobacco, oilseeds, and sugar sticks are examples of massive crops.\nEspresso, tea, coconuts, areca, pepper, elastic, cashew nuts, custard, and cardamom are all widely grown on ranches in the Nilgiri Hills and the Western Ghats.\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

(Geo means \u201cearth,\u201d and thermal means \u201cheat\u201d in Greek.) It is a renewable resource that can be harvested for human use.\n\nGeothermal power is electrical power generated from geothermal energy. Technologies in use include dry steam power stations, flash steam power stations and binary cycle power stations. Geothermal energy is derived from a clean source, is dependable, and is unaffected by swings in fuel prices, allowing more financial resources to be given to economic development\n\nIt is found in the rocks and fluids beneath the earth\u2019s crust, down to the boiling molten rock, magma.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWells are excavated a mile down into underground reservoirs to obtain the steam and hot water, which may then be used to operate turbines attached to electricity generators.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe global trend in geothermal energy\nIndia\u2019s geothermal energy potential\nExtraction of Geothermal Heat Resources\nHydrothermal Heat source\nDeep\u00a0Geothermal System\nPower Produced by Geothermal Energy\nBenefits of geothermal energy\nDemerits\nGovernment initiatives\nDraft Geothermal Energy National Policy\nIndia\u2019s geothermal energy development framework\nConclusion\nThe global trend in geothermal energy\n\nGeothermal energy, first employed in Italy in 1904, has been a stable and expanding source of energy in recent years.\n\nOver 20 countries use geothermal energy.\n\nThe United States is the world\u2019s greatest generator of geothermal energy and is home to the world\u2019s largest geothermal field.\n\nIndonesia has 40% of the world\u2019s geothermal energy resources as the country has 130 active volcanoes and is a hub of tectonic plate movement.\n\nIndia\u2019s geothermal energy potential\n\nIndia includes seven geothermal provinces and around 340 geothermal springs.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, geothermal resources in India have been mapped, and a general estimate estimates that there could be a 10 gigatonne (GW) geothermal power potential (MNRE).\n\nTectonic factors mostly determine the occurrence of geothermal resources in India.\n\nThe primary zone of geothermal resources extends from Puga in Ladakh to Manikaran in Himachal Pradesh and Takshing in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nThe development of geothermal resources in India was languishing due to a lack of appropriate machinery and a lack of incentives.\n\nExtraction of Geothermal Heat Resources\nHydrothermal Heat source\n\nWater conducts heat to the surface and is recharged into the earth by rain or surface bodies (such as rivers, lakes, or glaciers) before being heated by underlying hot rock caused by seismic or volcanic activity.\n\nThe presence of hot springs in Iceland, the Himalayas, and the Alps demonstrates this.\n\nThe area\u2019s lithology must be porous in order for water to flow freely, both to replenish the system and to deliver hot water to the surface.\n\nDeep\u00a0Geothermal System\n\nDeep Geothermal systems, in which a deep borehole is excavated to reach the hot basal rock, and water is injected into the holes to produce steam\n\nThis way of resource extraction is utilised to power a turbine.\n\nThis method is rarely utilised since accessing the deep basal rock substrate is expensive.\n\nPower Produced by Geothermal Energy\n\nIn geothermal power plants, steam is used to generate electricity.\n\nHot water reservoirs a few miles or more beneath the earth\u2019s surface produce steam.\n\nThe steam turns a turbine, which turns a generator, which produces electricity.\n\nGeothermal power plants are classified into dry steam, flash steam, and binary steam.\n\nDry Steam \u2013 Dry steam power plants extract subterranean steam. Steam is delivered directly into a turbine/generator unit from subterranean wells.\nFlash Steam \u2013 The most popular type of power plant uses geothermal reservoirs of water with temperatures above 360\u00b0F (182\u00b0C). This boiling water rises via wells in the ground under its own pressure. As it goes upward, the pressure falls, and some hot water condenses into steam. The steam is utilised to power a turbine/generator after it has been extracted from the water. Any remaining water and condensed steam are injected back into the reservoir, ensuring the resource\u2019s long-term viability.\nBinary Steam \u2013 Binary cycle power plants operate at lower temperatures ranging from 225 to 360\u00b0F (107 to 182\u00b0C) and use water as fuel. The heat from the hot water is utilised to boil a working fluid, which is typically a low boiling point organic chemical. The working fluid of a heat exchanger is evaporated and used to turn a turbine. The water is then injected back into the earth to be warmed.\u00a0 There are minimal or no air emissions since the water and working fluid are maintained separate throughout the operation.\n\nBenefits of geothermal energy\nIt is cleaner fuel as it emits only one-sixth of the CO2 that a natural gas plant does.\nThe ongoing flow of heat from the Earth makes it infinite and inexhaustible making it a renewable resource\nIt is the only renewable energy available to mankind 24 hours a day, seven days a week that does not require storage and is unaffected by day-night or seasonal variations.\nGiven the need to replace coal-based electricity with alternative energy sources, it is critical in\u00a0 creating new energy sources such as geothermal energy.\nDepending on geothermal properties and local geographical conditions, geothermal energy can be used as a primary power source as well as a substitute for electricity as a source of heat.\nIt is a site-specific renewable energy source that is ideal for meeting the energy needs of remote/interior communities.\nGeothermal heat pump systems use 25% to 50% less electricity than conventional systems for heating or cooling and take up less space for gear.\nMineral byproducts from hot springs, such as silica, borax, and caesium, could be used.\nDemerits\nDespite producing little CO2, geothermal has been linked to other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide.\nInfluences the landscape. Geothermal generating facilities, influence the landscape and causes fractures and minor earthquakes in the areas where they operate.\nIt has a high initial cost to build in a specific location.\nBecause of its activity along the earth\u2019s tectonic plates, it is also referred to as \u201cthe most location-specific energy source known to man.\u201d\nGovernment initiatives\nDraft Geothermal Energy National Policy\nThe scheme\u2019s objective is to establish India as a global leader in geothermal power by deploying 1000 MWth of geothermal energy capacity in the first phase until 2022.\nThe initiative would examine the country\u2019s geothermal resource potential and promote R&D projects for power generation and geo-exchange pumps.\nIndia\u2019s geothermal energy development framework\nIt targets capturing 1,000 MW of geothermal energy by 2022 and 10,000 MW by 2030.\nIt intends to significantly contribute to India\u2019s long-term energy supply and reduce our national greenhouse gas emissions by building a socially and environmentally responsible geothermal energy business that is sustainable, safe, and secure.\nIt aims to encourage international collaboration with world leaders in geothermal energy such as the United States, the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico, and New Zealand in order to accelerate geothermal energy deployment through international investment promotion, customised capacity building, and technical assistance.\nConclusion\n\nAs geothermal discovery is capital-intensive, financial incentives may be announced to encourage geothermal resource exploration.\n\nExploration funding will encourage exploration agencies to pursue geothermal energy projects for power generation and direct heat usage. It will also attract private investors for geothermal energy development. Foreign financing and knowledge transfer, as well as appropriate financial incentives, may be promoted to attract private parties to develop geothermal energy in India.\n\nSo far, research in India has been primarily superficial, leaving a data void for power project design. It is critical in decoding the characteristics of deep reservoirs, which will be valuable in determining the feasibility of resources for power generation.\n\nIf there is strong international cooperation and support from wealthier countries, geothermal energy can help underdeveloped countries tackle climate change while simultaneously boosting living standards.\n\nArticle Written By:\u00a0 Atheena\u00a0 Fathima Riyas\n\n\u00a0",

La Ni\u00f1a is also sometimes called El Viejo, anti-El Ni\u00f1o, or simply \u201ca cold event.\u201d\n\nLa Nina has the opposite effect of El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nDuring La Nina events, trade winds are even stronger than usual, pushing more warm water toward Asia. Off the west coast of the Americas, upwelling increases, bringing cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface.\n\nThese cold waters in the Pacific push the jet stream northward.\n\nThis tends to lead to drought in the southern U.S. and heavy rains and flooding in the Pacific Northwest and Canada.\nDuring a La Nina year, winter temperatures are warmer than normal in the South and cooler than normal in the North.\nLa Ni\u00f1a can also lead to a\u00a0more severe hurricane season.\n\nDuring La Ni\u00f1a, waters off the Pacific coast are colder and contain more nutrients than usual.\n\nThis environment supports more marine life and attracts more cold-water species, like squid and salmon, to places like the California coast.\n\nA neutral state is when neither El Nino nor La Nina is present. During this time the sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific are close to average.\n\nMonitoring El Nino-La Nina Phenomenon\nCourtesy: NOAA\n\nThere are several methods used to predict developments in the Pacific Ocean. Complex dynamical models predict how the tropical Pacific Ocean will change from its current condition.\n\nSome of the precursors to such developments can also be captured by statistical forecasting models.\nAdditional value is added by expert analysis of the current situation, particularly when evaluating the consequences of the changing condition below the ocean\u2019s surface.\nThe consequences of ocean-atmosphere interactions within the climate system are taken into account by all forecasting techniques.\nThe meteorological and oceanographic data that allow El Nino and La Nina episodes to be monitored and forecasted are drawn from national and international observing systems.\n\nThe exchange and processing of the data are carried out under programs coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\n\nThe International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) and WMO work together to produce the WMO El Nino/La Nina Update on a semi-regular basis (about every three months) as a contribution to the United Nations Inter-Agency Task Force on Natural Disaster Reduction.\nIt is based on contributions from top global monitoring and forecasting centers and an expert consensus that WMO and IRI helped to create.\nImpact of El Nino-La Nina on different parts of the world\n\nEl Nino:\n\nOcean temperatures, speed, and power of ocean currents are impacted.\nThe coastal fisheries and local weather of Australia to South America are affected.\nRainfall increases drastically in South America, contributing to coastal flooding and erosion. But causes droughts in Indonesia and Australia.\nEl Nino-related flooding is associated with increases in cholera, dengue, and malaria in some parts of the world, while drought can lead to wildfires that create respiratory problems.\nIt decreases the occurrences of hurricanes in the Atlantic.\nUpwelling on the coasts of Ecuador, Peru, and Chile.\nWeaker monsoons and sometimes drought in India and Southeast Asia.\n\nLa Nina:\n\nMilder winters in northern Europe and colder winters in southern and western Europe around the Mediterranean region.\nIn North America, it causes stronger winds along the equatorial region, hurricanes in the Caribbean and central Atlantic, and more tornados in the US.\nDrought in South America especially in Peru and Ecuador.\nIncreased rainfall in the western pacific eventually affected continental Asia and China.\nHeavy floods in Australia.\nIncreased temperatures in the western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Somalia coasts.\nColder winters in India as it pipes strong cold air from Siberia and forms a north-south low-pressure system.\nLesser impact of western disturbances.\nIndian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and ENSO\n\nIt was observed that a positive IOD index often negated the effect of ENSO, resulting in increased Monsoon rains in several ENSO years like 1983, 1994, and 1997.\n\nIndian Ocean Dipole is a varying ocean-atmosphere system in the Indian Ocean like ENSO in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is defined by the\u00a0difference in sea surface temperature between two areas\u00a0(or poles, hence a dipole), a western pole in the\u00a0Arabian Sea (western Indian Ocean), and an eastern pole in the\u00a0eastern Indian Ocean\u00a0south of Indonesia.\nIOD develops in the equatorial region of the Indian Ocean from April to May peaking in October.\nWith favorable IOD winds over the Indian Ocean blow from east to west (from the Bay of Bengal towards the Arabian Sea). This results in the Arabian Sea (the western Indian Ocean near African Coast) being much warmer and the eastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia becoming colder and dry.\nIn the negative dipole year (negative IOD), the reverse happens to make Indonesia much warmer with increased rainfall.\nPrevious ENSO events\n\nEl Nino:\n\n1982-83 and 1997-98 were very intense events of the 20th century.\n1997-98 was the first scientifically monitored full event.\nThe \u201cyear without a winter\u201d was a time when temperatures in the Midwest broke records for warmth.\n\nLa Nina:\n\nThe 2010 La Nina event correlates with one of the worst floods in the history of Queensland, Australia.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Are you aware of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation? Read further to know more.\n\nThe extensive, interconnected network of water currents in the oceans is known as ocean circulation.\n\nIt includes both surface and deep currents.\n\nAtlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is one such example of ocean circulation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)?\nWhat is thermohaline circulation?\nWorking of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\nSignificance of AMOC\nIs the AMOC slowing down?\nConsequences of a slowing AMOC?\nImpact of the Indian Ocean\nWhat is Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)?\n\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a major ocean current system that transports warm surface waters from the tropics toward the northern Atlantic and colder deep waters that are part of the\u00a0thermohaline circulation, southward. One of the main ways the ocean circulates heat, salt, carbon, and nutrients throughout the world\u2019s oceans is through overturning circulation.\n\nNow you might be wondering what is thermohaline circulation. Let us quickly look into it and come back to AMOC.\n\nWhat is thermohaline circulation?\n\nThe thermohaline circulation, also known as the ocean\u2019s conveyor belt, is part of the ocean circulation and is powered by temperature and salinity differences causing density differences. These are deep ocean currents occurring thousands of meters below the sea surface.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt leads to intermixing of salt and heat. Thus, it effectively describes a driving mechanism.\n\nNow let us come back to Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. We shall discuss in detail the working of AMOC.\n\nWorking of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\nThe Atlantic Ocean\u2019s warm water cools as it travels north, and evaporation raises its salt content.\nThe water sinks deep into the ocean due to its increased density brought on by a combination of a low temperature and a high salt content.\nDeep below, the chilly, dense water steadily moves southward.\nIt eventually returns to the surface, warms up once more, and the circulation is complete.\n\nSignificance of AMOC\nAMOC helps to disperse heat and energy throughout the earth (heat budget).\nBecause of AMOC, the climate in Western Europe is less severe even during the winter (Gulf Stream, North Atlantic Drift).\nBy absorbing and storing carbon from the atmosphere, it serves as a carbon sink.\nCarbon sequestration by AMOC has profound effects on how anthropogenic global warming develops.\nThe distribution of heat to the polar regions is largely dependent on thermohaline circulation. As a result, it impacts how quickly sea ice forms at the poles, which in turn affects other components of the climate system (such as the albedo, and thus solar heating, at high latitudes)\nIs the AMOC slowing down?\n\nAccording to the\u00a0IPCC\u2019s Report\u00a0(AR6), it is very likely that AMOC will decline over the 21st century.\n\nThis is due to the fact that as the atmosphere heats, the surface ocean below it holds onto more heat. Meanwhile, the ocean\u00a0gets fresher due to increases in rainfall and ice melt. All of these modifications lighten the ocean water, which lessens the sinking in the \u201cconveyor belt\u201d.\n\nThis results in a weaker AMOC. The AMOC will therefore most certainly diminish. But it is quite improbable that it would undergo the kind of huge, abrupt shifts in the 21st century as have been\u00a0observed in the past.\n\nConsequences of a slowing AMOC?\n\nSlowing down of the AMOC would have the following consequences:\n\nFurther decline in marine productivity in the North Atlantic (less sinking will result in less mixing of water)\nAn increase in regional sea level along the northeast coast of North America\nMore storms in Northern Europe\nA decrease in Sahelian summer rainfall\nDecrease in South Asian summer rainfall.\nImpact of the Indian Ocean\n\nOne of the footprints of global warming is the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean produces more precipitation as it warms up more quickly. More air, particularly air from the Atlantic, is drawn to the Indian Ocean as a result.\n\nThere will be less precipitation in the Atlantic Ocean due to the Indian Ocean receiving so much precipitation. Higher salinity in the tropical Atlantic Ocean waters will result from less precipitation.\n\nAs it travels north through the AMOC, this saltier water will cool considerably more quickly than usual and sink more quickly. However, it\u2019s unclear how long the Indian Ocean\u2019s increased heat will last, according to scientists.\n\nThe advantage for AMOC will end if warming in other tropical oceans, particularly the Pacific, catches up with that in the Indian Ocean.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline Abraham",

    "[CONTENT] #360": "The geography of India is extremely diverse, with landscapes ranging from snow-capped mountain ranges to deserts, plains, hills and plateaus. In the southern part of Peninsular India, there is a flood basalt province named the Deccan traps. Read more about the Deccan traps here.\n\nThe name Deccan is derived from the Sanskrit word \u2018d\u00e2kshin\u2019, meaning \u201csouth.\u201d\n\nThe west-central parts of the Indian peninsula are dominated by flood basalts which form a prominent terraced landscape.\n\nFlood Basalt volcanoes out-pour highly fluid lava that flows for long distances to form larger flood basalt province\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Deccan Traps?\nDistribution of Deccan Traps:\nHow are Deccan traps formed?\nCharacteristics of Deccan Trap:\nPetrology of Deccan Traps:\nClassification of Deccan Traps:\nLife of Deccan Traps:\nAge of Deccan Traps:\nBlack Soil/ Regur Soil/ Cotton Soil:\nDistribution of Black Soil:\nCharacteristics of Black Soil:\nContents of Black Soil:\nWhat are Deccan Traps?\n\nA thick succession of (3200 metres) late Cretaceous basaltic lava flows known as the Deccan Traps covers around 500 000 square kilometres of peninsular India. This basaltic lava soil has gradually eroded due to erosion, resulting in the formation of a Deccan trap.\n\nThe Deccan Traps is an area of black dirt on the Peninsular Plateau. The rocks are igneous and have volcanic origins. Black dirt has been produced as a result of the erosion of these rocks over time.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDistribution of Deccan Traps:\n\nThe majority of these volcanic rocks are found in Gujarat\u2019s Kutch and Kathiawar regions, as well as in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra.\n\nIts thickness varies depending on whether the surface is flat or sloppy, being midway between deep and shallow.\n\nThese (the Deccan Traps) might be considered Peninsular India\u2019s most widespread geological formations after the Archean Rocks.\n\nHow are Deccan traps formed?\n\nCretaceous vulcanicity, the development of many linear cracks in the earth\u2019s crust, is what causes the formation of decan traps. This eruption did not produce any volcanic domes since it was of the quiet kind.\n\nThis incident started 66.25 million years ago (End of the Cretaceous period) when India was near present placed Madagascar and during its movement north, it passed over Reunion Hotspot. Presently this hotspot is dormant in nature.\n\nFrom a general study of the Deccan Traps, the following broad conclusions can be drawn about their mode of eruption:\n\n(a) They erupted in a sub-aerial environment. Their relationship with the older rocks suggests this.\n\n(b) Eruptions of the lava took place along linear fissures, forming fissure-type of eruptions and not from any central cone-type volcanoes. This is explained by numerous flows and their remarkably consistent horizontal attitude.\n\n(c) The lava when erupted was in a highly liquid form, which is indicated by the long distances over which the individual flows could spread. This fact also suggests that the lava might have been super-heated to reach that state of mobility.\n\n(d) A large number of dykes that have been found occurring intersecting many lava flows might be quite younger than those flows, but some such dykes might have also been the feeder dykes for the volcanic eruptions.\n\n(e) The lava flows, especially after the beginning and before the close of the activity, passed through definite periods of no volcanic activity. During such periods streams and lakes appeared on the cooled and congealed volcanic landforms here and there and both animal and plant life domiciled these areas. This is indicated by the occurrence of inter-trappean layers found in the lower and upper flows and their fossil contents.\n\nCharacteristics of Deccan Trap:\nIt is frequently referred to as regur soil or black dirt. Due to their high clay content.\nthey get sticky when wet and are therefore challenging to plough.\nThey develop in semi-arid regions that are coated with basalt.\nThe soil is almost devoid of humus and is black due to the presence of titanium salt in the lava land that makes up the Deccan trap. They have a lot of lime in them.\nParticularly in the lowlands and river valleys where it is deep and clayey, the soil holds moisture well and is extremely productive.\nThe construction of traps is very constant and regular; they are layered and the strata are practically horizontal everywhere, with an average dip (angle of inclination) of 5\u00b0\u201310\u00b0. This is similar to a homogenous mineralogical and chemical composition.\nThe thickness of the individual strata, known as lava flows, can range from 3 metres to 30 metres or even more.\nThe area of the flows is frequently much larger than the layer thickness, sometimes even reaching 100 km.\nThe Inter-Trappean Beds, which are non-volcanic sedimentary levels, frequently interrupt the consecutive flows. These show deposits in rivers and lakes with shallow water that developed during the lulls in the age\u2019s volcanic activity.\nThere are several excellent fossils of animals and plants that may have survived during those times when there was no volcanic activity to be found in the inter-trappean strata. The age of the Traps has been interpreted using these fossils.\nPetrology of Deccan Traps:\n\nThe most significant rock in the Deccan Trap is augite-basalt basalt, which has a greyish-green colour. Vesicular and amygdaloidal textures are frequently seen. There have also been discoveries of intrusions formed by basic volcanic rocks like gabbro and limburgite as well as acidic volcanic rocks like rhyolites and granophyres in places like Kutch and Bombay.\n\nTrap basalts are shown by microscopic investigation to be fine-grained basalts that are surprisingly devoid of olivine. While calcite, quartz, glauconite, etc. are some of the typical accessory minerals that frequently fill the voids in the original basalts, augite and felspars are the principal ingredients.\n\nClassification of Deccan Traps:\n\nThe Traps have been classified into three groups namely, Upper Traps, Middle Traps and Lower Traps.\n\nLife of Deccan Traps:\n\nIn the lower and upper divisions of the Traps, fossilised remains of several animals and plants have been discovered in the inter-trappean deposits.\n\nThe primary constituents of the Inter-Trappean beds include eroded volcanic debris, clay, impure limestones, and other related materials. Many locations in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra have investigated these beds.\n\nThe inter-trappean beds, which are composed of dark-shaded shales, may be found in fine arts in the Malabar Hills of Bombay.\n\nCerithium, Potamides, Hydraspis, Rana, and Paudina, all of which are freshwater or estuary environment species, are among the fossils produced by Inter-trappean deposits. From Deccan Traps, no marine life fossils have been found.\n\nAge of Deccan Traps:\n\nOn the precise geological age of the Deccan Traps, there is still no widespread consensus. There have been two potential placements.\n\nThe Deccan Traps should be compared to the Danian Stage of the Upper Cretaceous based on stratigraphic data. The second theory, which mostly relies on fossil data, contends that a Lower Eocene age is more acceptable.\n\nThe discovery of certain typical fish and palm fossils from the Tertiary system lends weight to this. However, it can be generally concluded that the activity that led to the deposition of the Deccan Traps began somewhere in the Upper Cretaceous and continued through the era change right up until and even into the Lower Eocene period of Tertiary times, given the enormous thickness of the Traps (more than 2000 m at some locations).\n\nBlack Soil/ Regur Soil/ Cotton Soil:\n\nBlack Soil, commonly referred to as \u201cRegur Soil,\u201d is dark soil. It is also known as \u201ccotton soil\u201d since it is ideal for producing cotton.\n\nThese lava flow-derived soils, which cover the north-western Deccan plateau and are most typical of the Deccan trap (Basalt) area, are widespread.\n\nBlack soil is thought to have formed as a result of a combination of environmental causes and parent rock composition.\n\nDistribution of Black Soil:\n\nParticularly in the locations where basalt is present, black soil grows in semi-arid environments. They extend eastward in the south along the Godavari River and Krishna River Valleys, covering the plateaus of Maharashtra, Saurashtra, Malwa, and southern Madhya Pradesh.\n\nUnder the necessary semi-arid climatic conditions, granites and gneisses with iron content also generate black soil in Tamil Nadu\u2019s southern area.\n\nThe districts of Surat and Bharuch, as well as the Narmada Valley and Tapti Valley, all produce black soil.\nThe soil in these areas has essentially little humus, and the black colour of the soil is caused by the presence of certain salts. Black soils are often thin, deficient, and sandy in the mountainous portion of the nation.\n\nCharacteristics of Black Soil:\n\nBlack soils are very sensitive. Due to their high clay content, black soils become sticky when wet and are therefore challenging to plough. They have a reputation for holding onto moisture. In the field, the heat causes thick cracks to form. This aids in their ventilation, which accounts for their dominance in self-ploughing. After the initial or pre-monsoon rainfall, this soil becomes sticky and impossible to work unless it is immediately tilled.\n\nContents of Black Soil:\n\nLime is abundant in black soils and Regur soils. In nature, it is rich soil made up of a combination of sand, clay, and organic components. Additionally, this soil is quite productive and moisture-retentive, especially on the plains and in river valleys where it is deep and clayey.\n\nAdditionally, they are rich in soil nutrients including potash, calcium carbonate, and magnesium carbonate. However, the Black or Regur soil does not contain enough nitrogen, which is thought to be important for plant development.\n\nThe soil in the Deccan Trap is nearly devoid of humus and exhibits a dark black hue as a result of the presence of titanium salt. They contain a lot of lime.\n\nThe lowlands and river valleys, where the soil is deep and clayey, as well as the slopes and high hills, have exceptionally fertile soil that retains moisture well. These soils are often poor, thin, and sandy. These soils are deficient in phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen, all of which are crucial for the establishment of dense plants and grain crops, respectively.\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed",

Read here to know in detail about the Rossby waves.\n\nCarl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby, an American meteorologist of Swedish descent, made the initial discovery of Rossby waves in 1939.\n\nAccording to scientists, Rossby waves are a naturally occurring phenomenon like La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o. These waves have been responsible for some extreme weather events in recent times.\n\nIn recent years, many changes and extreme weather events have been observed all over the globe-\n\nExtreme floods are devastating Pakistan, caused by a combination of heavy monsoon rains and melting glaciers.\nWestern Europe\u00a0and\u00a0central and eastern China\u00a0have experienced record-breaking heatwaves and droughts leading to water restrictions.\nSevere downpours have caused floods in places ranging from\u00a0Dallas in the United States\u00a0to\u00a0Seoul in South Korea, which experienced its heaviest torrential rain in a century.\nRecord-breaking heat extremes have also been recorded in Japan, the central US, and the UK, where temperatures exceeded 40\u2103 for the first time.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Rossby waves?\nTypes:\nOceanic waves\nAtmospheric waves\nPoleward propagating atmospheric/ Topographic waves\nDifference between jet streams and Rossby waves:\nSignificance of Rossby waves\nThe twin cyclones:\nWhat are Rossby waves?\n\nRossby waves are a type of inertial wave and are also referred to as a planetary waves.

These waves are related to the jet stream and pressure systems.\n\nOceanic Rossby waves travel along the thermocline, which separates the warm surface layer from the colder, deeper ocean.\n\nWhen air from the polar area moves towards the Equator while air from the tropics moves towards the poles, these waves are created.\n\nHeat tends to flow from high low to high latitudes due to variations in the solar radiation received.\n\nThe operation of high-pressure cells and low-pressure cells like cyclones, which are crucial in generating the weather of middle and higher latitudes is explained by the existence of waves.\n\nA true Rossby wave needs to meet some specific criteria. For one thing, these waves only occur inside\u00a0barotropic fluids, a category of fluids whose densities are a function of pressure alone\n\nTypes:\nOceanic Rossby waves\nAtmospheric Rossby waves\nPoleward propagating atmospheric/ Topographic Rossby waves\nOceanic waves\n\nUnlike waves that break along the shore, Rossby waves are huge, surging movements of the ocean that\u00a0stretch horizontally across the planet for hundreds of kilometers in a westward direction.\n\nThey are so large and massive that they can change Earth\u2019s climate conditions.\n\nAlong with\u00a0rising sea levels,\u00a0King Tides, and the effects of\u00a0El Ni\u00f1o, oceanic Rossby waves contribute to high tides and coastal flooding in some regions of the world.\nAtmospheric waves\n\nAtmospheric Rossby waves form primarily as a result of the Earth\u2019s geography.\n\nRossby waves help transfer heat from the tropics toward the poles and cold air toward the tropics in an attempt to return the atmosphere to balance.\n\nThey also help locate the jet stream and mark out the track of surface low-pressure systems.\n\nThe slow motion of these waves often results in long, persistent weather patterns.\n\nThey are influenced by Coriolis force and pressure gradient.\n\nThe rotation causes fluids to turn to the right as they move in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere.\n\nPoleward propagating atmospheric/ Topographic waves\n\nOver extremely warm sea surfaces in the tropics, such as during El Nio episodes, deep convection (heat transfer to the troposphere) is intensified.\n\nRossby waves in the atmosphere are produced as a result of this tropical force, and they migrate both eastward and poleward.\n\nThe waves explain the statistical connections between low and high-latitude climates.\n\nDifference between jet streams and Rossby waves:\n\nThe major difference between these is their circulation or movement pattern-\n\nA jet stream is a circulation of fast-moving air that is thousands of miles away and is not very dense.\nWhile Rossby is the name given to the swirling or meandering motion of the jet stream.\nSignificance of Rossby waves\n\nRossby waves are a dominant component of Ferrel circulation.\n\nThe tropical air carries heat poleward, and the polar air absorbs heat as it moves toward the Equator.\n\nThe existence of these waves explains the low-pressure cells (cyclones) and high-pressure cells (anticyclones) that are important in producing the\u00a0weather\u00a0of the middle and higher latitudes.\n\nSun and other planets like Venus and Jupiter have these waves in their atmosphere as well.\n\nSolar Rossby waves were first observed in the movement of magnetic structures in the solar corona.\nBy studying the sun\u2019s Rossby waves, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of environmental changes known as \u201cspace weather,\u201d which affects everything from TV broadcasts and power grids to GPS systems and military satellites.\n\nThese waves have been suggested as an important mechanism responsible for the heating of the ocean on Europa, a moon of Jupiter.\n\nRossby wave instabilities\u00a0are also thought to be found in astrophysical\u00a0discs, for example, around newly forming stars.\n\nThe twin cyclones:\n\nThe interplay of the wind and the monsoon system combined with the Earth system produces these synchronous cyclones which are caused by equatorial Rossby waves.\n\nThis system has a vortex in the northern hemisphere and another in the southern hemisphere, and each of these is a mirror image of the other.\nThe vortex in the north spins counterclockwise and has a positive spin, while the one in the southern hemisphere spins in the clockwise direction and therefore has a negative spin.\nBoth have a positive value of the vorticity which is a measure of the rotation.\nVery often twin cyclones are formed from these Rossby waves.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

    "[CONTENT] #366": "We have often heard about cloudburst occurrences in states like Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. It causes the widespread destruction of both human and material resources. What is the cause of cloudbursts? How is it different from rainfall? Read to know more.\n\nNatural disasters are associated with the negative impacts of a natural hazard.\n\nShort spells of very heavy rainfall over a small geographical area can cause widespread destruction, especially in hilly regions.\n\nNot all instances of very heavy rainfall, however, are cloudbursts. To understand the difference let us dive deep into the topic.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are cloudbursts?\nAtmospheric changes during the occurrence of a cloudburst\nHow common are they?\nConsequences of a heavy downpour\nCan we forecast sudden rains?\nCloudbursts and climate change: Are cloudburst events increasing?\nWhat are cloudbursts?\n\nA cloudburst is a localized but intense rainfall activity. It has a very specific definition: Rainfall of 10 cm or more in an hour over a roughly 10 km x 10 km area is classified as a cloudburst event. By this definition, 5 cm of rainfall in a half-hour period over the same area can also be categorized as a cloudburst. From this, it is clear that cloudbursts are different from rainfall.\n\nAtmospheric changes during the occurrence of a cloudburst\nCloudbursts happen when drenched clouds are not able to cause rain because of the rising movement of the extremely hot current of air. Rather than falling down, raindrops get larger in dimension and are forced up because of the air current.\nThe relative humidity and cloud cover is at the maximum level with low temperature and slow winds because of which a huge mass of clouds may get condensed at a very rapid rate and result in a cloudburst.\nAs temperatures increase, the atmosphere can hold more and more moisture. This moisture comes down as a short, very intense rainfall, probably in half an hour or one hour.\nHow common are they?\n\nCloudbursts are not uncommon events, particularly during the monsoon months. Most of these happen in the Himalayan states where the local topology, wind systems, and temperature gradients between the lower and upper atmosphere facilitate the occurrence of such events. Some of the recent instances of cloudbursts are:\n\nOn December 2nd, 2015, Chennai recorded 494 mm rainfall causing the 2015 South India floods.\nOn May 4th, 2018, a cloudburst occurred above Belagavi, Karnataka. It reported 95mm of rain in an hour.\nOn October 20th, 2021, it occurred in the Salem district of Tamil Nadu. It recorded 213 mm of rain in one day. The Vasishta river flooded due to this.\nConsequences of a heavy downpour\nIt can result in flash floods in mountainous areas and urban floods in the cities.\nCan lead to mudflows, landslides and land caving.\nLoss of lives of humans and animals.\nLoss of buildings and property damage.\nLoss of forests and wild flora and fauna.\nCan we forecast sudden rains?\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts rainfall events well in advance, but it does not predict the quantum of rainfall. The forecasts can be about light, heavy, or very heavy rainfall. But weather scientists do not have the capability to predict exactly how much rain is likely to fall at any given place.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAdditionally, the forecasts are for a relatively large geographical area, usually a region, a state, a meteorological sub-division, or at best a district. As they zoom in over smaller areas, the forecasts get more and more uncertain. Theoretically, it is not impossible to forecast rainfall over a very small area as well, but it requires a very dense network of weather instruments and computing capabilities that seem unfeasible with current technologies.\n\nAs a result, specific cloudburst events cannot be forecast. No forecast ever mentions a possibility of a cloudburst. But there are warnings for heavy to very heavy rainfall events, and these are routinely forecast four to five days in advance. The possibility of extremely heavy rainfall is forecast six to 12 hours in advance.\n\nCloudbursts and climate change: Are cloudburst events increasing?\n\nThere is no definitive evidence that suggests that cloudbursts are increasing due to climate change. However, as we have been witnessing, the intensity of heavy rainfall occurrences in a short spell of time has been increasing. That means that the wet spells are very wet, and are interspersed with prolonged dry spells even in the rainy season.\n\nThis kind of pattern, attributed to climate change, does suggest that cloudburst events might also be on the rise.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline Abraham",

In this ecosystem, the vegetation is dominated by herbs and grass.\n\nThese ecosystems are mainly found in regions, where there is a scarcity of water and not enough regular rainfall to support the growth of plants and forests.\n\nThe grassland ecosystem lies between the deserts and the forest ecosystems.\n\nSavanna grasslands and temperate grasslands are some examples of grassland ecosystems.\u00a0\n\nGrasslands are one of the intermediate stages in ecological succession and cover a part of the land at all altitudes and latitudes at which climatic and soil conditions do not allow the growth of trees.\n\nThis ecosystem makes up almost a quarter of the total land surface and covers areas where rainfall is usually low and/or the soil depth and quality are poor.\n\nThe low rainfall prevents the growth of numerous trees and shrubs but is sufficient to support the growth of grass cover during the monsoon.\n\nWhere grasslands are found?\n\nGrassland occurs where there is sufficient moisture for grass growth, but where environmental conditions, both climatic and anthropogenic prevent tree growth.\n\nIts occurrence, therefore, correlates with a rainfall intensity between that of desert and forest and is extended by grazing or fire to form a plagioclimax in many areas that were previously forested.\n\nThese ecosystems are particularly fragile because water is scarce.\n\nTypes of Grasslands:\n\nAs climate plays an important role in the formation of grasslands, it is generally used as a basis to divide the world\u2019s grasslands into two broad categories: those that occur in the temperate region and those that occur in the tropical regions.\n\nTROPICAL GRASSLAND\tTEMPERATE GRASSLAND\n\nThese occur on either side of the equator and extend to the tropics\n\t\nFound in the mid-latitudinal zones and in the interior part of the continent\n\n\nDry and wet seasons that remain warm all the time\u00a0\nReceive 50-130cm rainfall\u00a0\n\t\nCold

communities.\nPerennial natural grasses are the most common species.\n\t\nNorthern portions of Gujarat, Rajasthan (excluding the Aravallis), Western Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Punjab.\n\n\nDry Sub-Humid Zone\n\t\nThe biodiversity of dry sub-humid regions is well adapted to the difficult conditions characterized by unpredictable rainfall patterns that result in droughts and floods, as well as high temperatures in many cases.\nMany of the world\u2019s crops, such as wheat, barley, and olives, are grown in dry and sub-humid environments.\n\t\nIn India, this zone encompasses all of peninsular India (except Nilgiri).\n\n\nMoist Sub Humid Zone\n\t\nThe moist sub-humid zone describes areas where the climate is intermediate between semi-arid and humid, and the precipitation supports the dense development of tall or short grasses but not forests.\n\t\nIt includes the Ganga alluvial plain in Northern India, and the landscape is flat, low-lying, and poorly drained.\n\n\nHumid Montane Regions\n\t\nHumid montane grasslands are grasslands and shrublands found at high elevations around the world.\nThe term \u201cmontane\u201d in the biome\u2019s name denotes \u201chigh altitude\u201d.\nThe savanna is derived from humid forests due to shifting cultivation and sheep grazing\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nAssam, Manipur, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir\u2019s humid montane regions and moist sub-humid zones.\n\nIn India, grasslands are found as village grazing grounds (Gauchar) and extensive low pastures in dry regions of the western part of the country and also in the Alpine Himalayas. Perennial grasses are the dominant plant community seen here.\n\nIn the Himalayan mountains, there are high, cold Himalayan pastures. There are tracts of tall elephant grass in the low-lying Terai belt south of the Himalayan foothills.\n\nThere are semi-arid grasslands in Western India, parts of Central India, and the Deccan Plateau. Patches of shola grasslands occur on hill slopes alongside the extremely moist evergreen forests in South India.\n\nEconomic Importance of grasslands:\nWheat, corn, and rice are the three main plants that are grown on grasslands all over the world.\nFarmers who keep cattle or goats, as well as shepherds who keep sheep, are highly dependent on grasslands. It provides a significant food source for cows and sheep.\nDomestic animals are grazed in the \u2018common\u2019 land of the village.\nThey are the grazing areas of many rural communities.\nWater from semi-natural grasslands is currently in short supply.\nThese natural grasslands create an efficient system for water absorption, high infiltration, and reduced erosion.\nGrassland/pasture can sustain plants that honey bees have a long relationship with (clovers and other non-native weeds). Grasslands have diverse species of insects that pollinate crops.\nThere are also predators of these insects such as small mammals like shrews, reptiles like lizards, birds of prey, and amphibia such as frogs and toads.\nAll these carnivorous animals help to control insect pests in adjoining agricultural lands.\nThe grass is also used to thatch houses and farm sheds.\nGrasslands, both natural and semi-natural, play a significant role in the cultural landscape.\nSome grasslands are designated as nature reserves or national parks, and they are frequently promoted as tourist destinations both locally and nationally.\nThe thorny bushes and branches of the few trees that are seen in grasslands are used as a major source of fuelwood.\nLocally, however, stakeholders, including regional specialists and local farmers, recognize their importance.\nFlora and Fauna of the ecosystem:\nGrasses are the dominating plants, with scattered drought-resistant thorny trees in the tropical grasslands.\nBadgers, foxes, asses, zebra, and antelope are found grazing on grasslands that support the dairy and leather industries.\nGrasslands also support the large population of rodents, reptiles and insects.\nIn some regions, grasslands also support a variety of other herbaceous plants like sedges, legumes and members of the sunflower family. Grasslands support numerous herbivores, from minute insects to very large mammals.\u00a0\nRats, mice, rodents, deer, elephants, dogs, buffalo, tigers, lions, and ferrets are some common mammals in grasslands.\u00a0\nIn northeast India, the one-horned rhinoceros is among the threatened animal of grassland in this region.\u00a0\nA large number of avian fauna seen\nCharacteristics features of this ecosystem:\nShort plants: Grasslands normally have a very short growing season as the climate is dry and the soil is poor. This condition inhibits the growth of woody and large trees and favours the growth of small plants like grass and shrubs.\nFast-growing grass: Grasses have a tendency to grow back in spite of grazing or overgrazing. Moreover, most grass species can grow quickly after a fire has swept through the grassland and some have seeds that can grow after being burned in a fire.\nMostly hot and Dry Areas: Nearly all large grasslands are hot, at least in summer and dry. In general tropical grasslands receive 500 to 1500 mm of about 15 to 35 degrees.\nChange in appearance: These ecosystems change their appearance throughout the year. While in winter grasslands look drab and lifeless. A similar change can be seen in tropical grasslands where the onset of the rainy season changes the landscape from dull brown to bright green.\nGrassland also performs Energy flow through the food chain, Nutrient cycling (biogeochemical cycles).\nEcological succession or ecosystem development.\nHomeostasis (or cybernetic) or feedback control mechanisms.\nTo increase the fertility of the soil and regulate the productivity of the ecosystem.\nTo reduce the leaching of minerals due to low rainfall.\nConclusion:\n\nThe grasslands are one of the most important landforms. They assist agriculture by providing essential ecosystem services such as water and climate regulation, as well as biogeochemical cycling, carbon storage, cultural, and recreational benefits. They are also the major reservoirs of agricultural gene pools, and many of the crops that enable human life, such as wheat, corn, rice, and millet, originated in these ecosystems. Grasslands are also important habitats for a variety of flora and animals.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

It promoted capitalist farming as big land owners profited the most.\nIndustrialization: The large-scale mechanization of farms created a demand for machinery like tractors, harvesters, threshers, combines, diesel engines, electric motors, pumping sets, etc. Demand for chemical fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, weedicides, etc. also increased considerably.\nAgro industries: Several agricultural products came to be used as raw materials in various industries giving rise to agro-based industries.\nEmployment: The demand for labor force increased rural employment, and the industrial workforce at the same time.\nNegative effects\n\nImpact on ecology\n\nIndigenous seeds did not have the inherent ability to withstand the chemical fertilizers used hence they started dying out of usage.\nThe newly introduced high-yielding seeds had a narrow genetic base compared to the indigenous species.\nThe overuse of chemical fertilizers to get high yield caused physical and chemical degradation of the soil by altering the natural microflora and increasing the alkalinity and salinity of the soil.\n\nImpact on other food crops\n\nNon-food grains were not included- major commercial crops like cotton, jute, tea, and sugarcane were also left almost untouched by the Green Revolution.\nThe High Yielding Variety Programme (HYVP) was restricted to only five crops: Wheat, Rice, Jowar, Bajra, and Maize.\nThe green revolution impacted only a few states creating economic disparity among regions.\n\nImpact on farmers\n\nThe excessive use of groundwater for irrigation depleted the water table in many parts of the country.\nEventually, small farmers sold their lands to large commercial farmers as they were unable to withstand the increasing expenses of farming and debts.\nMany farmers left farming unable to withstand the food inflation and economic crisis.\n\nImpact on food consumption and nutrition\n\nThe per capita net availability of other cereal grains such as millets and pulses decreased over the years.\nThis led to the change in the consumption pattern over the years and the shift in focus from the minor cereals and pulses to the major cereals, rice and wheat.\nThe consumption of major cereals such as rice and wheat along with pulses and a decrease in the addition of coarse cereals, foods of animal origin, and fruits and vegetables in the diet lead to a deficiency of micronutrients such as iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin A, folate, and riboflavin among the population causing anemia, keratomalacia, blindness, and infertility in severe cases.\nGreen Revolution \u2013 Krishonnati Yojana\n\nThe government of India introduced the\u00a0Green Revolution Krishonnati Yojana\u00a0in 2005 to boost the agriculture sector.\n\nThe government through the scheme plans to develop the agriculture and allied sector in a holistic & scientific manner to increase the income of farmers.\n\nIt comprises 11 schemes and missions under a single umbrella scheme:\n\nMission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH)\nNational Food Security Mission (NFSM)\nNational Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)\nSubmission on Agriculture Extension (SMAE)\nSub-Mission on Seeds and Planting Material (SMSP)\nSub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM)\nSub-Mission on Plant Protection and Plan Quarantine (SMPPQ)\nIntegrated Scheme on Agriculture Census, Economics, and Statistics (ISACES)\nIntegrated Scheme on Agricultural Cooperation (ISAC)\nIntegrated Scheme on Agricultural Marketing (ISAM)\nNational e-Governance Plan in Agriculture (NeGP-A)\nConclusion\n\nThe green revolution pulled India out of a major food crisis and provided unprecedented food security. The success story helped the country achieve self-sufficiency and even an export market of food grains.\n\nBut the negative impacts on the environment and lack of knowledge on heavy-duty chemical fertilizers among Indian farmers weren\u2019t taken into account, which led to failures towards the end of it.\n\nThe advantages of indigenous crops should be realized and they should be revived as food security must also ensure the nutrition security of the nation.\n\nProper planning and intensive collaborative research work should be initiated by the stakeholders for the conservation of the traditional varieties and the inclusion of these varieties and practices into the food and nutrition security plans for the nation owing to their nutritional benefits.\n\nThe impact on ecology and the water table must be specially focused upon.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nGenetically Modified Crops and Regulations in India\nGreen Agriculture",

    "[CONTENT] #378": "Irrigation systems are an integral part of agriculture. There are numerous types of irrigation systems aiding the growth of agriculture. Read here to know more.\n\nAgriculture is the key to the development of human civilization and the nerve of the economic well-being of any country. Irrigation systems are a major process aiding agriculture for centuries.\n\nAncient civilizations in many parts of the world practiced irrigation. Civilization would probably not be possible without some form of irrigation.\n\nThe earliest form of\u00a0irrigation\u00a0probably involved people carrying buckets of water from wells or rivers to pour on their\u00a0crops. As better techniques developed, societies in Egypt and China built\u00a0irrigation\u00a0canals,\u00a0dams,\u00a0dikes, and water\u00a0storage\u00a0facilities.\n\nAncient Rome built structures called\u00a0aqueducts\u00a0to carry water from\u00a0snowmelt\u00a0in the Alps to cities and towns in the valleys below. This water was used for drinking, washing, and\u00a0irrigation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIrrigation system\nTypes\nSurface irrigation\nSprinkler Irrigation\nWell and tube\nCanal irrigation\nTank\nDrip irrigation\nSurge irrigation\nDitch irrigation\nSub-irrigation\nChallenges faced by agriculture\nGovernment initiatives for irrigation system\nWay forward\nIrrigation system\n\nIrrigation is the artificial application of water to the soil or agricultural field. It is like supplementing rainwater with another source of water. It is mostly used in dry areas and during periods of insufficient rainfall.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe main idea behind these systems is to assist in the growth of crops and plants by maintaining the minimum amount of water required, suppressing weed growth in fields, and preventing soil consolidation.\n\nIt is considered a basic infrastructure and vital input required for agricultural production. The major aim is to maintain the agricultural output with a minimum amount of water, maintenance of landscapes, and re-vegetation of disturbed soils.\n\nThese systems are also used for dust repression, removal of sewage, and mining. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given region.\n\nIt also has effects on crop production, which include:\n\nProtecting plants against frost\nSuppressing weed growth in a grain field\nPreventing soil consolidation.\nfor dust suppression,\nDisposal of sewage, and mining.\nTypes\n\nThe three basic and broad classifications of methods are:\n\nSurface\nSprinkler\nSub-surface\nSurface irrigation\n\nIn this technique, water flows and spreads over the surface of the land. Varied quantities of water are allowed on the fields at different times.\n\nSurface irrigation technique is broadly classified as basin irrigation; border irrigation; furrow irrigation and uncontrolled flooding.\n\nBasin Irrigation\n\nThe Basin system is suitable for many field crops. Paddy rice grows best when its roots are submerged in water, so basin irrigation is the best method for this crop.\nIt is generally not suited to crops that cannot stand in wet or waterlogged conditions for periods longer than 24 hours.\nThese are usually root and tuber crops such as potatoes, cassava, beet, and carrots which require loose, well-drained soils.\n\nFurrow irrigation\n\nIn the furrow technique, trenches or \u201cfurrows\u201d are dug between crop rows in a field.\nFarmers flow water down the furrows (often using only gravity) and it seeps vertically and horizontally to refill the soil reservoir. Flow to each furrow is individually controlled.\nThe Furrow technique is suitable for row crops, and tree crops, and because water does not directly contact the plants, crops that would be damaged by direct inundation by water such as tomatoes, vegetables, potatoes, and beans.\nIt is one of the oldest systems of irrigation.\n\nBorder irrigation\n\nBorder irrigation is a type of surface irrigation where the field is divided into strips separated by border ridges running down the gradient of the field.\nThe area between the ridges is flooded during irrigation.\nIt can be viewed as an extension of basin irrigation to include long rectangular or contoured field shapes.\n\nUncontrolled flooding\n\nIn uncontrolled flooding, the water is spread or flooded into the field without control of water and preparation of land.\nIt is also called wild flooding.\nThe efficiency of this method depends upon the depth of flooding, the size of the stream, the rate of intake of water into the soil, and the topography of the field.\nThis method is suitable for inundation irrigation systems, pastures & forage crops and is inexpensive.\nSprinkler Irrigation\nIn this method, water is sprayed into the air and allowed to fall on the ground surface somewhat resembling rainfall.\nThe flow of water develops the spray under pressure through small orifices or nozzles.\nThe sprinkler irrigation system is a very suitable method for irrigation on uneven lands and shallow soils.\nNearly all crops are suitable for sprinkler irrigation systems except crops like paddy, jute, etc. The dry crops, vegetables, flowering crops, orchards, and plantation crops like tea, and coffee are all suitable and can be irrigated through sprinklers.\nWell and tube\nWell, and Tube Well irrigation is the most popular irrigation system in India.\nThe first tube well was dug in 1930 in Uttar Pradesh. Today more than 50 lakh tube wells are operating in different parts of India.\nIt has contributed substantially to the success of the Green Revolution in India. Uttar Pradesh has the largest area under good irrigation.\nIt is followed by Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Bihar.\nThere are various types of wells \u2013 shallow wells, deep wells, tube wells, artesian wells, etc. From the shallow wells water is not always available as the level of water goes down during the dry months.\nDeep wells are more suitable for irrigation as water from them is available throughout the year.\nCanal irrigation\nCanal irrigation is one of the most important sources of irrigation. It accounts for about 24% of the total irrigation in the nation.\nIt is an effective source of irrigation in low-level relief, deep fertile soil, and perennial river areas which are mostly found in the northern plains.\nThere are two types of canal systems: Inundation and Perennial canals.\nInundation canals are taken out from the rivers without any regulating system and provide irrigation mainly in the rainy season when the river is in flood and there is excess water.\nPerennial Canals\u00a0are those which are taken off from perennial rivers by constructing a barrage across the river. Most of the canals in India are perennial.\nMost of the canals provide perennial irrigation and supply water as and when required. This saves the crops from drought conditions and helps in increasing farm production.\nTank\nA tank acts as an irrigation storage system which is developed by constructing a small bund of earth or stones built across a stream.\nThe rainwater can also be collected in these tank reservoirs for irrigation usage.\nIt is an important source of irrigation in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Kerala, the Bundelkhand area, Rajasthan, and Gujarat.\nDrip irrigation\nIt is a type of micro-irrigation system or localized irrigation system which is the most efficient water and nutrient delivery system for growing crops.\nIt delivers water and nutrients directly to the plant\u2019s roots zone, in the right amounts, at the right time, so each plant gets exactly what it needs, when it needs it, to grow optimally.\nWater is applied near the plant root through emitters or drippers, on or below the soil surface, at a low rate varying from 2-20 liters per hour.\nThis irrigation system lessens soil erosion and weed growth while increasing water application efficiency.\nThe initial cost and maintenance are high for this system.\nSurge irrigation\nSurge Irrigation is an alternative to furrow irrigation where the water supply is pulsed on and off in planned periods.\nThe wetting and drying cycles reduce infiltration rates resulting in faster advance rates and higher uniformities than constant flow.\nDitch irrigation\nDitch Irrigation is a type of traditional method, where ditches are dug out and seedlings are planted in rows.\nThe plantings are watered by placing canals or furrows in between the rows of plants.\nSiphon tubes are used to move the water from the main ditch to the canals.\nSub-irrigation\nAlso known as seepage irrigation is a system where water is allowed to the plant root zone from below the soil surface and absorbed upwards. The excess may be collected for reuse.\nSub-irrigation is used in growing field crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and sugar cane in areas with high water tables.\nThe major benefits of this system are water and nutrient conservation, and labor-saving.\nThe outfitting cost is comparatively high and the main problems include the possibility of the increased presence of disease-causing organisms in recycled water.\nChallenges faced by agriculture\nAgriculture is subject to variations in monsoon in the country. As per the World Bank, only 35% of India\u2019s agricultural land is irrigated. The remaining 65% of farming is rain-dependent, most of which takes place over just a few summer months.\nThe problem of land degradation in rain-fed or dry-land areas is expected to increase in the coming years.\nThe arable or cultivable land is being converted for non-agricultural purposes adding to the food crisis while the population keeps increasing.\nAnother major issue is the overexploitation of groundwater, which is a major concern in the states of Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, etc. Alarmingly, the groundwater level has been going down in almost all parts of the country.\nThe increasing desertification of India\u2019s soil is a threat to every agricultural development in the country.\nGovernment initiatives for irrigation system\n\nPradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana:\n\nLaunched in 2015 with the motto of \u201cHar Khet Ko Paani\u201d, the scheme aims to provide end-to-end solutions in the irrigation supply chain (water sources, distribution network, and, farm-level applications).\nThe scheme focuses on creating sources for assured irrigation and protective irrigation by harnessing rainwater at the micro-level through \u2018Jal Sanchay\u2019 and \u2018Jal Sinchan\u2019.\nOne of the most crucial components of the initiative is \u201cPer Drop More Crop\u201d. It focuses on micro-irrigation systems (sprinkler, drip, pivots, rain guns, etc.) to promote precision farming by making water available in a targeted manner to the root zone of crops.\n\nMicro Irrigation Fund:\n\nThe Government has created a dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund with NABARD.\nThis fund aims to facilitate the States to mobilize the resources for expanding coverage of Micro Irrigation in the country.\n\nRainfed\u00a0Area Development Programme (RADP):\n\nRainfed Area Development Programme (RADP) is an initiative that aims to increase the agricultural productivity of rain-fed areas sustainably by adopting appropriate farming system-based approaches.\nWay forward\n\nThe lack of irrigated land for agriculture is a major issue that needs to be addressed more aggressively. The farmers should be made aware of the numerous options available to them when it comes to irrigation and be educated about it.\n\nVarious alternative methods of irrigation and farming like vertical farming, zero budget natural farming, urban agriculture, agroforestry, etc, should be encouraged.",

Indian Agriculture is dominated by small-scale farming and is characterized by low productivity.\n\nThe Indian agriculture sector employs the largest female labor force in the country which is close to 65%.\n\nBut it suffers from the twin problems of low productivity and excess workforce employed in it resulting in a low per capita productivity of the workforce. This leads to lesser wages and a high level of poverty.\n\nThe agriculture sector in India has undergone very limited liberalization. The state still plays a predominant role in Indian agriculture. It is one of the highly subsidized sectors of the economy because concerns about food security and poverty lead the government to remain strongly involved through fixing prices for key agricultural products at the farm and consumer levels, high border protection, bans on or support for exports, and massive subsidies for key inputs such as fertilizers, water, and electricity.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCropping seasons\nMajor Food crops in various parts of the country\nRice\nWheat\nMillets\nPulses\nMaize\nMajor cash crops in various parts of the country\nSugarcane\nTea\nCoffee\nJute\nCotton\nCropping patterns in India\nChanging cropping patterns in India\nConclusion\nCropping seasons\n\nIndia is geographically very vast, hence it has various food and non-food crops which are cultivated in three main cropping seasons which are rabi, Kharif, and Zaid.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Kharif season starts with the southwest monsoon and supports the cultivation of tropical crops.\nRabi season is for winter crops as these crops require less amount of water for growth.\nWhile Zaid season comes between Rabi and Kharif.\n\nMajor crops in India can be classified into:\n\nFood crops: \u00a0Rice, Wheat, Millets, Maize, and Pulses.\n\nCash crops: Sugarcane, Oilseeds, Horticulture crops, Tea, Coffee, Rubber, Cotton, and Jute.\n\nMajor Food crops in various parts of the country\nRice\nCourtesy: mapsofindia.com\n\nIndia is an important center of rice cultivation. Rice is cultivated in the largest areas in India.\n\nHistorians believe that while the Indica variety of rice was first domesticated in the area covering the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas (i.e. north-eastern India), stretching through Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Southern China, the\u00a0japonica\u00a0variety was domesticated from wild rice in southern China which was introduced to India.\nPerennial wild rice is still growing in Assam and Nepal. It seems to have appeared around 1400 BC in southern India after its domestication in the northern plains.\n\nClimatic Requirements\n\nIn India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate.\n\nRice cultivation in India extends from 8 to35\u00baN latitudes and from sea level to as high as 3000 meters.\nThe Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions that have high humidity, prolonged sunshine, and an assured supply of water.\nIt required around 150-300 cm of rainfall and deep clayey and loamy soil.\nThe average temperature required throughout the life period of the crop ranges from 21 to 37\u00ba C.\nThe maximum temperature which the crop can tolerate is 40\u00ba C to 42\u00ba C.\n\nNutritional value of Rice\n\nRice is a nutritional staple food that provides instant energy as its most important component is carbohydrate (starch).\nRice is poor in nitrogenous substances with an average composition of these substances being only 8 percent and fat content or lipids only negligible, i.e., 1 percent, and due to this reason, it is considered a complete food for eating.\nRice flour is rich in starch and is used for making various food materials. It is also used in some instances by brewers to make alcoholic malt.\nLikewise, rice straw mixed with other materials is used to produce porcelain, glass, and pottery.\nRice is also used in the manufacturing of paper pulp and livestock bedding.\n\nCrop Production Practices\n\nIn India Rice is mainly grown in two types of soils- uplands and low lands. The method of cultivation of rice in a particular region depends largely on factors such as the situation of the land, type of soil, irrigation facilities, availability of laborers intensity, and distribution of rainfalls. The crop of rice is grown with the following methods:\n\nDry or Semi-dry upland cultivation\nBroadcasting the seed\nSowing the seed behind the plow or drilling\nWet or lowland cultivation\nTransplanting in puddled fields.\nBroadcasting sprouted seeds in puddled fields.\n\nSelection of Seeds\n\nThe use of quality seeds in the cultivation of rice is an important factor to get a better crop yield. Seeds intended for sowing should satisfy the following requirements:\n\nThe seed should belong to the proper variety, which is proposed to be grown.\nThe seed should be clean and free from obvious mixtures of other seeds.\nThe seed should be mature, well developed, and plump in size.\nThe seed should be free from obvious signs of age or bad storage.\nThe seed should have a high germinating capacity.\n\nBefore sowing the seed should be treated with fungicides which protect the seed against soil-borne fungi and also give a boost to the seedlings.\n\nWheat\nCourtesy: farmer.gov.in\n\nWheat is the main cereal crop in India. Indian wheat is largely a soft/medium-hard, medium protein, white bread wheat, somewhat similar to U.S. hard white wheat.\n\nWheat grown in central and western India is typically hard, with high protein and high gluten content.\nIndia also produces around 1.0-1.2 million tons of durum wheat, mostly in the state of Madhya Pradesh.\nMost Indian durum is not marketed separately due to segregation problems in the market yards.\n\nThe Government of India appointed a commission in 1961 to assess the feasibility of increasing crop productivity under prevailing Indian ecological conditions. As a result of various steps taken by Govt. of India, the Wheat scenario in our country has completely changed.\n\nIn the post-Independence era, the country used to import Wheat for our needs but due to a bumper increase in the production and productivity of Wheat in the \u2018Green Revolution\u2018 period in the late sixties, our country became self-dependent on Wheat production.\n\nAt present, the country is producing much more excess Wheat than the requirement.\n\nClimate requirement\n\nThe wheat crop has wide adaptability:\n\nIt can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical zones but also in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north, beyond even the 60-degree north latitude.\nWheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring.\nIt can be cultivated from sea level to as high as 3300 meters.\n\nThe best wheat is produced in areas favored with cool, moist weather during the major portion of the growing period followed by dry, warm weather to enable the grain to ripen properly.\n\nThe optimum temperature range for the ideal germination of wheat seed is 20-25\u00ba C.\nRains just after sowing hamper germination and encourage seedling blight.\nAreas with a warm and damp climate are not suited for wheat growing.\n\nDuring the heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures and drought are harmful to wheat. Cloudy weather, with high humidity and low temperatures, is conducive to rust attack. Wheat is mainly a rabi (winter) season crop in India.\n\nSoil\n\nWheat is grown in a variety of soils in India:\n\nSoils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure, and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation.\nHeavy soil with good drainage is suitable for wheat cultivation under dry conditions.\nThese soils absorb and retain rainwater well. Heavy soils with poor structure and poor drainage are not suitable as wheat is sensitive to waterlogging.\nWheat can be successfully grown on lighter soils provided their water and nutrient holding capacity are improved.\nMillets\nCourtesy: mapsofindia.com\n\nGiven the nutritional value of the millets, the Government has notified millets as Nutri-cereals in April 2018. Millets are a rich source of Protein, Fibre, Minerals, Iron, and Calcium and have a low glycemic index. The National Year of Millets was celebrated in 2018.\n\nClimate requirement\n\nMillets require a temperature between 27-32\u00b0C.\nRainfall is around 50-100 cm.\nMillets can be grown in inferior alluvial or loamy soil because they are less sensitive to soil deficiencies.\n\nJowar is a rain-fed crop grown in moist areas with less or no irrigation.\n\nBajra grows in sandy soils and shallow black soil.\n\nRagi requires red, black, sandy, loamy, and shallow black soils which are found in dry regions mostly.\n\nThese are the small-seeded hardy crops that can grow well in dry zones or rain-fed areas under marginal conditions of soil fertility and moisture.\n\nMillets are cultivated in low-fertile land, tribal and rain-fed, and mountainous areas.\nThese areas include Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana.\n\nDue to their short growing season, millets can develop from seeds to ready-to-harvest crops in just about 65 days.\n\nThis highly beneficial characteristic of the millets is of vital importance in thickly populated regions of the world.\nIf stored properly, millets can keep well for two years or beyond.\n\nMillets can not only grow in poor climatic or soil conditions and provide nutritious grain as well as fodder, but these can also very well fit into multiple cropping systems under irrigation as well as dryland farming due to their short growing season.\n\nPulses\nCourtesy: farmer.gov.in\n\nPulses are consumed as Dal, which is a cheap source of plant protein. These are consumed because of bodybuilding properties having the presence of various amino acids.\n\nThese also have medicinal properties. By-products of pulses like leaves, pod coats, and bran are given to animals in the form of dry fodder.\nSome pulse crops like Gram, Lobia, Urdbean & Moongbean are fed to animals as green fodder. Moong plants are also used as a green manure which improves soil health and adds nutrients to the soil.\n\nSeveral pulse crops are grown in India and the world. Among the crops, major ones are Gram, Pigeonpea, Lentil, Fieldpeas, etc. According to history, the origin of Gram is in South West Asia \u2013 probably Afghanistan and Persia, Pigeonpea in Africa, Lentil in Turkey to South Iran, and Fieldpeas in Mediterranean Region of Southern Europe and Western Asia.\n\nClimatic Requirement\n\nPulse crops are cultivated in the Kharif, Rabi, and Zaid seasons of the Agricultural year.\n\nRabi crops require a mild cold climate during the sowing period, during vegetative to pod development cold climate, and during maturity/harvesting warm climate.\nKharif pulse crops require a warm climate throughout their life from sowing to harvesting. Summer pulses are habitants of a warm climate. Seed is required to pass many stages to produce seed like germination, seedling, vegetative, flowering, fruit setting, pod development, and grain maturity/harvesting.\nMaize\nCourtesy: farmer.gov.in\n\nMaize (Zea mays L) is one of the most versatile emerging crops having wider adaptability under varied agro-climatic conditions. Globally, maize is known as the queen of cereals because it has the highest genetic yield potential among the cereals.\n\nMaize in India contributes nearly 9 % to the national food basket. In addition to staple food for human being and quality feed for animals, maize serves as a basic raw material as an ingredient in thousands of industrial products that includes starch, oil, protein, alcoholic beverages, food sweeteners, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, film, textile, gum, package and paper industries, etc.\n\nClimatic conditions\n\nIn India, maize is traditionally grown in the monsoon (Kharif) season, which is accompanied by high temperature (<35\u00b0 C) and rainfall.\nMaize can be grown successfully in a variety of soils ranging from loamy sand to clay loam.\nSoils with good organic matter content having high water holding capacity with neutral pH are considered good for higher productivity.\n\nBeing a sensitive crop to moisture stress particularly excess soil moisture and salinity stresses; it is desirable to avoid low lying fields having poor drainage and also the field having higher salinity. Therefore, the fields having provision of proper drainage should be selected for the cultivation of maize.\n\nMajor cash crops in various parts of the country\nSugarcane\nCourtesy: farmer.gov.in\n\nSugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) family Gramineae (Poaceae) is a widely grown crop in India. It employs over a million people directly or indirectly besides contributing significantly to the national exchequer.\n\nSugarcane growing countries of the world lay between the latitude 36.7\u00b0 north and 31.0\u00b0 south of the equator extending from tropical to subtropical zones.\n\nSugar cane originated in New Guinea where it has been known for thousands of years.\n\nSugar cane plants spread along human migration routes to Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Here it cross-bred with some wild sugar cane relatives to produce the commercial sugar cane we know today.\n\nImportant regions/ zones for sugarcane cultivation in India\n\nBroadly there are two distinct agro-climatic regions of sugarcane cultivation in India, viz., tropical and subtropical. However, five agro-climatic zones have been identified mainly for varietal development. They are (i)North Western Zone (ii) North Central Zone (iii) North Eastern Zone (iv) Peninsular Zone (v) Coastal Zone.\n\nTropical Sugarcane region\n\nThe tropical sugarcane region consists of sugarcane agro-climatic zone 4 (peninsular zone) and 5(Coastal zone) which includes the states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Pondicherry, and Kerala.\n\nSub-tropical sugarcane region: Around 55 percent of the total cane area in the country is in the sub-tropics. U.P, Bihar, Haryana, and Punjab come under this region.\n\nCrop distribution: Sugarcane growing countries of the world are lying between the latitude 36.70 north and 31.00 south of the equator extending from tropical to sub-tropical zones. In India sugarcane is cultivated all over the country from latitude 80 N to 330 N, except in cold hilly areas like Kashmir valley, Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nClimatic requirement\n\nThe different critical stages are germination, tillering, early growth, active growth, and elongation.\n\nThe optimum temperature for sprouting (germination) of stem cuttings is 32\u00b0C to 38\u00b0C.\nIt slows down below 25\u00b0C and reaches a plateau between 30\u00b0-34\u00b0C.\nTemperatures above 38\u00b0C reduce the rate of photosynthesis and increase respiration.\nFor ripening, however, relatively low temperatures in the range of 12\u00b0C to 14\u00b0C are desirable.\n\nReduction in yield of sugarcane due to rise in temperature\n\nThe sugarcane productivity and juice quality are profoundly influenced by weather conditions prevailing during the various crop-growth sub-periods.\n\nSugar recovery is highest when the weather is dry with low humidity; bright sunshine hours, cooler nights with wide diurnal variations, and very little rainfall during the ripening period.\nThese conditions favor high sugar accumulation.\nThe climatic conditions like very high temperatures or very low temperatures deteriorate the juice quality and thus affecting the sugar quality.\nFavorable climates like warm and humid climates favor the insect pests and diseases, which cause much damage to the quality and yield of its juice and finally sucrose contents.\nTea\nCourtesy: mapsofindia.com\n\nIn colonial India, the British had to import tea from China, which caused huge dents in their treasury, so the East India Company started tea plantations in Assam. As the production of tea increased, India started exporting tea to the rest of the world. This contributed to the nation\u2019s economy. By the 1850s, India became one of the biggest tea producers in the world. After independence, local tea brands were introduced as beverages to the masses.\n\nIndia is the second-largest tea producer in the world, right behind China.\n\nClimatic requirements\n\nRequires temperature between 20-30\u00b0C.\nRainfall is around 150-300 cm.\nDeep and fertile well-drained soil, rich in humus and organic matter.\nCoffee\nCourtesy: Coffee Board of India\n\nCoffee was initially brought from Yemen and introduced to the Baba Budan Hills. Hills with a well-defined shade canopy, comprising evergreen leguminous trees provide the optimal condition for coffee cultivation which is why it is mainly concentrated in the hilly regions.\n\nIndian variety of coffee \u2018Arabica\u2019 is famous worldwide.\n\nIndia cultivates all of its coffee under a well-defined two-tier mixed shade canopy, comprising evergreen leguminous trees. Nearly 50 different types of shade trees are found in coffee plantations. Shade trees prevent soil erosion on a sloping terrain; they enrich the soil by recycling nutrients from deeper layers, protect the coffee plant from seasonal fluctuations in temperature, and play host to diverse flora and fauna.\n\nCoffee plantations in India are essential spice worlds too: a wide variety of spices and fruit crops like pepper, cardamom, vanilla, orange, and banana grow alongside coffee plants.\n\nIndia\u2019s coffee-growing regions have diverse climatic conditions, which are well suited for the cultivation of different varieties of coffee. Some regions with high elevations are ideally suited for growing Arabicas of mild quality while those with warm humid conditions are best suited for Robustas.\n\nJute\nCourtesy: farmer.gov.in\n\nJute is an important natural fiber crop in India next to cotton. In trade and industry, jute and Mesta crop together known as raw jute as their uses are almost the same. Raw jute plays an important role in the country\u2019s economy.\n\nRaw jute was originally considered a source of raw material for packaging industries only.\nBut it has now emerged as a versatile raw material for diverse applications, such as textile industries, paper industries, building, and automotive industries, use as soil savers, use as decorative and furnishing materials, etc.\nRaw jute being a bio-degradable and annually renewable source, it is considered an environment-friendly crop and it helps in the maintenance of the environment and ecological balance.\nA further attraction of Jute lies in its easy availability, and inexhaustible quantity at a comparatively cheaper rate.\nMoreover, it can easily be blended with other natural and manmade fibers.\n\nJute cultivation is mainly concentrated in eastern and northeastern India while mesta cultivation is spread almost throughout the country. The crop can be grown in low, medium, and high land situations, with both moisture stress and water stagnating condition.\n\nClimatic conditions:\n\nTemperature: Between 25-35\u00b0C\nRainfall: Around 150-250 cm\nSoil Type: Well-drained alluvial soil\nCotton\n\nRead: Cotton cultivation in India\n\nIndia has the distinction of having the largest area under cotton cultivation which is about 37% of the world\u2019s area under cotton cultivation. Cotton is one of the most important fibers and cash crops of India and plays a\nthe dominant role in the industrial and agricultural economy of the country.\n\nIn India, there are ten major cotton-growing states which are divided into three zones, viz. north zone, central zone, and south zone. The North zone consists of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. The central zone includes Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. The South zone comprises Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.\n\nBesides these ten States, cotton cultivation has gained momentum in the Eastern State of Orissa. Cotton is also cultivated in small areas of non-traditional States such as Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal & Tripura.\n\nClimatic conditions:\n\nCotton is a tropical or sub-tropical crop grown in semi-arid areas of the country (mainly in the Deccan Plateau).\nA hard frost is injurious to cotton cultivation and it requires at least 210 frost-free days.\nOnly light rainfall (50 to 100 cm) is preferred. Cotton can also be cultivated under irrigated conditions.\nIt requires high temperature and bright sunshine for its growth. Cotton requires a clear sky during the flowering stage.\nCropping patterns in India\n\nThe cropping pattern in India is determined mainly by rainfall, climate, temperature, and soil type.\n\nCropping Pattern describes the proportion of area under cultivation of different crops at a point of time, changes in this distribution over time, and factors determining these changes.\n\nThe multiplicity of cropping systems has been one of the main features of Indian agriculture\u00a0and it is attributed to rain-fed agriculture and the prevailing socio-economic situations of the farming communities.\n\nTwo distinct irrigated cropping systems emerged in India:\n\nOne is the Indo-Gangetic Plain region comprising the states of Punjab, Haryana, the plains of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and the plains of Jammu & Kashmir.\nThe other ecosystem may be carved out of coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.\n\nBased on homogeneity and commonness, major crop regions in India may be divided as follows:\n\nRice Region\nWheat Region\nJowar-Bajra Region\nCotton Region\nMillet and Maize Region\nFruit and Spice Region\n\nBased on combinations of crops grown following cropping systems exist in India:\n\nMonocropping: Monocropping is when the field is used to grow only one crop season after season. This is harmful to soil health.\n\nCrop Rotation:\u00a0 Crop Rotation means changing the type of crops grown in the field each season or each year (or changing from crops to fallow). Crop rotation improves the soil structure and fertility, and because it helps control weeds, pests, and diseases.\n\nSequential Cropping:\u00a0Sequential Cropping involves growing two crops in the same field, one after the other in the same year.\n\nIntercropping:\u00a0 Intercropping means growing two or more crops in the same field at the same time.\n\nMixed Intercropping:\u00a0Planting the main crop in rows and then spreading the seeds of the intercrop (such as a cover crop) in between is called mixed intercropping.\n\nRow Intercropping:\u00a0Planting both the main crop and the intercrop in rows. The rows make weeding and harvesting easier than with mixed intercropping.\n\nStir Cropping:\u00a0Stir Cropping involves planting broad strips of several crops in the field.\n\nChanging cropping patterns in India\n\nA cropping pattern is a dynamic concept as it changes over space and time which occurs due to an increase in the prices of crops.\n\nGreen Revolution also led to changes in the cropping patterns. Rice was introduced to Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nNew technologies in Indian agriculture play a vital role in determining the cultivation of crops.\n\nFarmers have changed their crop patterns to reap the benefits of economic expansion due to which they are intensively moving towards the cultivation of cash crops from traditional crops.\n\nPopulation explosion and urbanization have led to land conversion, boosting intensive farming, and have brought changes in cropping patterns.\n\nCropping patterns may also be influenced by government action undertaken in the form of an administrative and legislative measures. Supply of inputs by the government, intensive schemes for various crops, various government campaigns, transportation, and marketing provisions also influence the cropping pattern in the country.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndian agriculture has been seeing a deceleration in growth compared to the growth of the larger economy which has been widening disparities between the incomes of workers in non-agricultural and agricultural sectors.\n\nIndian farmers are very much poverty-stricken and conservative still their cropping pattern can be changed through appropriate changes in economic motives.\n\nThere is a need to shift to sustainable agriculture. The policies should consider the environmental cost as well. The planning should be done with the fact that the next generation also needs to have food security.",

Agroforestry systems are multifunctional systems that can provide a wide range of economic, sociocultural, and environmental benefits.\nTypes of agroforestry\n\nThere are three main types of agroforestry systems:\n\nAgrisilviculturalsystems are a combination of crops and trees, such as alley cropping or home gardens.\nSilvopastoral systems\u00a0combine forestry and grazing of domesticated animals on pastures, rangelands, or on-farm.\nThe three elements, namely trees, animals, and crops, can be integrated into what is called agrosilvopastoral systems and are illustrated by home gardens involving animals as well as scattered trees on croplands used for grazing after harvests.\nWhy is agroforestry important?\nIssues with traditional farming practices:\nA farmer may confront a series of adversities and climatic conditions during agricultural production, such as erratic rainfall, stone hail, drought, flood, and so on.\nIn addition, challenges like post-harvest losses, storage, and unavailability of accessible proper marketing are further aggravating the problem.\nCurrently, the human-wildlife and human-crops conflict, forest fires, organic matter deficit soil, monoculture, plant disease and infestation, migration, and the reluctance of youth towards agriculture are a new array of problems.\nThe traditional approach of low input-based extensive and diversified agricultural practices termed \u2018crop diversification could be an alternate approach that might be used to save farming as a counter-strategy for farming bio-socio-psychological anomalies.\nCrop diversification is a strategy applied to grow more diverse crops from shrinking land resources with an increase in productivity in the same arable land.\nIssues with farming practices in India:\n\nFor more than five decades, Indian agriculture has been facing severe problems related to an increase in input costs to increase productivity. However, the productivity proportional to input is maintained for a certain time before stabilizing and then progressively declines in many cases.\n\nFarmers have been using the common government-promoted Green Revolution cropping pattern of\u00a0rice-wheat-rice for a longer time to enhance productivity.\n\nFollowing the same cropping pattern for a longer period has diminished the specific nutrients from the soil, resulting in soil deficiency along with a declined population of microfauna in the soil.\n\nThe microfaunal population is responsible for the mobilization and absorption of particular nutrients in the crop rhizosphere.\nReduction of the microfaunal population in the soil is a serious issue because, without microfaunal activities, the soil is lost to self-perpetuate and its ecology for crop production.\n\nThe mono-cropping pattern also reduces resource-use efficiency.\n\nTo meet the deficiency of soil nutrients, farmers apply fertilizers periodically, which further results in a change in the soil\u2019s chemical and biological properties.\nMono-cropping patterns have more chances to be attacked by the same types of insects and pests, which in turn are controlled by pumping the insecticides and pesticides. This accumulates the residue of these chemicals in soil which pollutes the soil, crop, and environment.\nWeed infestations are on the rise too, necessitating the application of weedicides or herbicides to eradicate them. Thus, persistent use of chemicals declines productivity reduces resource-use efficiency, and deteriorates soil health.\n\nBreaking the mono-cropping pattern by introducing diverse crops and cropping patterns helps in reviving the soil health and increasing the resource-use efficiency.\n\nThe traditional pattern of agriculture in India has wider crop diversity, is more stable, and is natural.\n\nIn the Garhwal Himalayan region of India,\u00a0Barahnajais has a crop diversification system for cultivating 12 crops in a year.\n\u2018Barah anaaj\u2019 literally means \u201812 foodgrains\u2019 and is the traditional heritage of the area.\n\nThe above issues faced by traditional farming practices can be solved by agroforestry to a great extent.\n\nBenefits of agroforestry\n\nEnvironmental benefits:\n\nReduction of pressure on natural forests.\nAgroforestry is known to have the potential to mitigate the climate change effects through microclimate moderation and natural resources conservation in the short run\nCarbon sequestration: Agroforestry species are known to sequester as much carbon in below-ground biomass as the primary forests, and are far greater than the crop and grass systems.\nAgroforestry enables agricultural land to withstand extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, and climate change.\nAgroforestry increases the nutrient content of soil and prevents soil erosion as well.\n\nEconomic benefits:\n\nTree products and tree services also\u00a0contribute robustly to rural livelihoods.\nFruit, fodder, fuel, fiber, fertilizer, and timber add to food and nutritional security, income generation, and work as\u00a0insurance against crop failure.\nIt provides an alternative for landowners to manage their agricultural land in absence of family labor.\nAgroforestry has significant potential to employ the rural and urban population through production, industrial application, and value addition ventures.\n\nSocial benefits:\n\nAgroforestry provides better and stable income, improving the living standards.\nSelf-dependent villages will be a reality.\n\nGlobal climate goals:\n\nAgroforestry can help the world fulfill international obligations on the climate of creating additional carbon sink by 2030and net-zero by 2070.\nIt will help tackle desertification meeting targets of sustainable development goals (SDGs).\nAgroforestry in India\nIndia became the first country to adopt an agroforestry policy \u2013\u00a0National Agroforestry Policy (NAP) in 2014 to promote employment, productivity, and environmental conservation.\n2016 saw NAP being pushed to national effort with funds to transform agroforestry.\nIn the 2022-23 union budget, the finance minister of India highlighted the aim to promote agroforestry in India.\nBut the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare merged the SMAF with the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna which deprived the agroforestry sector of its flagship implementation arm\nThe National Agroforestry Policy 2014:\nPromote agroforestry to increase farm income and livelihoods of rural households, especially the small and marginal farmers.\nProtect and stabilize ecosystems, and promote resilient cropping and farming systems to minimize the risk during extreme climatic events.\nSimultaneously provide raw material to wood-based industries. Thus creating new avenues for rural employment, and reducing pressure on the forests.\nTo develop capacity and strengthen research in agroforestry and create a massive people\u2019s movement for achieving these objectives.\nChallenges for agroforestry\n\nAdverse effects on agricultural land:\n\nIn the fields along which trees have been planted, the productivity per unit area decreases, as in at least about two meters from the trees the moisture content in the soil is significantly reduced.\nUnscientific planning can also negatively impact the agricultural productivity of the land.\nWith increased diversity, the risks of pests and diseases may also increase.\n\nLack of knowledge in farmers:\n\nMany farmers are not keen to take it up because of a lack of information on tree rotation and\u00a0also the\u00a0legal aspects involved in the trade of matured trees.\nThe tendency of farmers to opt for market-oriented trees rather than the trees which are more ecologically suited or are locally needed (fuelwood/fodder).\nAgroforestry has benefitted the big farmers more than the marginal and small farmers.\n\nEffect on the food industry:\n\nThe diversion of good agricultural land from cereal and commercial crops may create a scarcity of food and industrial raw material.\nPossible negative impact on crop production because of planting trees on fertile lands.\nWay forward\n\nThe concept needs to be financially backed and promoted with more zeal. Proper training and information should be given to the farmers for them to adopt the method scientifically.\n\nFarmer collectives like cooperatives,\u00a0self-help groups,\u00a0Farmer -Producer Organisations (FPOs)\u00a0must be promoted for building capacities to foster the expansion of tree-based farming and value chain development.\n\nPolicymakers should incorporate agroforestry in all policies relating to land use and natural resource management, and encourage government investments in agroforestry-related infrastructure.",

Read here to know more.\n\nIndian agriculture is evolving every day towards sustainable farming practices. With increasing industrialization and population, the availability of arable lands for agriculture is getting lesser.\n\nIn such a situation, new and innovative farming practices are to be used such as zero budget natural farming and vertical farming which have been gaining popularity in the past decade.\n\nGilbert Ellis Bailey coined the term vertical farming\u00a0in 1915 and also wrote a book of the same name.\n\nThe modern concept was first proposed in 1999 by Professor Dickson Despommier which was centered on the idea that urban areas should grow their food which can save time and resources required for transportation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is vertical farming?\nAdvantages and disadvantages of vertical farming\nTypes of vertical farming\nHydroponics\nAeroponics\nAquaponics\nWay forward\nWhat is vertical farming?\n\nIn vertical farming, crops are grown indoors, under artificial conditions of light and temperature.

It holds the largest share in the global vertical farming market. In Japan, vertical farming is born out of necessity whereas traditional farming is losing its face due to the aging population and rural migration.\n\nVertical farming systems come under the broad classification of protected cultivation wherein the variable physical parameters like temperature, water, soil, humidity, etc can be regulated.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of vertical farming\n\nVertical Farming has several advantages, which make it promising for the future of agriculture.\n\nThe land requirement is quite low, water consumption is 80 percent less, the water is recycled and saved, it is pesticide-free, and in cases of high-tech farms, there is no real dependency on the weather.\nA vertical farm can be set up within the confines of a city.\nAnd when the farms are nearby, the product is quickly delivered and always fresh; when compared to the refrigerated produce usually available at supermarkets.\nReduction in transportation reduces the fossil fuel cost & resulting emissions and thus also reduce the spoilage in transportation.\n\nHowever, vertical farming has its drawbacks.\n\nInitial capital costs for establishing the vertical farming system are the major problem.\nIn addition, there are costs of erecting the structures along with its automation like computerized and monitoring systems, remote control systems and software, automated racking and stacking systems, programmable LED lighting systems, climate control system, etc.\nTypes of vertical farming\n\nThere are three major soil-less methods of vertical farming- hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics.\n\nHYDROPONICS\n\nIn the early 1930s, William Frederick Gerick pioneered hydroponics at the University of California at Berkley.\n\nIt is a method of growing food in water using mineral nutrient solutions without soil.\n\nThe basic advantage of this method is that it reduces soil-related cultivation problems like soil-borne insects, pests, and diseases.\n\nA hydroponics system eliminates the need for soil by providing a nutrient-charged aqueous solution directly to the roots that keep the plant fed and hydrated, while supplemental lighting solutions mimic sunlight.\n\nIn a hydroponics growing system, plants are either suspended directly in the aqueous solution or grown in a soil-free medium such as coconut coir, rock wool, LECA, vermiculite, or perlite. The plant\u2019s roots receive the nutrient solution in either an active system or a passive system.\n\nActive systems\u00a0use pumps to circulate and aerate nutrient solutions, delivering the nutrients to the plant\u2019s root zone for uptake.\nPassive systems\u00a0have no pumps or moving parts. The nutrient solutions are fed to the root zone through flooding, gravity, or capillary action.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nAn extended growing season\nImproved growth and yield\nHigher plant density\nPlants can grow anywhere\nLess water consumption\nFewer pest problems\nEasier to harvest mature plants\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nExpensive to set up compared to traditional gardening methods\nVulnerable to power outages due to dependence on electricity for light, water pump, aerators, etc.\nRequires constant monitoring and maintenance.\nVulnerable to waterborne diseases\nWithout soil as a buffer, plants get negatively affected by physical changes quicker.\nAEROPONICS\n\nThe invention of\u00a0aeroponics\u00a0was motivated by the initiative of\u00a0NASA\u00a0(the National Aeronautical and Space Administration, USA) to find an efficient way to grow plants in space in the 1990s.\n\nIn aeroponics, there is no growing medium and hence, no containers for growing crops. In aeroponics, mist or nutrient solutions are used instead of water. As the plants are tied to support and roots are sprayed with nutrient solution, it requires very less space, very less water, and no soil.\n\nCompared to regular hydroponic plants, the plants tend to grow faster and absorb more nutrients because the roots are exposed to more oxygen. Also, there are fewer threats of diseases around root zone disease because there\u2019s no place for debris or pathogen to reside.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nMaximum nutrient absorption for plant roots due to no growing medium\nMassive plant growth because plant roots are exposed to oxygen 24/7. This promotes healthy and fast-growing plants. The mist used on the roots can also be sterilized to prevent plant diseases.\nHigher yields in smaller spaces.\nConsiderably fewer nutrients and water are used on average compared to other systems because of the higher nutrient absorption rate.\nMobility- plants can be moved around easily.\nEasy system maintenance because there is no growing medium used and the system can be cleaned easily\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nRequires constant attention to pH and nutrient density ratio because this system is sensitive.\nThe cost for initial setup can be high.\nSusceptible to power outages.\nRequire technical knowledge as it is one of the most technical to set up.\nDependence on the system. An aeroponic system is made of mist nozzles, high-pressure pumps, and a timer.\nRequire regular disinfection of the root chamber (a common disinfectant is hydrogen peroxide) to prevent root diseases.\nMicroorganisms can be introduced to plant roots through the water.\nAQUAPONICS\n\nThe term aquaponics is coined by combining two words: aquaculture, which refers to fish farming, and hydroponics the technique of growing plants without soil, to create symbiotic relationships between the plants and the fish.\n\nThe symbiosis is achieved as nutrient-rich waste from fish tanks serves as \u201cfertigate\u201d to hydroponic production beds. In turn, the hydroponic beds also function as bio-filters that remove gases, acids, and chemicals, such as ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates, from the water.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nSustainable and intensive food production system\u00a0sustainable;\nAquaponics is an extremely water-efficient system.\nDoesn\u2019t require soil and therefore it\u2019s not susceptible to soil-borne diseases\nDoesn\u2019t require using fertilizers or chemical pesticides;\nHigher yields and qualitative production; higher level of biosecurity and lower risks from outer contaminants;\nAquaponics can be used on non-arable lands such as deserts, degraded soil, or salty, sandy islands;\nFrom a nutritional standpoint, aquaponics provides food in the form of both protein (from the fish) and vegetables\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nThe very high initial start-up costs compared with both hydroponics and soil production systems.\nAquaponics requires deep expertise in the natural world.\nIt\u2019s often hard to find a perfect match between the needs (such as pH, temperature, substrate) of fish and plants;\nAquaponics has fewer management options compared with stand-alone aquaculture or hydroponics;\nMistakes in managing the system can quickly cause its collapse;\nDaily management is needed and has energy costs;\nFish feed needs to be purchased regularly;\nThe products of aquaponics alone aren\u2019t enough to ensure a balanced diet.\nWay forward\n\nVertical farming practice is still in a nascent stage in India, but it needs to be encouraged more to ensure better food security with the increasing population. It can aid in tackling malnutrition and promises better food distribution.\n\nA variety of stakeholders from household farmers and small- to large-scale farmers can be taught the specific knowledge and skills needed for safe, successful, and sustainable implementation.\n\nWith vertical farming techniques, the discussions around farming can move away from land constraints to focus more on sustainable farming techniques.\n\nThe science of different vertical farming techniques can be taught at the school level itself, hence developing sustainable practitioners at a young age itself.",

Read here to learn more about Indian agriculture.\n\nIndia has one of the largest plain areas in the world Indo-Gangetic Plain which is immensely fertile.\n\nIndia has a variety of climatic conditions and soil types.\n\nThese physical variations along with factors like availability of irrigation, use of machinery, and modern agricultural inputs like High Yielding Varieties (HYV) of seeds, insecticides, and pesticides have played important roles in the evolution of different farming practices in the Indian agriculture sector.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypes of farming in India\ni) Subsistence farming:\nii) Intensive and Extensive farming\niii) Commercial farming\niv) Plantation Farming\nv) Mixed Farming\nFeatures of Indian Agriculture\nChallenges for Indian Agriculture\nIndian Agriculture: Important Facts\nTypes of farming in India\n\nSome of the major types of farming are discussed below.\n\ni) Subsistence farming:\n\nThe majority of farmers in India practice subsistence farming- farming for their consumption. The entire production is largely consumed by the farmers and their families and they do not have any surplus to sell in the market.\n\nIn this type of farming, landholdings are small and fragmented; cultivation techniques are primitive and simple. There is a total absence of modern equipment like tractors and farm inputs like chemical fertilizers, insecticides, and pesticides. In this farming, farmers mostly cultivate cereals along with oilseeds, pulses, vegetables, and sugarcane.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSubsistence farming is further classified into:\n\nIntensive\nPrimitive\n\nPrimitive subsistence agriculture is practised on patches of land with the help of primitive tools like simple digging tools and community or family labour. This type of farming is monsoon depending on the fertility of the soil and other environmental conditions. Examples of such types are shifting agriculture and nomadic herding.\n\nShifting agriculture is practised in thickly forested regions like the Amazon basin, tropical Africa, parts of southeast Asia, and northeast India. These areas receive heavy rainfall hence the vegetation regenerates quickly.\nA patch of land is cleared by felling trees and burning them. The ashes are then mixed with the soil and crops like maize, yam, potatoes, and cassava are grown. The land is abandoned once fertility is reduced.\nNomadic herding is practised in the semi-arid and arid regions of the Sahara, Central Asia, and some parts of India like Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir.\nHerdsmen move from place to place with their animals for fodder and water, along defined routes and such movement arises due to seasonal changes. Animals like sheep, camel, yak, and goats are most commonly reared.\n\nIntensive subsistence agriculture is done on small lands with simple tools and more labour. The produce is enough for local consumption and to be sold outside. The sunny climate and fertile soil for most of the year permit the cultivation of more than one crop annually on the same plot. Rice, wheat, maize, pulses, and oilseeds are generally cultivated.\n\nii) Intensive and Extensive farming\n\nThe basic difference between these two types of farming is the amount of production per unit of land. In comparison temperate areas of the USA, Canada, and India do not practice extensive cultivation.\n\nWhen a large patch of land is used for cultivation then we call it extensive farming. Here, total production may be high due to the larger area but per unit production is low.\n\nIntensive Farming records high production per unit of land. An example of intensive cultivation is in Kerala where the availability of land for cultivation is very limited.\n\niii) Commercial farming\n\nIt is just the opposite of subsistence farming as most of the produce is sold in the market for earning money. In this system, farmers use inputs like irrigation, chemical fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, High Yielding Varieties of seeds, etc.\n\nSome of the major commercial crops grown in different parts of India are cotton, jute, sugarcane, groundnut, etc.\n\nRice farming in Haryana is mainly for commercial purposes as people of this area are predominantly wheat eaters. However, in the East and North-Eastern states of India, rice cultivation would be a large subsistence type.\n\niv) Plantation Farming\n\nIn this type, a single cash crop is grown for sale in national and international markets. This type of agriculture involves the growing and processing of a single cash crop purely meant for sale.\n\nTea, coffee, rubber, bananas, and spices are all examples of plantation crops. Most of these crops were introduced in India by the Britishers in the 19th Century\n\nv) Mixed Farming\n\nWhen both raising crops and rearing animals are carried on simultaneously it is called mixed farming. Farmers engaged in mixed farming have economic advantages as well.\n\nAll classifications are based on the nature and purpose of farming hence they may overlap in some cases. For example, Banana is a plantation type of farming but can also be classified as commercial farming.\n\nFeatures of Indian Agriculture\n\nSubsistence Agriculture: Most parts of India have subsistence agriculture which has been practised in India for several hundreds of years and still prevails.\n\nThe pressure of population on Agriculture: Despite the increase in urbanization and industrialization, about 70% of the population is still directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture.\n\nMechanization in agriculture: Even after more than forty years of the Green Revolution and the revolution in agricultural machinery and equipment, complete mechanization is still not achieved.\n\nMonsoon dependency: Despite the large-scale expansion, only about one-third of the total cropped area is irrigated today. As a consequence, two-thirds of cropped areas are still dependent upon the monsoon.\n\nVariety of crops: Since India has both tropical and temperate climates, crops of both climates are found in India. There are very few countries in the world that have variety comparable to that of India. You would realize that when we would discuss the different types of crops in detail.\n\nThe predominance of food crops: The production of food crops is the priority of the farmers almost everywhere in the country.\n\nSeasonal patterns: India has three distinct agricultural/cropping seasons\u2013 Kharif, rabi, and Zaid. In India, there are specific crops grown in these three seasons. For example, rice is a Kharif crop whereas wheat is a Rabi crop.\n\nChallenges for Indian Agriculture\n\nThe challenges faced by Indian agriculture can be broadly grouped into two categories- the long-standing problems and the emerging issues from the prevailing agricultural practices, system, changing climate, and economy.\n\nStagnation in Production of Major Crops: The production of some of the major staple food crops like rice and wheat has been stagnating for quite some time. This is a situation that is worrying our agricultural scientists, planners, and policymakers as it creates a huge gap between the demand of the ever-growing population and the production.\n\nHigh cost of Farm Inputs: Farm inputs include fertilizer, insecticide, pesticides, HYV seeds, farm labour cost, etc. Such an increase puts low and medium-land-holding farmers at a disadvantage.\n\nSoil Exhaustion: The Green Revolution has played a positive role in reducing hunger in India but has negative consequences also. One of which is Soil exhaustion which means the loss of nutrients in the soil from farming the same crop over and over again.\n\nGroundwater depletion: The second negative consequence of the green revolution is the depletion of fresh groundwater. Most of the irrigation in dry areas of Punjab, Haryana, and Western Uttar Pradesh was carried out by excessive use of groundwater. Today fresh groundwater situation in these states is alarming.\n\nGlobal Climatic Change: It has been predicted that climate change\u2019s impact on Indian agriculture will be immense. It is predicted that due to climate change, the temperature will increase, leading to an increase in sea level, more intense cyclones, unpredictable rainfall, etc. These changes would adversely affect the production of rice and wheat. Specifically, a rise in temperature in winter would affect the production of wheat in north India. Production of rice would be affected in coastal areas of India due to the ingress of saline water and an increase in the frequency of cyclones.\n\nImpact of Globalisation: All developing countries have been affected by globalization. The most evident effect is the reduction in farmers\u2019 income and the threat to the viability of cultivation in India. This is due to the rising input costs and falling output prices. This reflects the combination of reduced subsidy and protection to farmers. Trade liberalization exposes these farmers to competition from highly subsidized production in the developed world.\n\nProviding Food Security: Before the introduction of the green revolution in India, we were not self-sufficient in terms of our food grain production. But last few decades agriculture has not grown with the increasing population and to ensure food security factors like accessibility, affordability as well nutritional value of the food available should be catered to.\n\nFarmers Suicides: The farmer suicides appear concentrated in regions of high commercialization of Indian agriculture and very high peasant debt. Cash crop farmers seemed far more vulnerable than those growing food crops. Commercialization of the countryside along with a massive decline in investment in agriculture was the beginning of the decline. Privatization of many resources has also compounded the problems.\n\nIndian Agriculture: Important Facts\n\nThe Economic Survey of India 2020-21 report stated that in FY20:\n\nThe total food grain production in the country was recorded at 296.65 million tonnes (up by 11.44 million tonnes compared with 285.21 million tonnes in FY19).\nThe government has set a target to buy 42.74 million tonnes from the central pool in FY21; this is 10% more than the quantity purchased in FY20.\nFor FY22, the government has set a record target for farmers to raise food grain production by 2% with 307.31 million tonnes of food grains.\nIn FY21, production was recorded at 303.34 million tonnes against a target of 301 million tonnes\nGross Value Added (GVA) by agriculture, forestry, and fishing was estimated at Rs. 19.48 lakh crore in FY20.\nThe share of agriculture and allied sectors in GVA of India at current prices stood at 17.8 % in FY20.\nConsumer spending in India will return to growth in 2021 after the pandemic-led contraction, expanding by as much as 6.6%.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0\n\nAgriculture export policy\nNew Schemes for Farmers",

Privatized seeds, inputs, and markets are inaccessible and expensive for peasants. Indian farmers increasingly find themselves in a vicious cycle of debt, because of the high production costs, high-interest rates for credit, the volatile market prices of crops, the rising costs of fossil fuel-based inputs, and private seeds. Debt is a problem for farmers in India in the end pushing them towards poverty as well.\u201d\n\nUnder such conditions, \u2018zero budget\u2019 farming promises to end a reliance on loans and drastically cut production costs, ending the debt cycle for desperate farmers.\n\nThe word \u2018budget\u2019 refers to credit and expenses, thus the phrase \u2018Zero Budget\u2019 means without using any credit, and without spending any money on purchased inputs. \u2018Natural farming\u2019 means farming with nature and without chemicals.\n\nIn other words, Zero Budget Natural Farming is a method of chemical-free agriculture drawing from traditional Indian practices. It relies on Agro-ecology.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt was originally promoted by Maharashtrian agriculturist and Padma Shri recipient Subhash Palekar, who developed it in the mid-1990s as an alternative to the Green Revolution\u2019s methods driven by chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and intensive irrigation.\n\nWhat is Agro-Ecology?\n\nAgroecology is sustainable farming that works with nature. While ecology is the study of relationships between plants, animals, people, and their environment and the balance between these relationships.\n\nAgroecology is the application of ecological concepts and principles in farming.\n\nAgroecology promotes farming practices that:\n\nMitigate climate change by reducing emissions, recycling resources, and prioritizing local supply chains.\nWork with wildlife by managing the impact of farming on wildlife and harnessing nature for functions like pollinating crops and controlling pests.\nHelps farmers and communities by giving power to approaches that adapt agricultural techniques to suit the local area and its specific social, environmental, and economic conditions.\n\nAgroforestry is the best example of agroecological practices. It is the practice of combining trees and farming; it demonstrates how food production and nature can co-exist.\n\nGrazing farm animals under trees gives them shelter and fodder, whilst their manure enriches the soil.\n\nPlanting trees on land normally used to grow cereal crops can provide other benefits like fruits, nuts, or timber. This provides another income stream for farmers and also prevents soil erosion, as the deep roots of trees help create a healthy soil structure.\n\nWhy do we need zero budget natural farming?\nThe need was intensified by the rising cost of these external inputs causing indebtedness and suicide among farmers, while the impact of chemicals on the environment and long-term fertility was devastating.\nWithout the need to spend money on these inputs or take loans to buy them the cost of production could be reduced and farming made into a \u201czero budget\u201d exercise, breaking the debt cycle for many small farmers.\nMethods used in ZBNF\n\nThe four pillars of ZBNF are:\n\nBijamrutha (Seed treatment)\nJeevamrutha (No fertilizers and pesticides)\nMulching (Soil, straw, and live)\nWhapasa (Soil moisture)\n\nZBNF promotes the application of\u00a0jeevamrutha, a mixture of fresh desi cow dung and aged desi cow urine, jaggery, pulse flour, water, and soil on farmland.\n\nThis is a fermented microbial culture that adds nutrients to the soil and acts as a catalytic agent to promote the activity of microorganisms and earthworms in the soil.\nAbout 200 liters of jeevamrutha should be sprayed twice a month per acre of land; after three years, the system is supposed to become self-sustaining.\n\nAnother mixture, called\u00a0bijamrita, is used to treat seeds, and concoctions using neem leaves and pulp, tobacco, and green chilies are prepared for insect and pest management.\n\nThe ZBNF method also promotes soil aeration, minimal watering, intercropping, bunds, and topsoil mulching and discourages intensive irrigation and deep ploughing. Acchadana (Mulching) protects topsoil during cultivation and does not destroy it by tilling.\n\nWhapasa is the condition where there are both air molecules and water molecules present in the soil, thereby helping in reducing irrigation requirements.\n\nSurveys supporting the ZBNF\nThe National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data shows that almost 70% of agricultural households spend more than they earn and more than half of all farmers are in debt.\nIn States such as Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, levels of indebtedness are around 90%, where each household bears an average debt of \u20b91 lakh.\nTo achieve the Central government\u2019s promise to double farmers\u2019 income by 2022, one aspect being considered is natural farming methods such as the ZBNF which reduce farmers\u2019 dependence on loans to purchase inputs they cannot afford. Meanwhile, inter-cropping allows for increased returns.\nThe Economic Survey has also highlighted the ecological advantages.\nThe FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the united nations) also supports and encourages the ZBNF methodologies.\nIn June 2018,\u00a0Andhra Pradesh rolled out an ambitious plan to become\u00a0India\u2019s first State to practice 100% natural farming by 2024.\nArguments against Zero budget natural farming\nThough limited studies in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have shown a decline in the input costs and improvement in yields; the long terms returns were seen dropping in a few years.\nThe wholesale move away from conventional methods to ZBNF without widescale studies on yield may result in a negative impact on the agro sector.\nSikkim, India\u2019s first organic state also has seen a drop in output and income after a few years.\nZBNF has helped preserve soil fertility, but its role in boosting productivity and farmers\u2019 income is not satisfactory yet.\nZBNF encourages the need for an Indian breed cow, whose numbers are declining at a fast pace. According to Livestock Census, the country\u2019s total population of indigenous and nondescript cattle has dropped by 8.1%.\nThe Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, which was meant to promote organic farming and soil health has been allocated Rs 325 crore only, whereas Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, a flagship Green Revolution scheme had an allocation of Rs 3,745 crore for the financial year 2019-20.\nPresent scenario\nNITI Aayog has been promoting the idea of Zero budget natural farming and supporting multi-location studies for assessing the pros and cons of the methods.\nThe Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) is studying the ZBNF methods practised by basmati and wheat farmers in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Uttarakhand.\nThe funding shortage is also been looked into parallel with the scientific studies.\nZero-budget natural farming (ZBNF) in news\n\nPrime Minister Modi announced on 19th November 2021 that the new farm laws enacted in 2019 will be repealed in the winter session of Parliament.\n\nHe also added that the government has decided to implement zero-budget natural farming.\n\nWay forward\n\nOther aspects in structural and economic marketing also need to be addressed to complement the Zero budget natural farming method which may include:\n\nImproving agricultural market infrastructure\nExpanding the procurement mechanisms to more foodgrains and non-foodgrains\nPrice deficiency payment systems for a few crops\nMSP and cost of cultivation balance\nMinimum export price for agricultural commodities should be a rethink\nOther agricultural and farmer schemes should be linked with schemes like MGNREGS for reducing costs of cultivation.\n\nRead:\n\nShould India focus on natural farming?",

India Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is responsible for monetary policy. Repo, Reverse Repo, CRR, SLR etc are part of monetary policy.\n\nREPO rate\n\nREPO\u00a0means\u00a0Re\u00a0Purchase\u00a0Option \u2013 the rate by which RBI gives loans to other banks. Bank re-purchases the securities deposited with RBI at the REPO rate.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the current REPO rate is 4.5%. This means RBI gives loans to other banks at a 4.5% interest rate.\n\nReverse REPO rate\n\nRBI at times borrows from banks at a rate lower than the REPO rate, and that rate is known as the Reverse REPO rate.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the current Reverse REPO rate is 4%. This means banks give loans to RBI at a 4% interest rate.\n\nREPO and Reverse Repo are two major options under LAF (Liquidity Adjustment Facility).\n\nAlso see: REPO and CRR Rate Cuts \u2013 What Should You Understand?\n\nMarginal Standing Facility (MSF)\n\nMSF is the rate at which scheduled commercial banks could borrow money overnight from RBI against approved securities.\n\nThe borrowing limit of banks under the marginal standing facility is 2 per cent of their respective Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL).\n\nLet\u2019s assume the current MSF Rate is 5.5%. This means commercials banks can borrow money from RBI overnight equal to 2% of their deposits at a 5.5% interest rate. You may note that MSF rate is usually higher than the REPO rate.\n\nBank Rate\n\nThe bank rate is a higher rate, (usually 1% higher than the REPO rate) charged by RBI when it gives loans to commercial banks.\n\nTo get a figure, let\u2019s assume the present bank rate is 5.5 %. This is higher than the REPO rate of 4.5%. However, you may wonder how Bank Rate is different from MSF.\n\nThe Bank rate is different from MSF in the nature that the Bank rate is long term. It applies to all commercial banks and there is no limitation like 2 per cent of their respective Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL).\n\nAlso read: Effects of Liberalization on the Indian Economy\n\nCRR\n\nCRR corresponds to Cash Reserve Ratio.\n\nIt corresponds to the percentage of liquid reserves each bank have to keep as cash reserve with RBI (in their current accounts) corresponding to the deposits they have.\n\nBanks will not get any interest for these deposits.\n\nTo get a mental picture, let\u2019s assume the present CRR is 3%.\n\nSLR\n\nSLR (Statutory Liquidity Ratio) corresponds to the percentage of liquid reserves each bank have to keep as cash reserve with themselves corresponding to the deposits they have.\n\nBanks have to mandatory keep reserves corresponding to SLR locked with themselves in the form of gold or government securities.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the present SLR is 18.5 %.\n\nThe main difference between CRR and SLR is that banks need to keep CRR with RBI, but SLR with themselves, but locked.\n\nCRAR\n\nCapital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio is arrived at by dividing the capital of the bank by aggregated risk-weighted assets.\n\nThe higher the CRAR of a bank the better capitalized it is.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nFiscal policy refers to the policy actions of the Government. Budget, tax, subsidies, expenditure etc. form part of the fiscal policy. You might need to understand various deficits like Fiscal Deficit and Primary Deficit as part of Fiscal Policy.\n\nFiscal Deficit (FD): \u00a0The\u00a0fiscal deficit is the difference between the government\u2019s total expenditure and its total receipts (excluding borrowing). In layman\u2019s terms, FD corresponds to borrowings and other liabilities.\n\nBalance of Payments\n\nCurrent Account Deficit (CAD):\u00a0Current Account is the sum of the\u00a0balance of trade\u00a0(exports minus imports of goods and services),\u00a0net factor income\u00a0(such as interest and dividends) and\u00a0net transfer payments (such as foreign aid). The current account deficit in simple terms is dollars flowing in minus dollars flowing out.\n\nAlso, see Fiscal Deficit and Current Account Deficit.\n\nCapital Account Deficit:\u00a0Capital account Deficit occurs when payments made by a country for purchasing foreign assets exceed payments received by that country for selling domestic assets. (For example, if Indians are buying a lot of properties in the US, but if Americans are not buying any properties or buildings in India, India will have a Capital Account Deficit.)\n\nA deficit in the\u00a0capital account means money is flowing out of the country, but it also suggests the nation is increasing its claims on foreign assets. In other words at times of Capital Account Deficit, foreign investment in domestic assets is less and investment by the domestic economy in foreign assets is more.

Land (Natural Resources)\n\nThe first factor of production is land.\n\nHowever, in economics, by land, we mean all that is given to us free by nature.\n\nThis includes not just land, but anything that comes from the land.\n\nMost of the natural resources like soil, water, forests, minerals, petroleum, sunlight, wind etc come under the category of land \u2013 the first factor of production.\n\nNote: The income that the owners of the land earn in return for land resources is called rent.\n\n2. Labour (Human Resources)\n\nWhile natural resources are one factor of production, human resources are another.\n\nThe second factor of production\u00a0 \u2013 Labour \u2013 includes all efforts of human beings used for the production of goods and services. Labour include physical and mental labour.\n\nNote: The income earned by labour resources is called wages.\n\n3. Physical Capital (Man-made Resources)\n\nCapital includes all the man-made resources used for producing goods and services like buildings, machines, equipment, vehicles, stock of materials etc.\n\nCapital denotes all tools humans use to produce goods and services. For example, a stethoscope is the capital of a doctor.\n\nPhysical capital can be broadly divided into two categories \u2013 Fixed Capital and Working Capital.\n\nTools, machines, buildings etc that can be used in production over many years are called fixed capital.\n\nRaw materials and money in hand are called working capital. Unlike tools, machines and buildings, these are used up in production.\n\nYou should note here that some economists do not consider money in hand as capital. This is because money merely facilitates trade, but it is not in itself a productive resource. Only if it is a productive resource, it can be considered as capital (fixed capital). It is not money but the capital goods such as machinery and tools bought by the money that are used to produce goods and services.\n\nNote: The income earned by owners of capital resources is interest.\n\n4. Human Capital (Entrepreneurship OR Entrepreneur OR Enterprise)\n\nOnly those with knowledge and entrepreneurial skills will be able to put together land, labour and physical capital and produce an output.\n\nThus the fourth factor of production is entrepreneurship. These days, entrepreneurship (the knowledge and skillset) is also known as Human Capital.\n\nUnless somebody takes an initiative, no business can be started. The one who takes this initiative is termed an entrepreneur.\n\nAn entrepreneur is a person who combines the other factors of production \u2013 land, labour, and capital \u2013 to earn a profit.\n\nThink of the entrepreneurship of Bill Gates, Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos.\n\nNote: The income accruing to the entrepreneur is termed as profit.\n\nIncome Types: Factor Income and Non-Factor Income\n\nWhat is the meaning of income?\n\nWhat are the types of income?\n\nWe have so far seen that people receive different types of incomes \u2013 rent, wages, interest, and profit.\n\nWe also receive gifts and donations from others without giving anything in return.\n\nAll these incomes can be grouped into two types of incomes \u2013 Factor incomes and Non-factor incomes\n\nFactor Income\n\nA factor income is an income accruing to a factor of production in return for the services rendered to the production unit.\n\nFor example for the services rendered, land receives rent, labour receives wages, capital receives interest, and entrepreneur receives profit.\n\nNon- factor income\n\nThere are certain money receipts that do not involve any sacrifice on the part of their recipients. They are not earned by playing a role as a factor of production \u2013 hence this income has no connection with the production of any goods and services. Such incomes are known as non-factor income.\n\nExamples include\u00a0gifts, donation charities, taxes, fines etc.\n\nNo production activity is involved in getting these incomes.\n\nThese incomes are also called transfer incomes because such income merely represents the transfer of money without any good or service being provided in return for the receipts.\n\nThese incomes are not included in national income.\n\nWhy is it not easy to produce more goods and services?\n\nLet\u2019s try to find the answer to the question we raised at the beginning.\n\nWe have now learned that if we produce more goods and services we earn more income. It can be either as rent, wages, interest, or profit.\n\nThe more income a country generates, the richer it will become.\n\nThen, why nations are not able to increase production? Why is it not easy to increase Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?\n\nIt is not easy to produce more goods are services because factors of production are limited in nature.\n\nYes, goods and services are scarce because the four factors of production (land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship) are scarce.\n\nOnce we realise this concept, it is easy to understand most of the economic principles.\n\nEconomics is the study of how society allocates these scarce resources (land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship) to produce output (goods and services).\n\nThe scarce resources \u2013 four factors of production \u2013 land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship \u2013 form the building blocks of any economy.",

    "[CONTENT] #402": "India has shifted to a new GDP series. The organisation responsible for calculating national income \u2013 CSO (Central Statistical Organisation) \u2013 adopted a new series based on the year 2011-12 instead of the previous 2004-05.\n\nOne might need to understand a few technical terms like GVA at basic prices, production tax, product tax etc. to understand the changes brought about in the new series, which\u00a0is explained below.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNational Income\nGDP\nFactor Cost vs Basic Price vs Market Price\nGVA\nIndian GDP series \u2013 Base Year 2004-05\nIndian GDP series \u2013 Base Year 2011-12\nResults of the change\nProduction taxes vs Product taxes\nGDP at Factor Cost vs GVA at Basic Prices\nSummary\nModel Prelims Questions about the Indian GDP series\nReference:\nNational Income\n\n\nThe total income of a nation can be expressed using many parameters like GDP, GNP, NDP, NNP etc. There are again sub-variations like GDP at factor cost, GVA at basic price, GDP at market price etc.\n\nGDP\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total money value of all final goods and services produced in the economic territories of a\u00a0country in a given year.\nIn simple\u00a0terms, GDP is\u00a0the product of the quantity of goods (and services) produced with their final price (value).\nGDP can be expressed at the constant price and at the current price. Constant price calculations are inflation adjusted (real GDP), while current price calculations include the inflation component too (nominal GDP).\nGDP can also be expressed at factor cost and market prices.\nFactor Cost vs Basic Price vs Market Price\n\nGeneral Relationship between Factor Cost and Market Price:\u00a0Factor Cost + Indirect Tax \u2013 Subsidies = Market Price.\nThe relationship between Factor Cost and Basic Price:\u00a0Factor cost + production tax \u2013 production subsidies = Basic prices.\nThe relationship between Basic Price and Market Price: Basic Price + Product tax \u2013 Product Subsidy = Market Price.\nNote: Thus, it is clear that market price includes both product tax as well as production tax while excludes both product and production subsidies.\nBasic price: \u00a0Basic prices exclude any taxes on products the producer receives from the purchaser and passes on to the government (Eg: GST or Sales Tax or Services Tax) but include any subsidies the producer receives from government and uses to lower the prices charged to purchasers. In simple terms, basic price is the subsidized price without tax.\nGDP\n\t\nFactor Cost\n\t\nMarket Price\n\n\nConstant Price\u00a0\n\t\nGDP-CoP-FC\n\t\nGDP-CoP-MP\n\n\nCurrent Price\n\t\nGDP-CuP-FC\n\t\nGDP-CuP-MP\nGVA\nGVA is defined as the value of output less the value of intermediate consumption. For example, if the value of final output is Rs.25 and that of an intermediate product is Rs.17, then the value addition is Rs.8. The gross value addition \u2013 when value additions at all intermediate stages are calculated should be equal to the GDP, ie Rs.25.\nThe significance of GVA: Value added represents the contribution of labour and capital to the production process.\nThe connection between GDP and GVA: As an example consider the case of 1 bottle of orange juice you buy from a retail outlet for Rs. 30. As this is the money value of the final output, Rs.30\u00a0is value for GDP. The same GDP can be calculated by counting the value addition in intermediate stages too.\nGVA\u00a0is calculated usually without discounting for capital consumption or depreciation.\nWhen the value of taxes on products (less subsidies on products) is added, the sum of value added for all resident units gives the value of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nNote: GDP at market price (current prices): Under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003 and Rules thereunder, Ministry of Finance uses the GDP numbers (at current prices) to peg the fiscal targets.\n\nThe relationship between Factor Cost and Basic Prices:\u00a0Factor cost + production tax \u2013 production subsidies = Basic prices.\n\nIndian GDP series \u2013 Base Year 2004-05\nHeadline GDP: Headline GDP was GDP at factor cost.\nProducer-end given preference: GDP at market prices could have been\u00a0derived from factor cost but Indian GDP was always expressed as GDP at factor cost.\nThe relation between GDP at factor cost and GDP at market price: Indirect tax was added and subsidies were subtracted from factor cost, to obtain GDP at market price.\nIndian GDP series \u2013 Base Year 2011-12\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHeadline GDP: Headline GDP is now\u00a0GDP at market prices as per the new GDP series.\nGVA at basic prices: GDP at market prices is\u00a0derived from a new quantity ie.\u00a0Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices.\nThe relation between GVA and GDP: GVA at basic prices + (product taxes) \u2013 (product subsidies) gives GDP at market price.\nConsumer-end given importance: Earlier, domestic GDP was calculated at factor cost, which took into account prices of products received by producers. The new formula takes into account market prices paid by consumers.\nMore data from manufacturing sector: The new GDP has incorporated more comprehensive data on corporate activity and has brought more factories under its umbrella. Now,\u00a0selling and marketing expenses are also reckoned, and not\u00a0just production costs.\nGovernment\u2019s earnings, ie tax \u2013\u00a0subsidies:\u00a0Previously, in India what government received was not included in the headline GDP. Now what it earns by the indirect taxes (such as sales tax and excise duty) after deducting subsidy is also included in headline\u00a0GDP. ie GDP at constant market price.\nCriticism: The objection to this method is that the GDP figure can be manipulated by changing subsidy disbursal or by raising taxes.\nResults of the change\nTaking the old definition and base of 2004-05, India\u2019s GDP growth stood at 4.5 percent in 2012-13 and 4.7 per cent in 2013-14. However, the new Indian GDP series put GDP growth at 5.1 percent for 2012-13 and 6.9 percent for 2013-14.\nThe move towards this method of GDP calculation has brought the method in par with those used by international agencies like IMF, World Bank etc.\nProduction taxes vs Product taxes\nProduction taxes/subsidies are independent of the\u00a0quantity (volume) of production. It is often imposed even if the products are not produced (Eg: tax \u2014land revenues, stamps fees, registration fees tax on the profession; subsidies \u2014\u00a0subsidies to Railways, input subsidies to farmers, subsidies to the village and small industries, administrative subsidies to corporations or cooperatives, etc.).\nProduct taxes/subsidies depend on quantity produced. Product taxes or subsidies are paid or received on per unit of product\u00a0(Eg: tax \u2014excise tax, sales tax, service tax and import and export duties; subsidies \u2014\u00a0food, petroleum and fertiliser subsidies, interest subsidies given to farmers, households, etc)\nGDP at Factor Cost vs GVA at Basic Prices\n\nIn place of GDP at factor cost, gross value added (GVA) at basic prices will be used now.\nFor a producer, GDP at factor cost represents what he gets from the industrial activity. This can be broken down into various components \u2014 wages, profits, rents and capital \u2014 also commonly known factors of production. Aside from these costs, producers may also incur other expenses such as property tax, stamp duties and registration fees, among others.\u00a0Similarly, producers may also receive subsidies (production related) such as input subsidies to farmers and to small industries (not food or petrol subsidies that you get on the final product). It is important to note that only taxes and subsidies on intermediate inputs are adjusted.\nFor arriving at the new gross value added (GVA) at basic prices, production taxes, such as property tax, are added and subsidies are subtracted from GDP at factor cost.\nPut simply, GVA at basic price represents what accrues to the producer, before the product is sold.\nThe price paid by the consumer is not the same as the revenue received by the producer. This is because of the taxes that are paid to the government in the form of indirect taxes. Similarly, the consumer may receive subsidies on food or petrol.\nGVA at basic prices will include production taxes and exclude production subsidies available on the commodity.\nGVA at factor cost includes no taxes and excludes no subsidies.\nGDP at market prices include both production and product taxes and excludes both production and product subsidies.\nSummary\nIn simple terms, for any commodity, the basic price is the amount receivable by the producer from the consumer\u00a0for a unit of a product minus any\u00a0tax on the product\u00a0plus any\u00a0subsidy on the product.\nGDP \u2013 can be calculated as the final value of the output. It can also be calculated as the sum of value additions done in different stages to obtain the final output.\nGDP at factor cost \u2192\u00a0GVA at basic prices \u2192 GDP at market prices.\nThe objection to this method is that the GDP figure can be manipulated by changing subsidy disbursals or raising taxes\nModel Prelims Questions about the Indian GDP series\n\nQn: Which among the following is not added\u00a0while calculating GDP at market prices?\n\nA \u2013 Product tax.\nB \u2013 Product subsidy.\nC \u2013 GDP at factor cost.\nD \u2013 GVA at basic prices.\n\nRight Answer =\u00a0B \u2013 Product subsidy.\n\nQn: Which among the following statement(s) regarding India\u2019s new GDP series is/are true?\n\nGVA at basic prices is the new headline GDP.\nProduction taxes may be imposed even when the total quantity produced is zero.\nValue added represents the contribution of labour and capital to the production process.\n\nAnswer Choices:\n\nA \u2013 1 only.\nB \u2013 2 and 3 only.\nC \u2013 All the above.\nD \u2013 None of the above.\n\nRight Answer =\u00a0B \u2013 2 and 3 only.\n\nReference:\nAll about the new formula.\nIndirect taxes raise GDP.",

Therefore, foreign investment must be encouraged.\nPrice Stability and Growth:\u00a0 In a developing economy where the aim is high growth, a moderate level of inflation will have to be accepted.\u00a0 RBI must strike a balance between price stability and growth while formulating monetary policy.\nFinancial Sector Reforms:\u00a0 The recommendations of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission must be implemented immediately as they do not require any change in legislation.\u00a0 Also, a timetable must be drawn for other recommendations that require \u00a0legislation.\nInfrastructure:\u00a0 The country must rebuild its infrastructure and add a huge quantity of new infrastructure.\u00a0 Every proven model must be adopted but the \u00a0PPP model must be more widely used.\u00a0 New financing structures must be created for long term funds and pooling of investments.\n\u00a0Manufacturing:\u00a0 The Government \u00a0must focus on manufacturing and especially on manufacturing for export.\u00a0 All taxes, Central and State, that go into an exported product should be waived or rebated.\u00a0 There should be a minimum tariff protection so that there is an incentive to manufacture goods in India rather than import them into India.\n\u00a0Subsidies:\u00a0 Given the limited resources, and the many claims on the resources, the Government must choose the subsidies that are absolutely necessary and give them only to the absolutely deserving.\nUrbanization:\u00a0 The country\u2019s cities will become ungovernable, and perhaps unlivable, if attention is not paid \u00a0to\u00a0 the decay in these cities.\u00a0 Cities have wealth and also create wealth.\u00a0 But that wealth should be tapped for resources to rebuild the cities with a new model of governance.\nSkill Development:\u00a0 Skill development must rank alongside secondary education, university education, total sanitation and universal health care in the priorities of the Government.\nSharing responsibility between States and Centre:\u00a0 States have the fiscal space to bear a reasonable proportion of the financial costs of implementing flagship programmes and must willingly do so, so that the Central Government can allocate more resources for subjects such as defense, railways national highways and telecommunications that are its exclusive responsibility.\nConclusion :\n\nIn future, the fortunes of China and India will have a significant impact on the rest of the world.

    "[CONTENT] #411": "What is inflation? What are the problems associated with it? How to measure inflation rates? What are the types? Read further to know more.\n\nInflation is defined as a situation where there is a sustained, unchecked increase in the general price level and a fall in the purchasing power of money. Hence, it\u00a0is a condition of price rise.\n\nThe reason for price rise can be classified under two main heads : (1) Increase in demand and (2) Reduced supply.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInflation explained with an example\nInflation Rates in India\nHow to measure the Inflation rate?\nHeadline Inflation vs Core Inflation\nHeadline Inflation\nCore Inflation (Underline or Non-food Inflation)\nCauses of Inflation\nDemand-Pull Factors\nCost-Push Factors\nWhat measures can be taken?\nIs inflation always bad for the economy?\nInflation explained with an example\n\nSuppose for Rs.100, last week you bought 5 Kg. of rice. This means that the cost of 1 kg of rice was Rs. 20. This week when you approached the same shopkeeper and paid Rs.100 to get rice, he gave only 4 Kg of rice. He also explained that the price of rice has increased, and now it is Rs.25 per Kg.\n\nThis example clearly explains the fall in the purchasing power of money. For Rs. 100 you could get 5 Kg of rice before, but now only 4 Kg. So purchasing power of money was reduced. This is inflation.\n\nAnd let\u2019s calculate the rate (percentage). If the price of rice, which was Rs.20 per Kg increased to Rs.25, this corresponds to Rs.5 increase on Rs.20, ie. a 25% increase. So the inflation rate is 25%, which is a very high rate.\n\nInflation Rates in India\n\nThere are different indices in India like Wholesale Price Index(WPI), Consumer Price Index(CPI), etc. which measure inflation rates in India. But what we generally find in headlines is the rate in India is a rate based on WPI. In the last 50 years, the WPI-based rate shows an average inflation rate of around 7-8%.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe highest inflation rate observed in India was\u00a034.68 Percent in September of 1974. The lowest rate touched was\u00a0-11.31 Percent in May of 1976 ( a case of deflation).\n\nHow to measure the Inflation rate?\n\nUnchecked inflation can ruin the whole economy. There are many examples from African and South American economies which got shattered by the high rates. But who measures the inflation rate in India? And what are the types of Inflation indices in India? Let\u2019s study each of them.\n\nInflation can be measured at three levels \u2013 producer, wholesaler, and retailer (consumer). Prices generally rise at each level till the commodity finally reaches the hand of the consumer.\n\nInflation at the Producer Level\n\nAs of now in India, there is no index to measure inflation at the producer level. A Producer Price Index (PPI) has been proposed, but so far this type of inflation calculation has not started in India.\n\nInflation at Wholesale Level\n\nThis is the most popular rate calculation methodology in India. The index used to calculate wholesale inflation is known as Wholesale Price Index (WPI). This inflation rate is often known as headline inflation. WPI is released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.\n\nThough RBI used WPI for most of its policy decisions before 2014. However, the WPI-based inflation calculation was not false proof.\u00a0\u00a0WPI shows the combined price of a commodity basket comprising 676 items. But WPI does not include services, and it neither reflects the bottlenecks between producer and wholesaler nor between wholesaler and retailer (consumer).\n\nHence in 2014, as part of the reforms initiated by RBI governor Raghu Ram Rajan, RBI shifted to CPI for policy decisions.\n\nInflation at Retail Level (Consumer Level)\n\nThe consumer often directly buys from the retailer. So the inflation experienced at retail shops is the actual reflection of the price rise in the country. It also shows the cost of living better.\n\nIn India, the index that shows the rate at the retail level is known as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). CPI is based on 260 commodities but includes certain services too. There were four Consumer Price Indices covering different socio-economic groups in the economy.\n\nThese four indices were the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW); the Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL); the Consumer Price Index for Rural Labourers (CPI-RL) and the Consumer Price Index for Urban Non-Manual Employees (CPI-UNME).\n\nCPI is now using a new series on the base 2010=100 for all India and States/UTs separately for rural, urban, and combined. The Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation releases Consumer Price Indices (CPI). CPI is based on retail prices and this index is used to calculate the Dearness Allowance (DA) for government employees.\n\nHeadline Inflation vs Core Inflation\n\nNow let\u2019s focus on two important terms Headline and Core Inflation.\n\nHeadline Inflation\n\nIt is the measure of total inflation within an economy. It includes price rises in food, fuel, and all other commodities.\n\nThe rate expressed in Wholesale Price Index (WPI) usually denotes the headline inflation. Though Consumer Price Index (CPI) values are often higher, WPI values traditionally make headlines.\n\nCore Inflation (Underline or Non-food Inflation)\n\nIt is also a term used to denote the extent of inflation in an economy. But it does not consider the inflation in food and fuel. This is a concept derived from headline inflation. There is no index for direct measurement of core inflation and now it is measured by excluding food and fuel items from Wholesale Price Index (WPI) or Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nAlso read: Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES)\n\nCauses of Inflation\n\nThere can be two sets of factors that can cause inflation in an economy. They are Demand Pull and Cost-Push.\n\nDemand-Pull Factors\nRise in population.\nBlack money.\nRise in income.\nExcessive government expenditure.\nCost-Push Factors\nInfrastructure bottlenecks lead rise in production and distribution costs.\nRise in Minimum Support Price (MSP).\nRise in international prices.\nHoarding and black marketing.\nRise in indirect taxes.\nWhat measures can be taken?\n\nBoth the government and central bank (Reserve Bank) try to tackle inflation with their policies which are known as Fiscal and Monetary Policies respectively.\n\nFiscal policies correspond to tax-related measures taken by the government to control inflation (money supply). RBI through its various monetary policies limits the money supply by altering rates like CRR, Repo, Reverse Repo, etc.\n\nAdministrative measures taken by the government like the strengthening of the Public Distribution System also play a crucial role in curbing inflation.\n\nIs inflation always bad for the economy?\n\nThough high rates are not good for the economy, mild inflation, say under 3%, may turn, at times, useful for the economy. As we hinted in the beginning, inflation can occur because of high demand too. High demand for scarce resources will automatically increase prices.\n\nBut demand for a commodity is a good sign from the industry perspective. Industries now will try to produce more commodities to reap the benefit of high prices and demand. More production will trigger GDP growth.\n\nGlobal inflation is calculated by measuring the average price changes of a basket of goods and services across multiple countries. The process involves comparing the current prices of the selected items with their prices in a base year. The most common method used to calculate inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the changes in prices of goods and services consumed by households.\n\nAlso read\u00a0Dearness Allowance: Meaning and Types; Inflation Indexed Bonds",

(This is explained well in one of our earlier articles \u2013 basics of economy concepts).\n\nIn short,\u00a0Monetary policy refers to the use of monetary instruments under the control of the central bank to regulate magnitudes such as interest rates, money supply and availability of credit with a view to achieving the ultimate objective of economic policy.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso read: Loan Loss Provisions\n\nExpansionary and Contractionary Monetary Policy\n\nWe have already seen that monetary policy refers to the actions undertaken by a nation\u2019s central bank\u00a0to control the\u00a0money supply. Control of money supply helps to\u00a0manage inflation or deflation.\n\nThe monetary policy can be expansionary or contractionary.\n\nAn expansionary monetary policy is focused on expanding (increasing) the money supply in an economy. An expansionary monetary policy is implemented by\u00a0lowering key interest rates thus increasing market liquidity.\n\nA contractionary monetary policy is focused on contracting (decreasing) the money supply in an economy. A contractionary monetary policy is implemented by\u00a0increasing key interest rates thus reducing market liquidity.\n\nHow does the Reserve Bank of India get its mandate to conduct monetary policy?\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is vested with the responsibility of conducting monetary policy. This responsibility is explicitly mandated under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.\n\nRecently there were many changes in the way Monetary Policy of India is formed \u2013 with the introduction of Monetary Policy Framework (MPF), Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), and Monetary Policy Process (MPP). We shall see each of these terms in detail soon.\n\nWhat is the main goal of Monetary Policy of India?\n\nMaintain price stability.\n\nThe primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. Price stability is a necessary precondition for sustainable growth.\n\nTo maintain price stability, inflation needs to be controlled. The government of India sets an inflation target for every five years. RBI has an important role in the consultation process regarding inflation targeting. The current inflation-targeting framework in India is flexible in nature.\n\nAlso read: Interest Coverage Ratio \u2013 Explained with Example\n\nFlexible Inflation Targeting Framework (FITF)\n\nFlexible Inflation Targeting Framework: Now there is a flexible inflation targeting framework in India (after the 2016 amendment to the\u00a0Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934).\nWho sets the inflation target in India: The amended RBI Act provides for the inflation target to be set by the Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve Bank, once every five years.\nCurrent Inflation Target: The Central Government has notified 4 per cent Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation as the target for the period from August 5, 2016, to March 31, 2021, with the upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent and the lower tolerance limit of 2 per cent.\nFactors that constitute a failure to achieve the inflation target:\u00a0(1) the average inflation is more than the upper tolerance level of the inflation target for any three consecutive quarters, OR (2) the average inflation is less than the lower tolerance level for any three consecutive quarters.\nThe Monetary Policy Framework (MPF)\n\nWhile the Government of India sets the Flexible Inflation Targeting Framework in India, it is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which operates the Monetary Policy Framework of the country.\n\nThe amended RBI Act explicitly provides the legislative mandate to the Reserve Bank to operate the monetary policy framework of the country.\nThe framework aims at setting the policy (repo) rate based on an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, and modulation of liquidity conditions to anchor money market rates at or around the repo rate.\nNote: Repo rate changes transmit through the money market to the entire financial system, which, in turn, influences aggregate demand \u2013 a key determinant of inflation and growth.\nOnce the repo rate is announced, the operating framework designed by the Reserve Bank envisages liquidity management on a day-to-day basis through appropriate actions, which aim at anchoring the operating target \u2013 the weighted average call rate (WACR) \u2013 around the repo rate.\nMonetary Policy Committee (MPC)\n\nNow in India, the policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target is decided by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). MPC is a six-member committee constituted by the Central Government (Section 45ZB of the amended RBI Act, 1934).\n\nThe MPC is required to meet at least four times a year. The quorum for the meeting of the MPC is four members. Each member of the MPC has one vote, and in the event of an equality of votes, the Governor has a second or casting vote.\n\nThe resolution adopted by the MPC is published after the conclusion of every meeting of the MPC. Once in every six months, the Reserve Bank is required to publish a document called the Monetary Policy Report to explain: (1) the sources of inflation and(2) the forecast of inflation for 6-18 months ahead.\n\nAlso read: LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)\n\nThe present Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)\n\nThe Central Government constituted the present MPC as under:\n\nGovernor of the Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Chairperson,\u00a0ex officio;\nDeputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in charge of Monetary Policy \u2013 Member,\u00a0ex officio;\nOne officer of the Reserve Bank of India to be nominated by the Central Board \u2013 Member,\u00a0ex officio;\nShashanka Bhide, Senior advisor at National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) \u2013 Member;\nAshima Goyal, Professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research in Mumbai\u00a0\u2013 Member; and\nJayanth Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad \u2013 Member.\n\nNote: Members referred to at 4 to 6 above, will hold office for a period of four years or until further orders, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Process (MPP)\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) determines the policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target.\n\nThe Reserve Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Department (MPD) assists the MPC in formulating the monetary policy. Views of key stakeholders in the economy and analytical work of the Reserve Bank contribute to the process of arriving at the decision on the policy repo rate.\n\nThe Financial Markets Operations Department (FMOD) operationalises the monetary policy, mainly through day-to-day liquidity management operations.\n\nThe Financial Market Committee (FMC) meets daily to review the liquidity conditions so as to ensure that the operating target of monetary policy (weighted average lending rate) is kept close to the policy repo rate. This parameter is also known as\u00a0the weighted average call money rate (WACR).\n\nMonetary Policy Instruments (MPI)\n\nThere are several direct and indirect instruments that are used for implementing monetary policy.\n\nRepo Rate: The (fixed) interest rate at which the Reserve Bank provides overnight liquidity to banks against the collateral of government and other approved securities under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF).\nReverse Repo Rate: The (fixed) interest rate at which the Reserve Bank absorbs liquidity, on an overnight basis, from banks against the collateral of eligible government securities under the LAF.\nLiquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF): The LAF consists of overnight as well as term repo auctions. Progressively, the Reserve Bank has increased the proportion of liquidity injected under fine-tuning variable rate repo auctions of a range of tenors. The aim of term repo is to help develop the inter-bank term money market, which in turn can set market-based benchmarks for pricing of loans and deposits, and hence improve the transmission of monetary policy. The Reserve Bank also conducts variable interest rate reverse repo auctions, as necessitated under the market conditions.\nMarginal Standing Facility (MSF): A facility under which scheduled commercial banks can borrow an additional amount of overnight money from the Reserve Bank by dipping into their Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) portfolio up to a limit at a penal rate of interest. This provides a safety valve against unanticipated liquidity shocks to the banking system.\nCorridor: The MSF rate and reverse repo rate determine the corridor for the daily movement in the weighted average call money rate.\nBank Rate: It is the rate at which the Reserve Bank is ready to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers. The Bank Rate is published under Section 49 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. This rate has been aligned to the MSF rate and, therefore, changes automatically as and when the MSF rate changes alongside policy repo rate changes.\nCash Reserve Ratio (CRR): The average daily balance that a bank is required to maintain with the Reserve Bank as a share of such percentage of its Net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) that the Reserve Bank may notify from time to time in the Gazette of India.\nStatutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR): The share of NDTL that a bank is required to maintain in safe and liquid assets, such as unencumbered government securities, cash and gold. Changes in SLR often influence the availability of resources in the banking system for lending to the private sector.\nOpen Market Operations (OMOs): These include both, outright purchase and sale of government securities, for injection and absorption of durable liquidity, respectively.\nMarket Stabilisation Scheme (MSS): This instrument for monetary management was introduced in 2004. Surplus liquidity of a more enduring nature arising from large capital inflows is absorbed through the sale of short-dated government securities and treasury bills. The cash so mobilised is held in a separate government account with the Reserve Bank.\nSummary\n\nMonetary policy refers to the use of monetary instruments under the control of the central bank to regulate magnitudes such as interest rates, money supply and availability of credit with a view to achieving the ultimate objective of economic policy.",

When the rate of interest provided by banks keeps falling, bonds which provide a fixed interest rate for a longer duration will become more attractive. This may drive up the demand for bonds and thus may result in an increase in bond prices.\nIncrease in Foreign bond prices: Even though the demands for bonds as such may increase, the lower interest rates may make domestic bonds less attractive. So the demand for domestic bonds may fall and the demand for foreign bonds may rise.\nA decrease in the exchange rate: \u00a0Lower interest rates tend to be unattractive for foreign investment. This may decrease the currency\u2019s relative value. Reduction in interest rate may result in less foreign investment and thus less foreign currency. As the demand for domestic currency falls and the demand for the foreign currency rises, a decrease in the exchange rate may happen.\nIncrease in exports and BoP: A lower exchange rate may cause exports to increase, imports to decrease and the balance of trade to increase.\nHigher Capital Investment: Lower interest rates lead to higher levels of capital investment.\nWhat is a Contractionary Monetary Policy?\n\nA contractionary monetary policy is focused on contracting (decreasing) the money supply in an economy.\n\nThis is also known as Tight Monetary Policy.\n\nA contractionary monetary policy is implemented by increasing key interest rates thus reducing market liquidity (money supply).

This may result in a fall in the demand for bonds and thus may result in a decrease in bond prices.\nA decrease in Foreign bond prices: Even though the demands for bonds as such may fall, the higher interest rates offered in India may make foreign bonds less attractive.

In other words, it is the rate at which banks buy back the securities they keep with the RBI at a later period.\n\nThe current REPO rate is 6.25% as on December, 2022.\n\nBank gives loans to the public at a higher rate, often 1 higher than REPO rate, at a rate known as Bank Rate\u00a0(now bank rate will be 7.25%). RBI at times borrows from banks at a rate lower than REPO rate, and that rate is known as Reverse REPO rate (now 3.25%).\n\nWhat is CRR Rate?\n\nCRR corresponds to Cash Reserve Ratio. It corresponds to the percentage of cash each bank has to keep as cash reserve with RBI (in their current accounts) corresponding to the deposits they have. For example, say if State Bank of India(SBI) got a total deposit of Rs. 1 crore with them, they need to keep 3 % of that as cash reserve with RBI (around 4 lakh rupees).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNeed to reduce the CRR?\n\nThe problem with high CRR is that commercial banks lose a significant amount to be locked up in RBI lockers without getting any interest. Banks lose profit as they cannot spend this amount as loans to the public.\n\nThere was a debate regarding CRR between the SBI chief and RBI governor before. A .25% reduction in CRR will pump around 18000 crore rupees back to the banks, which they can use to give loans.\n\nWhy is there a fuss around the REPO rate cut?\n\nThere is a cry from the industrial sector to reduce the REPO rate by RBI as high REPO makes the loans which the corporates take to run their business be costly. Considering that our industrial and service sector was going through a troubled phase, with a low growth rate, a rate cut in REPO was in great demand. Lowering the REPO rate means cheap loans for the public, but that also means high liquidity in the market \u2013 so it can lead to inflation \u2013 which will turn the whole act counterproductive.\n\nWhy did RBI lower the REPO and CRR?\n\nMore than the inflation easing factor, RBI has started to give priority to the growth of the Indian economy. India\u2019s growth rate has been decreasing (now around 5%) for a couple of years, due to external and internal factors. As India\u2019s growth is mainly driven by private players, a high-interest rate (REPO) cannot do any help. The capital-intensive industries need cheap capital and for that, they need cheap loans. Growth is coupled with development in many sectors \u2013 and growth not only provides better employment but more taxes too \u2013 which can be used for social sector initiatives by the government.\n\nAlso read: Other concerns of RBI and Government: Fiscal Deficit and Current Account Deficit",

Who fixes the value of the Indian rupee as Rs.70 per 1 US dollar?\n\nLet\u2019s us discuss in this post a few confusing concepts in economics related to the currency market. \u00a0We shall see in this article, the difference between Rupee Devaluation and Rupee Depreciation.\n\nLet\u2019s also trace the value of Indian rupee with respect to US dollar from 1947 and see how a fall in rupee value affects exports and imports.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWho fixes the value of Indian Rupee against US dollar?\nFixed Rate System vs\u00a0Floating Rate System\nRupee Devaluation vs Rupee Depreciation\nHistory of Indian Rupee: A comparison of Indian Rupee Value vs US dollar\nThe value of the Indian Rupee: Does it matter?\nDepreciation and Appreciation of Indian Rupee: Relation with Exports and Imports\nExports vs Fall in the Indian Rupee Value: The local currency effect\nExports vs Fall in the Indian Rupee Value: The volume effect\nWho fixes the value of Indian Rupee against US dollar?\n\nInteresting question.

Now the value of Indian Rupee (or any other currency) is determined by the market.\n\nYes, Market!\n\nHere market means the currency market.\n\nThe demand and supply forces in the currency market determine the price of each currency.\n\nIf the demand for Indian currency is high, Indian rupee will appreciate (for example 1$ = Rs.40), and if demand is low, it will depreciate (for example, 1$ = Rs.70).\n\nIf market forces determine the value of a currency, that type of system is called Floating Rate System. India has adopted the partial floating rate system since 1975, and from 1993 is fully dependent on Floating Rate System.\n\nThis means that our Prime Minister, Finance Minister or RBI chairperson cannot fix the currency exchange rate at the click of a button. But they still have some control \u2013 through policy measures or by controlling foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFixed Rate System vs\u00a0Floating Rate System\n\nIf the government or RBI fix the exchange rate of a currency (and does not allow any variations according to demand and supply forces in the market), such a system is called the Fixed Rate system. It is also called the Bretton Woods system or Pegged Currency System.\n\nIndia was following this kind of system till 1975 and partial controls followed until 1993. Since this currency valuation mechanism is artificial, most of the countries including India changed to Floating Rate System where currency market determines the value of a currency.\n\nRupee Devaluation vs Rupee Depreciation\n\nThe term devaluation is used when the government reduces the value of a currency under Fixed-Rate System. When the value of the currency falls under the Floating Rate System, it is called depreciation.\n\nRevaluation is a term which is used when there is a rise in currency value in relation with a foreign currency in a\u00a0fixed exchange rate. In\u00a0the floating exchange rate regime, the\u00a0correct term would be\u00a0appreciation.\n\nNote: Altering the face value of a currency without changing its foreign exchange rate is a\u00a0redenomination, not a revaluation.\n\nHistory of Indian Rupee: A comparison of Indian Rupee Value vs US dollar\n\nRemember that we were following a fixed rate system till 1975. We had partial controls on currency market till 1993 when as per IMF standards we liberalized our entire economy.\n\n1947: 1 US$ = 1.00 INR (Sounds interesting, huh? :-))\n1948:\u00a01 US$ = 4.79 INR.\n1965:\u00a01 US$ = 4.79 INR.\n1966:\u00a01 US$ = 7.57\u00a0INR.\n1971:\u00a01 US$ = \u00a08.39\u00a0INR.\n1985:\u00a01 US$ = \u00a012.0 INR.\n1991:\u00a01 US$ = \u00a017.9 INR.\n1993:\u00a01 US$ = \u00a031.7 INR.\n2000: 1 US$ = 45.0 INR.\n2013: 1 US$ = 60.0 INR.\n2017: 1 US$ = 65.0 INR.\n2018:\u00a01 US$ = 74.0 INR.\nThe value of the Indian Rupee: Does it matter?\n\nIt should not be forgotten that the exchange rate of a currency is not really an indicator of the economic strength of a country.\n\nThere are many countries including China which favours the devaluation of the currency.\n\nAlso, the economic position of India in 2017 is far better than that of 1947, though there is a fall in Rupee value.\n\nAt present what should worry the Finance Minister and RBI governor should not the falling Indian Rupee, but the fluctuations in the currency market. What India needs is stabilization of Indian Rupee value, be in Rs. 50, Rs.60 or Rs.70 per 1 US dollar. But if rupee is Rs.60 one day and if it Rs. 65 the next day, it shows high volatility. Such a situation is not good for the economy and that will only trigger more fall in Indian rupee.\n\nDepreciation and Appreciation of Indian Rupee: Relation with Exports and Imports\n\nUPSC has often asked this question \u2013 directly and indirectly \u2013 how does a fall in rupee affects exports and imports? Wait, before analyzing this topic let\u2019s see one more question \ud83d\ude42\u00a0Why do governments devalue their currencies?\n\nAnswer: They do it mainly to improve the balance of trade (or in other words, to increase exports and decrease imports!).\n\nExports vs Fall in the Indian Rupee Value: The local currency effect\n\nA devaluation means that more local currency is needed to purchase imports and exporters get more local currency when they convert the export proceeds (the foreign exchange that they get for their exports).\n\nIn other words: imports become more expensive; importers lose money while exporters earn more money.\n\nThis is supposed to discourage imports \u2013 and to encourage exports and, in turn, to reduce trade deficits.\n\nClear, uh?\n\nWell, that was an explanation with respect to the local currency angle. Let\u2019s see the same case analyzing the volume effect angle as well.\n\nExports vs Fall in the Indian Rupee Value: The volume effect\n\nAssume that India is the exporting country and America as the importing country. India exports apples to America. Assume that India devalued India rupee from Rs. 50 =1 dollar to Rs.100 = 1 dollar. The cost of an apple in India before and after rupee devaluation is Rs.50. Now analyze what will happen.\n\nBefore rupee devaluation: Americans will get only 1 apple for 1 dollar.\nAfter rupee devaluation: Now Americans will get 2 apples for 1 dollar.\n\nThink from the American perspective. For them earlier with 1$, they used to get only 1 apple. Now after falling in Indian rupee, they get 2 apples.\n\nSo importing from India has become really cheaper for America and they will use this case to their maximum advantage.\n\nThis case will favour exporters in India in two ways:\n\n(1) They can now sell more apples (volume effect), trade volume will increase.\n(2) Indian currency they get when converted is now higher than before. (It was Rs.50 before, now it is Rs.100 \u2013 for 1 US$ received)\n\nThus, every time there is a fall in rupee against US dollar, exporters from India are benefited.

In this post, we will see what UPI is and how safe is to use UPI.\n\nIn February 2024, NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) in partnership with Lyra, a French leader in securing e-commerce and proximity payments,\nannounced acceptance of the UPI payment mechanism in France.\n\nFrance became the first European country to accept the Unified Payment Interface.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is UPI?\nBut how is UPI different from netbanking (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS)?\nWhy UPI?\nWho developed the Unified Payment Interface?\n6 Steps to Start Using UPI\nWhat is MPIN?\nHow exactly does one make a payment transaction?\nHow safe is the Unified Payment Interface?\nWhat kind of transactions can be performed via UPI?\nAre there any limitations regarding the amount that can be transferred in a single transaction?\nUPI Payment Service Providers: Banks vs Wallets\nThe Significance of Unified Payment Interface\nOk, so far good. Any negatives?\nWhat is UPI?\n\nUnified Payment Interface (UPI) is a newly introduced platform to transfer money between any two bank accounts in India, by avoiding the existing complexities.\n\nUnified Payment Interface is an indigenous payment system that works with the help of a smartphone.\n\nBut how is UPI different from netbanking (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS)?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUnified Payment Interface is standardized across banks, which means you can initiate a bank account transfer from anywhere with a few clicks. This means that UPI will help you to pay directly from your bank account to different merchants without the hassle of typing your net banking password, credit card details, or IFSC code.\nApart from cards, net banking, and wallets, you can now pay through UPI too.\nUnified Payment Interface allows paying someone as well as \u2018collecting\u2019 cash from someone.\nWhy UPI?\nEven after introducing net banking in India, the number of cash transactions happening in India is very high (almost 95% of all transactions).\nUnified Payment Interface is part of RBI\u2019s efforts towards \u2018Less Cash\u2019 India.\nWho developed the Unified Payment Interface?\n\nUnified Payment Interface was developed by the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) under the guidelines of RBI. UPI is based on the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) platform.\n\nAlso read: Paytm Payments Bank Debacle\n\n6 Steps to Start Using UPI\n\nUnified Payment Interface is now publicly available. Check if your bank has released an updated mobile app with UPI support already.\n\nDownload the UPI app of your bank from Google Play Store/Apple Apps Store and install it on your phone.\nSet app login.\nCreate a Virtual Payment Address (VPA). Eg: Roychoudary@icici\nAdd your bank account.\nSet MPIN.\nStart transacting using UPI.\nWhat is MPIN?\n\nAn MPIN is given to a banking customer once they register for Mobile Banking support. Chances are you have one already but have never used it.\n\nHow exactly does one make a payment transaction?\n\nFor example, consider that you are trying to book tickets online for a film via your mobile.\n\nWhen you\u00a0click to buy, the mobile website/ mobile app you used will trigger the UPI payment link. Now, you are\u00a0taken to the pay screen of the UPI app. Here,\u00a0the transaction information is verified and a click followed by entry of a secure PIN completes the purchase.\n\nAlso read: History of Banking in India\n\nHow safe is the Unified Payment Interface?\n\nIt is safe as the customers only share a virtual address and provide no other sensitive information.\u00a0The\u00a0\u2018virtual payment address\u2019 is an alias to your bank account.\n\nThe virtual payment addresses don\u2019t allow your security to be compromised when a certain merchant\u2019s account is hacked, because their database will have only a list of virtual addresses. The payment addresses are denoted by \u2018account@payment_service_provider\u2019.\n\nIt offers better security than other payment methods where details like credit card numbers are sent. While using Unified Payment Interface, all these details are hidden as only a Virtual Payment Address (VPA) is used.\n\nWhat kind of transactions can be performed via UPI?\n\nMerchant payments, remittances, and bill payments among others.\n\nAre there any limitations regarding the amount that can be transferred in a single transaction?\n\nThe per transaction limit is Rs.1 lakh.\n\nUPI Payment Service Providers: Banks vs Wallets\nUPI Apps (UPI Service Providers)\n\nCurrently, Unified Payment Interface has permitted only banks to be registered as Payment Service Providers (which means they can run bank accounts).

As you know, bank deposits are also money.\n\nFor different calculations, different components are included as \u2018money\u2019.\n\nDefinition of Money Supply\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMoney Supply can be defined as the money circulating in an economy.\n\nAs money supply is connected with \u2018circulating money\u2019, only the highly-liquid forms of money like currency and bank deposits are usually considered.\n\nMoney Supply is measured and expressed using different monetary aggregates like M1, M2, M3, M4 etc.\n\nTerms like Narrow Money and Broad Money are also used to denote money supply.\n\nMoney Supply \u2013 In layman\u2019s terms\n\nThe money supply is the total stock of money circulating in an economy. In the most simple language, Money Supply is Currency in Circulation plus Deposits in Commercial\u00a0Banks.\n\nMoney supply consists of:\n\ntotal currency circulating in the public plus\nthe non-bank deposits with a commercial bank.\n\nMoney supply includes deposits generated in the banking system resulting from a multiplier effect of movement of currency in the banking system as well as other forms of liquid assets.\n\nWhat is meant by \u2018currency in circulation\u2019?\n\nIt is the total value of the currency (coins and paper currency) that has ever been issued by the Reserve Bank of India minus the amount that has been withdrawn by it.\n\nCurrency in circulation (currency with the public) comprises of:\n\ncurrency notes and coins with the public\ncash in hand with banks.\n\nIt is a major liability component of a central bank\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nMoney Aggregates: Standard Measures of Money Supply\n\nIn short, there are two types of money.\n\nCentral bank money\u00a0(M0) \u2013 obligations of a central bank, including currency and central bank depository accounts.\nCommercial bank money (M1 and M3)\u00a0\u2013 obligations of commercial banks, including current accounts and savings accounts.\n\nIn the money supply statistics, central bank money is M0 while the commercial bank money is divided up into the M1 and M3 components. M2 and M4 components also include Post-Office deposits as well.\n\nGenerally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of M1 while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized in M2 and M3. M3 is the largest of all money aggregates (M1-M3).\n\nNote: In this article, we cover the Monetary Aggregates as per the old convention (M1, M2, M3, and M4). In the new convention, aggregates are represented as NM1, NM2, and NM3. This is covered in detail in the ClearIAS article on the new monetary aggregates.\n\nReserve Money (M0):\n\nReserve money is also called central bank money, monetary base, base money, or high-powered money. It is the base level for the money supply or the high-powered component of the money supply.\n\nIn the most simple language, Reserve Money is Currency in Circulation plus Deposits of Commercial Banks with RBI.\u00a0\n\nMo\n\n= Currency in circulation + Bankers\u2019 deposits with the RBI + \u2018Other\u2019 deposits with the RBI\n= Net RBI credit to the Government + RBI credit to the commercial sector + RBI\u2019s claims on banks + RBI\u2019s net foreign assets + Government\u2019s currency liabilities to the public \u2013 RBI\u2019s net non-monetary liabilities.\nM1 (Narrow Money)\n=Currency with the public + Deposit money of the public (Demand deposits with the banking system + \u2018Other\u2019 deposits with the RBI).\nM2:\n=M1 + Savings deposits with Post office savings banks.\nM3: (Broad Money)\n= M1+ Time deposits with the banking system\n= Net bank credit to the Government + Bank credit to the commercial sector + Net foreign exchange assets of the banking sector + Government\u2019s currency liabilities to the public \u2013 Net non-monetary liabilities of the banking sector (Other than Time Deposits).\nM4:\n=M3 + All deposits with post office savings banks (excluding National Savings Certificates).\nMoney Multiplier (m)\n\nA money multiplier is an approach used to demonstrate the maximum amount of broad money that could be created by commercial banks for a given fixed amount of base money and reserve ratio.\n\nThe money multiplier, m, is the inverse of the reserve requirement, R:\nFor example, with the reserve ratio of 20 per cent, this reserve ratio, R, can also be expressed as a fraction:\nSo then the money multiplier, m, will be calculated as:\n\nThis number is multiplied by the amount of reserves to estimate the maximum potential amount of the money supply. For example, from Rs.100 can be multiplied by 5 to generate Rs.500 money supply if Reserve Ratio is 1/5 (20%) or when Money Multiplier is 5. When Reserve Ratio is 1/4 (25%) or when Money Multiplier is 4, that would generate only Rs. 400 as money supply.\n\nMoney Supply (M3) vs Monetary Base (Mo)\n\nReserve Money (Mo) is also called the monetary base. As mentioned earlier, it denotes the money of RBI. Mo includes Currency in Circulation and Bank\u2019s Reserves.\n\nEven though the money supply can be denoted either as M1 or M3, usually when we speak of money supply, we intend M3. M3 includes Currency in Circulation and Checkable Bank\u2019s Deposits.\n\nDemonetisation and its effect on Money Supply (M3) and Reserve Money (Mo)\n\nDid the government\u2019s move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes improve the balance sheet of Reserve Bank of India (RBI)? To understand this scenario, we must learn the interplay of currency, reserve money and money supply.\n\nWhen a currency note of a particular denomination ceases to be legal tender, the central bank\u2019s liabilities are reduced to that extent and also the amount of currency in circulation declines.\n\nOn November 8, 2016 Government of India made Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes invalid. This meant that Rs. 15.41 lakh crore worth of high-value legal tender was withdrawn from circulation.\n\nSo, the entire liability of Rs. 15.41 lakh crore due to Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes in circulation was nullified.\n\nBut the demonetisation impact is neutralised when the demonetised currency is replaced with new accepted currency notes. You may note that, even if an individual chooses to park the cash as deposits with banks, it forms a part of the overall money supply.\n\nThe RBI report after demonetisation had mentioned that 99.3% of all demonetised currency returned to the banking system. The figure was 15.31 lakh crore.\n\nAs 15.31 lakh crore again became part of the RBI, now the net-liability of RBI = Rs.15.41 lakh crore \u2013 Rs.15.31 lakh crore = Rs.0.10 lakh crore.\n\nThis figure (Rs. 10000 crore) was only a nominal reduction in liability, offset by printing and transportation cost of the new currency, which led many experts to point out that the demonetisation experiment was a failure to curb black money. Many criticised the government that it over-estimated the black money in the country.\n\nWhat if the demonetisation was a success?\n\nIf there was a lot of black money in the country, and people choose not to declare and surrender their high-denomination currency notes, then RBI would have gained to the extent that its currency liabilities are lowered.\n\nThe gains it makes in the process could have been transferred to its reserves and then appropriated in its profit and loss account. This would have given it leeway to transfer higher amounts as dividends to the government.\n\nHowever, this scenario didn\u2019t happen.\n\nWhy is the currency in circulation a liability to RBI or government?\n\nLet us examine what is the status of the currency we hold in our hands.\n\nSection 26 of\u00a0the Reserve bank of India Act 1934 (\u201cRBI Act\u201d) states as follows:\n(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), every banknote shall be legal tender at any place in India in payment or on account for the amount expressed therein and shall be guaranteed by the Central Government.\n\nThis means that the money the public hold in hand or in the bank is a debt guaranteed by the government (to us). The currency thus represents a \u2018public debt\u2019 owed by the government to the holders of the banknotes \u2013 the public.",

In fact, and a sense, the Urban Co-Operative Banks (UCBs), the Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), and Local Area Banks (LABs) could be considered differentiated banks as they operate in localized areas.\n\nHowever, the present concept of differentiated banks can be said to have been first discussed in 2007. Thereafter, the concept was once again discussed in the Paper \u201cBanking Structure in India \u2013 The Way Forward\u201d, brought out by the Reserve Bank in August 2013. RBI granted in-principle approvals to 11 entities for setting up payments banks (PBs) in August 2015 and 10 for Small Finance Bank (SFB) in September 2015.\n\nSmall Finance Banks (SFBs)\nThey are niche banks that focus on and serve the needs of a certain demographic segment of the population.\nThe objectives of setting up small finance banks will be to further financial inclusion by (1) the provision of savings vehicles (2) supply of credit to small business units; small and marginal farmers; micro and small industries; and other unorganised sector entities, through high technology-low cost operations.\nSFBs were recommended by the NachiketMor committee on financial inclusion.\nScope of activities of SFBs\nThe small finance banks shall primarily undertake basic banking activities of acceptance of deposits and lending to unserved and underserved sections including small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries, and unorganized sector entities.\nThere will not be any restrictions in the area of operations of small finance banks.\nCriteria for setting up SFBs\nIndividuals/professionals with 10 years of experience in finance, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), microfinance companies, and local area banks are eligible to set up SFBs.\nThe minimum paid-up equity capital for small finance banks shall be Rs. 100 crore.\nThe promoter\u2019s minimum initial contribution to the paid-up equity capital of such a small finance bank shall at least be 40 percent and gradually brought down to 26 percent within 12 years from the date of commencement of business of the bank.\nThe foreign shareholding in the small finance bank would be as per the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy for private sector banks as amended from time to time.\nThe small finance banks will be required to extend 75 percent of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) to the sectors eligible for classification as priority sector lending (PSL) by the Reserve Bank.\nSFBs have to maintain the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) as per RBI norms.\nAt least 50 percent of its loan portfolio should constitute loans and advances of up to Rs. 25 lakh.\nWhat can SFBs do?\nSell forex to customers.\nSell mutual funds, insurance, and pensions.\nCan convert into a full-fledged bank.\nWhat Small Finance Banks can\u2019t do?\nExtend large loans.\nCannot float subsidiaries and deal in sophisticated products.\nChallenges to Small Finance Banks\nHave to compete with existing public sector banks and RRBs.\nMicro Finance Institutions (MFI)/NBFCs specialize in micro-lending operations with limited exposure to banking operations; which means they have to hire and train talent from the banking industry.\nThe cost of deposit mobilization will be higher for these banks as they cover rural and underserved segments.\nPayment Banks\nThe objectives of setting up payment banks will be to further financial inclusion by providing (1) small savings accounts and (2) payments/remittance services to migrant labor workforce, low-income households, small businesses, other unorganized sector entities, and other users.\nThey will not lend to customers and will have to deploy their funds in government papers and bank deposits.\nScope of activities\nAcceptance of demand deposits-Payments bank will initially be restricted to holding a maximum balance of Rs. 100,000 per individual customer.\nIssuance of ATM/debit cards-Payments banks, however, cannot issue credit cards.\nPayments and remittance services through various channels.\nBusiness Correspondents (BC) of another bank, subject to the Reserve Bank guidelines on BCs.\nDistribution of non-risk sharing simple financial products like mutual fund units and insurance products, etc.\nThe payment bank cannot undertake lending activities.\nCriteria for setting up Payment banks\nExisting non-bank Pre-paid Payment Instrument (PPI) issuers;

that are owned and controlled by residents; and public sector entities may apply to set up payments banks.\nPromoter/promoter groups should be \u2018fit and proper\u2019 with a sound track record of professional experience or run their businesses for at least five years to be eligible to promote payment banks.\nThe minimum paid-up equity capital for small finance banks shall be Rs. 100 crore.\nMaintains a minimum of 75% of deposits in Government bonds and a maximum of 25% deposits with other scheduled commercial banks.\nThe promoter\u2019s minimum initial contribution to the paid-up equity capital of such payments bank shall at least be 40 percent for the first five years from the commencement of its business.\nThe bank should have a high-powered Customer Grievances Cell to handle customer complaints.\nThe operations of the bank should be fully networked and technology-driven from the beginning, conforming to generally accepted standards and norms.\nWhat can Payment Banks do?\nOffer internet banking, and sell mutual funds, insurance, and pensions.\nHave business correspondents and ATMs.\nOffer bill payment service for customers\nThey can enable transfers and remittances from a mobile phone.\nThey can offer forex services at charges lower than bank\nThey can provide forex cards to travelers, usable as debit or ATM cards all over India.\nThey can also offer card acceptance mechanisms to third parties such as \u201cApple Pay\u201d.\nWhat Payment Banks can\u2019t do?\nOffer credit cards\nExtend loans\nHandle cross-border remittances\nAccept NRI deposits\nChallenges for payment banks\nLow revenue can\u2019t undertake any lending businesses and the income stream is initially restricted to charges on remittances and efficiency of operations.\nRequired to invest a minimum of 75 percent of its \u201cdemand deposit balances\u201d into government securities. This limits their ability to earn from the deposit base as well.\nBanks are already offering most services that payments banks can and hence, for payments banks to offer a new and differentiated proposition will not be easy.\nOther saving instruments like Kisan Vikas Patra, gold bonds, etc have better returns than payment banks.\nExperience from Jan Dhan Yojna has shown that many such no-frill accounts have remained dormant, thus affecting the viability of the banks.\nPayment Banks vs Small Finance Banks\n\nImage courtesy: Times of India\n\nNewly Proposed Differentiated Banks\n\nIn addition to recently licensed differentiated banks such as payments banks and small finance banks, the Reserve Bank has been exploring the possibilities of licensing other differentiated banks such as custodian banks and banks concentrating on wholesale and long-term financing.\n\nCustodian banks: Custodian Banks are specialized financial institutions mainly responsible for safeguarding a firm\u2019s or individual\u2019s financial assets and are typically not engaged in conventional retail lending.\n\nWholesale banks: Wholesale banks are lenders that cater to large corporates that require long-term finance, particularly those engaged in infrastructure development. Typically, these banks raise long-term funds which are exempted from maintaining regulatory requirements like cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio.\n\nSummary and Way Forward\n\nImage Courtesy: Business Standard\n\nBoth Payments Banks and Small Finance Banks are \u2018niche\u2019 or \u2018differentiated\u2019 banks with the common objective of furthering financial inclusion.\nIndia\u2019s domestic remittance market is estimated to be about Rs 800-900 billion and growing. With money transfers made possible through mobile phones, a big chunk of it, especially that of the migrant labor could shift to this new platform.\nPayment banks can also play a significant role in implementing the government Direct Benefit Transfer scheme, where subsidies on health care, education, and gas are paid directly to beneficiaries\u2019 accounts.\nPayment banks have proved hugely popular in other developing countries. In Kenya, the most cited success story, Vodafone M-Pesa is used by two in three adults to store money, make purchases, and transfer funds to friends, relatives, etc.\n\nRead: \u00a0Paytm Payments Bank Debacle\n\nArticle by: Arun Kumar.

Like other banks, cooperative banks are founded by collecting funds through shares, accepting deposits, and granting loans.\n\nThey are Cooperative credit societies where members from a community group together to extend loans to each other, at favorable terms.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThey are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act of the State concerned or the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002.\n\nThe Cooperative banks are governed by the Banking Regulations Act, 1949 and Banking Laws (Cooperative Societies) Act, 1955.\n\nThey are broadly divided into urban and rural cooperative banks.\n\nFeatures of cooperative banks:\nCustomer Owned: Cooperative bank members are both the customer and owner of the bank. These banks are owned and controlled by the members, who democratically elect a board of directors.\nProfit Allocation: A significant part of the yearly profit, benefits, or surplus is usually allocated to constitute reserves and a part of this profit can also be distributed to the cooperative members, with legal and statutory limitations.\nFinancial Inclusion: They have played a significant role in the financial inclusion of unbanked rural masses. They provide cheap credit to the masses in rural areas.\nWhat are Urban Cooperative banks (UCB)?\n\nThe term Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) is not formally defined but refers to primary cooperative banks located in urban and semi-urban areas.\n\nThe Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), the Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), and Local Area Banks (LABs) could be considered as differentiated banks as they operate in localized areas.\n\nTill 1996, these banks were allowed to lend money only for non-agricultural purposes. This distinction does not hold today.\n\nThese banks were traditionally centred on communities and local workgroups as they essentially lent to small borrowers and businesses. Today, their scope of operations has widened considerably.\n\nHistory of Urban Cooperative Banks\n\nThe inspiration for UCB was the success of the experiments related to the cooperative movement in Britain and the cooperative credit movement in Germany. The origins of the urban cooperative banking movement in India can be traced back to the 19th century when such societies were first set up in India.\n\nCooperative societies are based on the principles of cooperation, mutual help, democratic decision-making, and open membership. Cooperatives represented a new and alternative approach to organization as against proprietary firms, partnership firms, and joint-stock companies which represent the dominant form of commercial organization.\n\nThe first known mutual aid society in India was the \u2018Anyonya Sahakari Mandali\u2019 organized in the erstwhile princely State of Baroda in 1889 under the guidance of Vithal Laxman also known as Bhausaheb Kavthekar.\n\nThe enactment of the Cooperative Credit Societies Act, 1904 gave the real impetus to the movement. The first urban cooperative credit society was registered in Canjeevaram (Kanjivaram) in the erstwhile Madras province in October 1904.\n\nThe most prominent amongst the early credit societies was the Bombay Urban Co-operative Credit Society, sponsored by Vithaldas Thackersey and Lallubhai Samaldas established on January 23, 1906.\n\nThe Maclagan Committee of 1915 was appointed to review their performance and suggest measures for strengthening them. The committee observed that such institutions were suited to cater to the needs of the lower and middle-income classes of society and would encourage the principles of banking amongst the middle classes.\n\nThe Government of India Act in 1919 transferred the subject of \u201cCooperation\u201d from the Government of India to the Provincial Governments.\n\nThe Cooperative Planning Committee (1946) and The Rural Banking Enquiry Committee (1950) recommended the establishment of such banks even in places smaller than taluka towns.\n\nThe first study of Urban Cooperative Banks was taken up by RBI in 1958-59. The Report published in 1961 acknowledged the widespread and financially sound framework of urban cooperative banks and emphasized the need to establish primary urban cooperative banks in new centers and suggested that State Governments lend active support to their development.\n\nRecent developments related to UCB\n\nIn January 2020, the RBI\u00a0revised the Supervisory action Framework (SAF) for UCBs.\n\nIn June 2020, the Central government approved an Ordinance to bring all urban and multi-state cooperative banks under the direct supervision of RBI.\n\nMost recently RBI appointed a committee that suggested 4 tier structure for the UCBs.\n\nTier 1 with all unit UCBs and salary earner\u2019s UCBs (irrespective of deposit size) and all other UCBs having deposits up to Rs 100 crore,\nTier 2 with UCBs of deposits between Rs 100 crore and Rs 1,000 crore,\nTier 3 with UCBs of deposits between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore and\nTier 4 with UCBs of deposits more than Rs 10,000 crore.\nChallenges faced by cooperative banks:\n1. Changing financial sector trends:\n\nChanges in the financial sector and evolving microfinance, FinTech companies, payment gateways, social platforms, e-commerce companies, and NBFCs challenge the continued presence of the UCBs, which are mostly small in size, lack professional management, and have geographically less diversified operations.\n\n2. The decline in deposits and loans:\n\nThe collapses in the management have led to people losing trust in cooperative banks slowly.\n\n3. Declining contributions:\n\nA report noted that despite a crucial role played by the sector, its share in total agricultural lending diminished considerably over the years from as high as 64% in 1992-93 to just 11.3 % in 2019-20.\n\n4. Declining numbers:\n\nAfter liberalization in licensing policy of 1993, nearly one-third of the newly licensed ones became financially unsound. In 2005, RBI merged the weaker ones together into one unit.\n\n5. Dual control:\n\nThe UCBs were under dual regulation by the state registrar of societies and the RBI. But in 2020, all UCBs and multi-state cooperatives were brought under the supervision of RBI.\n\nWay forward:\n\nThe establishment of the country\u2019s dedicated Ministry of Cooperation is a crucial moment for the history of the cooperative movement.\n\nNow, the establishment of a standard regulatory and supervisory framework, and an umbrella organization, should be given top importance in the advancement of UCBs.\n\nThe RBI is should interpret the Act\u2019s provisions so that they do not disrupt UCBs and people\u2019s faith is restored in the cooperative banking system.",

Indian Banking industry is seriously affected by Non-Performing Assets.\n\nIn the best interest of our readers, we have come up with a comprehensive post on NPAs, in which analyze the entire issue in detail.\n\nWe will also list out the steps taken by the Government and RBI to counter the situation.\n\nAlso read: Infrastructure and Economic Development\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a Non-Performing Asset (NPA)?\nAn example of NPA:\nNPAs definition by Reserve Bank of India (RBI)\nTechnical definition by RBI on NPA on different cases\nCategories of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)\nHow serious is India\u2019s NPA issue?\nWhat can be the possible reasons for NPAs?\nWhat is the impact of NPAs?\nWhat are the various steps taken to tackle NPAs?\nThe Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) \u2013 1993\nCredit Information Bureau \u2013 2000\nLok Adalats \u2013 2001\nCompromise Settlement \u2013 2001\nSARFAESI Act \u2013 2002\nARC (Asset Reconstruction Companies)\nCorporate Debt Restructuring \u2013 2005\n5:25 rule \u2013 2014\nJoint Lenders Forum \u2013 2014\nMission Indradhanush \u2013 2015\nStrategic debt restructuring (SDR) \u2013 2015\nAsset Quality Review \u2013 2015\nSustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A) \u2013 2016\nInsolvency and Bankruptcy code Act-2016\nPubic ARC vs. Private ARC \u2013 2017\nBad Banks \u2013 2017\nSummary\nWhat is a Non-Performing Asset (NPA)?\nYou may note that for a bank, the loans given by the bank is considered as its assets. So if the principle or the interest or both the components of a loan is not being serviced to the lender (bank), then it would be considered as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA).\nAny asset which stops giving returns to its investors for a specified period of time is known as Non-Performing Asset (NPA).\nGenerally, that specified period of time is 90 days in most of the countries and across the various lending institutions. However, it is not a thumb rule and it may vary with the terms and conditions agreed upon by the financial institution and the borrower.\nAn example of NPA:\n\nSuppose the State Bank of India (SBI) gives a loan of Rs. 10 crores to a company (Eg: Kingfisher Airlines). Consider that they agreed upon for an interest rate of say 10% per annum. Now suppose that initially everything was good and the market forces were working in support to the airline industry, therefore, Kingfisher was able to service the interest amount. Later, due to administrative, technical or corporate reasons suppose the company is not able to pay the interest rates for 90 days. In that case, a loan given to the Kingfisher Airlines is a good case for the consideration as NPA.\n\nAlso read: Loan Loss Provisions\n\nNPAs definition by Reserve Bank of India (RBI)\nAn asset, including a leased asset, becomes non\u00adperforming when it ceases to generate income for the bank.\nTechnical definition by RBI on NPA on different cases\n\nNPA is a loan or an advance where\u2026\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nInterest and/ or instalment of principal remain overdue for a period of more than 90 days in respect of a term loan.\nThe account remains \u2018out of order\u2019 in respect of an Overdraft/Cash Credit (OD/CC).\nThe bill remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in the case of bills purchased and discounted.\nThe instalment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for two crop seasons for short duration crops.\nThe instalment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for one crop season for long duration crops.\nThe amount of liquidity facility remains outstanding for more than 90 days, in respect of a securitisation transaction undertaken in terms of guidelines on securitisation dated February 1, 2006.\nIn respect of derivative transactions, the overdue receivables representing positive mark-to-market value of a derivative contract, if these remain unpaid for a period of 90 days from the specified due date for payment.\nCategories of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)\n\nBased upon the period to which a loan has remained as NPA, it is classified into 3 types:\n\nCategories of NPAs\n\t\nCriteria\n\n\nSubstandard Assets\n\t\nAn asset which remains as NPAs for less than or equal to 12 months.\n\n\nDoubtful Assets\n\t\nAn asset which remained in the above category for 12 months.\n\n\nLoss Assets\n\t\nAsset where loss has been identified by the bank or the RBI, however, there may be some value remaining in it. Therefore loan has not been not completely written off.\nHow serious is India\u2019s NPA issue?\n\nMore than Rs. 7 lakh crore worth loans are classified as Non-Performing Loans in India. This is a huge amount.\nThe figure roughly translates to near 10% of all loans given.\nThis means that about 10% of loans are never paid back, resulting in substantial loss of money to the banks.\nWhen restructured and unrecognised assets are added the total stress would be 15-20% of total loans.\nNPA crisis in India is set to worsen.\nRestructuring norms are being misused.\nThis bad performance is not a good sign and can result in crashing of banks as happened in the sub-prime crisis of 2008 in the United States of America.\nAlso, the NPA problem in India is worst when comparing other emerging economies in BRICS.\n\nWhat can be the possible reasons for NPAs?\nDiversification of funds to unrelated business/fraud.\nLapses due to diligence.\nBusines losses due to changes in business/regulatory environment.\nLack of morale, particularly after government schemes which had written off loans.\nGlobal, regional or national financial crisis which results in erosion of margins and profits of companies, therefore, stressing their balance sheet which finally results into non-servicing of interest and loan payments. (For example, the 2008 global financial crisis).\nThe general slowdown of entire economy for example after 2011 there was a slowdown in the Indian economy which resulted in the faster growth of NPAs.\nThe slowdown in a specific industrial segment, therefore, companies in that area bear the heat and some may become NPAs.\nUnplanned expansion of corporate houses during the boom period and loan taken at low rates later being serviced at high rates, therefore, resulting in NPAs.\nDue to mal-administration by the corporates, for example, willful defaulters.\nDue to misgovernance and policy paralysis which hampers the timeline and speed of projects, therefore, loans become NPAs. For example the Infrastructure Sector.\nSevere competition in any particular market segment. For example the Telecom sector in India.\nDelay in land acquisition due to social, political, cultural and environmental reasons.\nA bad lending practice which is a non-transparent way of giving loans.\nDue to natural reasons such as floods, droughts, disease outbreak, earthquakes, tsunami etc.\nCheap import due to dumping leads to business loss of domestic companies. For example the Steel sector in India.\nWhat is the impact of NPAs?\nLenders suffer a lowering of profit margins.\nStress in banking sector causes less money available to fund other projects, therefore, negative impact on the larger national economy.\nHigher interest rates by the banks to maintain the profit margin.\nRedirecting funds from the good projects to the bad ones.\nAs investments got stuck, it may result in\u00a0it may result in unemployment.\nIn the case of public sector banks, the bad health of banks means a bad return for a shareholder which means that the government of India gets less money as a dividend. Therefore it may impact easy deployment of money for social and infrastructure development and results in social and political cost.\nInvestors do not get rightful returns.\nBalance sheet syndrome of Indian characteristics that is both the banks and the corporate sector have stressed balance sheet and causes halting of the investment-led development process.\nNPAs related cases add more pressure to already pending cases with the judiciary.\nWhat are the various steps taken to tackle NPAs?\n\nNPAs story is not new in India and there have been several steps taken by the GOI on legal, financial, policy level reforms. In the year 1991, Narsimham committee recommended many reforms to tackle NPAs. Some of them were implemented.\n\nThe Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) \u2013 1993\n\nTo decrease the time required for settling cases. They are governed by the provisions of the Recovery of Debt Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993. However, their number is not sufficient therefore they also suffer from time lag and cases are pending for more than 2-3 years in many areas.\n\nCredit Information Bureau \u2013 2000\n\nA good information system is required to prevent loan falling into bad hands and therefore prevention of NPAs. It helps banks by maintaining and sharing data of individual defaulters and willful defaulters.\n\nLok Adalats \u2013 2001\n\nThey are helpful in tackling and recovery of small loans however they are limited up to 5 lakh rupees loans only by the RBI guidelines issued in 2001. They are positive in the sense that they avoid more cases into the legal system.\n\nCompromise Settlement \u2013 2001\n\nIt provides a simple mechanism for recovery of NPA for the advances below Rs. 10 Crores. It covers lawsuits with courts and DRTs (Debt Recovery Tribunals) however willful default and fraud cases are excluded.\n\nSARFAESI Act \u2013 2002\n\nThe Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 \u2013 The Act permits Banks / Financial Institutions to recover their NPAs without the involvement of the Court, through acquiring and disposing of the secured assets in NPA accounts with an outstanding amount of Rs. 1 lakh and above. The banks have to first issue a notice. Then, on the borrower\u2019s failure to repay, they can:\n\nTake ownership of security and/or\nControl over the management of the borrowing concern.\nAppoint a person to manage the concern.\n\nFurther, this act has been amended last year to make its enforcement faster.\n\nARC (Asset Reconstruction Companies)\n\nThe RBI gave license to 14 new ARCs recently after the amendment of the SARFAESI Act of 2002. These companies are created to unlock value from stressed loans. Before this law came, lenders could enforce their security interests only through courts, which was a time-consuming process.\n\nCorporate Debt Restructuring \u2013 2005\n\nIt is for reducing the burden of the debts on the company by decreasing the rates paid and increasing the time the company has to pay the obligation back.\n\n5:25 rule \u2013 2014\n\nAlso known as, Flexible Structuring of Long Term Project Loans to Infrastructure and Core Industries. It was proposed to maintain the cash flow of such companies since the project timeline is long and they do not get the money back into their books for a long time, therefore, the requirement of loans at every 5-7 years and thus refinancing for long term projects.\n\nJoint Lenders Forum \u2013 2014\n\nIt was created by the inclusion of all PSBs whose loans have become stressed. It is present so as to avoid loan to the same individual or company from different banks. It is formulated to prevent the instances where one person takes a loan from one bank to give a loan of the other bank.\n\nMission Indradhanush \u2013 2015\n\nThe Indradhanush framework for transforming the PSBs represents the most comprehensive reform effort undertaken since banking nationalization in the year 1970 to revamp the Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and improve their overall performance by ABCDEFG.\n\nA-Appointments: Based upon global best practices and as per the guidelines in the companies act, separate post of Chairman and Managing Director and the CEO will get the designation of MD & CEO and there would be another person who would be appointed as non-Executive Chairman of PSBs.\n\nB-Bank Board Bureau: The BBB will be a body of eminent professionals and officials, which will replace the Appointments Board for the appointment of Whole-time Directors as well as non-Executive Chairman of PSBs\n\nC-Capitalization:\u00a0As per finance ministry, the capital requirement of extra capital for the next four years up to FY 2019 is likely to be about Rs.1,80,000 crore out of which 70000 crores will be provided by the GOI and the rest PSBs will have to raise from the market.\n\nFinancial Year\n\t\nTotal Amount\n\n\nFY15-16\n\t\n25,000 Crore\n\n\nFY16-17\n\t\n25,000 Crore\n\n\nFY17-18\n\t\n10,000 Crore\n\n\nFY18-19\n\t\n10,000 Crore\n\n\nTotal\n\t\n70,000 Crore\n\nD-DEstressing:\u00a0PSBs and strengthening risk control measures and NPAs disclosure.\n\nE-Employment:\u00a0GOI has said there will be no interference from Government and Banks are encouraged to take independent decisions keeping in mind the commercial the organizational interests.\n\nF-Framework of Accountability:\u00a0New KPI(key performance indicators) which would be linked with performance and also the consideration of ESOPs for top management PSBs.\n\nG-Governance Reforms: For Example, Gyan Sangam, a conclave of PSBs and financial institutions. Bank board Bureau for transparent and meritorious appointments in PSBs.\n\nStrategic debt restructuring (SDR) \u2013 2015\n\nUnder this scheme banks who have given loans to a corporate borrower gets the right to convert the complete or part of their loans into equity shares in the loan taken company. Its basic purpose is to ensure that more stake of promoters in reviving stressed accounts and providing banks with enhanced capabilities for initiating a change of ownership in appropriate cases.\n\nAsset Quality Review \u2013 2015\n\nClassify stressed assets and provisioning for them so as the secure the future of the banks and further early identification of the assets and prevent them from becoming stressed by appropriate action.\n\nSustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A) \u2013 2016\n\nIt has been formulated as an optional framework for the resolution of largely stressed accounts. It involves the determination of sustainable debt level for a stressed borrower and bifurcation of the outstanding debt into sustainable debt and equity/quasi-equity instruments which are expected to provide upside to the lenders when the borrower turns around.\n\nInsolvency and Bankruptcy code Act-2016\n\nIt has been formulated to tackle the Chakravyuaha Challenge (Economic Survey) of the exit problem in India. The aim of this law is to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit, and balance the interests of all stakeholders by consolidating and amending the laws relating to reorganization and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time-bound manner and for maximization of value of assets of such persons and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\n\nPubic ARC vs. Private ARC \u2013 2017\n\nThis debate is recently in the news which is about the idea of a Public Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARC) fully funded and administered by the government as mooted by this year\u2019s Economic Survey Vs. the private ARC as advocated by the deputy governor of RBI Mr. Viral Acharya. Economic survey calls it as PARA (Public Asset Rehabilitation Agency) and the recommendation is based on a similar agency being used during the East Asian crisis of 1997 which was a success.\n\nBad Banks \u2013 2017\n\nEconomic survey 16-17, also talks about the formation of a bad bank which will take all the stressed loans and it will tackle it according to flexible rules and mechanism. It will ease the balance sheet of PSBs giving them the space to fund new projects and continue the funding of development projects.\n\nSummary\n\nThe need of the hour to tackle NPAs is some urgent remedial measures. This should include:\n\nTechnology and data analytics to identify the early warning signals.\nMechanism to identify the hidden NPAs.\nDevelopment of internal skills for credit assessment.\nForensic audits to understand the intent of the borrower.\n\nArticle by: Nishant\u00a0Raj.

One with Indian companies and the other with Indian Banks.\n\nThus, TBS is two two-fold problem for Indian economy which deals with:\n\nOverleveraged companies\u00a0\u2013 Debt accumulation on companies is very high and thus they are unable to pay interest payments on loans. Note: 40% of corporate debt is owed by companies who are not earning enough to pay back their interest payments. In technical terms, this means that they have an interest coverage ratio less than 1.\n\u00a0Bad-loan-encumbered-banks \u2013\u00a0Non Performing Assets (NPA) of the banks is 9% for the total banking system of India. It is as high as 12.1% for Public Sector Banks. As companies fail to pay back principal or interest, banks are also in trouble.\nOrigin of Twin Balance Sheet Problem in India\n\nOrigin of TBS problem can be traced to the 2000s when the economy was on an upward trajectory.\nDuring that time, the investment-GDP ratio had soared by 11% reaching over 38% in 2007-08. Thus non-food bank credit doubled and capital inflows in 2007-08 reached 9% of GDP. Due to such a boom in the economy, firms started taking risks and abandoned their conservative debt/equity ratios and leveraged themselves up to take advantage of the upcoming opportunities.\nBut Global Financial Crisis (2007-08) reduced growth rates and thus revenues from the investment. Projects that had been built around the assumption that growth would continue at double digit levels were suddenly confronted with growth rates half that level.\nFirms that borrowed domestically suffered when RBI increased interest rates to avoid inflation increasing financial costs.\nEnvironment and land clearances in infrastructure sector delayed the projects.\nThus higher cost, lower revenues, greater financial costs-all squeezed corporate cash flow leading to NPAs in the banking sector.\nPeculiarities of India\u2019s Twin Balance Sheet Problem (TBS):\nIn other countries, corporates over expand during the boom and accumulate obligations which they find difficult to repay. It leads to default and the situation is reached where high NPA levels have triggered banking crises.\nIn India, there have been no bank runs, no stress in the interbank market, no need for any liquidity support and GDP growing at a good pace since the TBS problem first emerged in 2010. Yet the problem has reached to this scale where it threatens the stability of the entire banking system.\nThe reason for this is that major NPAs are concentrated in Public Sector Banks which have the full backing of the government.\nEarlier steps to address the problem of NPA or TBS\n\nIndia had taken different steps to tackle the NPA or TBS problem which already covered in a different article. Insolvency and Bankruptcy code too was in the same direction. Briefing the important schemes again.\n\n1. 5/25 Refinancing of Infrastructure Scheme\nThis scheme offered a larger window for the revival of stressed assets in the infrastructure sector and eight core industry sectors.\nUnder this scheme, lenders were allowed to extend amortisation periods to 25 years with interest rates adjusted every 5 years, so as to match the funding period with the long gestation and productive life of these projects.\nThe scheme thus aimed to improve the credit profile and liquidity position of borrowers, while allowing banks to treat these loans as standard in their balance sheets, reducing provisioning costs.\nIssues faced: However, with amortisation spread out over a longer period, this arrangement also meant that the companies faced a higher interest burden, which they found difficult to repay, forcing banks to extend additional loans (\u2018evergreening\u2019). This, in turn, has aggravated the initial problem.\n2. Private Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)\nARCs acquire NPAs from banks or financial institutions and try to resolve them.\nARCs are a product of and derive their asset resolution powers from the SARFAESI Act.\nThe issue faced: ARCs have found it difficult to recover much from the debtors. Thus they have only been able to offer low prices to banks, prices which banks have found it difficult to accept.\n3. The Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) scheme\nThe SDR scheme was introduced in June 2015, under which banks could take over firms that were unable to pay and sell them to new owners.\nThe issue faced: By December 2016, only two sales have been materialised as many firms remained financially unviable.\n4. Asset Quality Review (AQR)\nThe RBI emphasised AQR, to verify that banks were assessing loans in line with RBI loan classification rules. Any deviations from such rules were to be rectified by March 2016.\n5. The Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A)\nAn independent agency hired by the banks will decide on how much of the stressed debt of a company is sustainable. The rest (unsustainable) will be converted into equity and preference share.\nThe issue faced: Only one case has been solved under this scheme so far.\nWhy did the above measures fail to solve the TBS problem?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nLoss recognition: Banks do not recognise stressed assets and continue giving loans. They are reluctant to conduct the asset quality review for their assets.\nCoordination problems: Difficulty in deciding compensation by different banks on Joint Lenders Forums which has not achieved much success.\nCourt cases: Public Sector Banks are reluctant to write down loans as bank managers are afraid of accusation of favouritism.\nLack of Capital: Indradhanush Scheme promised to infuse Rs 70,000 crore into Public Sector Banks by 2018-19. But this amount is not enough and banks need atleastRs 1.8 lakh crore more.\nQuestions over the sustainability of Indian strategy: Phoenix Scenario vs Containment Scenario\nThe Indian strategy is based on the two scenarios:\n1. Phoenix Scenario \u2013 Growth will decrease the bad debt by raising demand and investment cycle.\n2. Containment Scenario \u2013 In this case, one needs to contain the bad loans in nominal terms and slowly their share would reduce in bank sheets.\nEarlier both scenarios seemed feasible but now they are failing as per the recent data. So some new innovative methods are needed to resolve this problem.\nWhat is the solution to the Twin Balance Sheet Problem?\n\nIndia has till now pursued a decentralised approach where individual banks have taken decisions on its own to resolve NPAs. This approach has not resolved the problem and time have now come to create a centralised agency called Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency (PARA).\n\nWhy does India need a\u00a0Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency (PARA)?\n\nIt will be able to resolve not only NPA problems but also bad debts of the companies, thus resolving TBS Problem.\nThe centralised agency would help in fixing the problem faster and the decision will be taken swiftly.\nIt could solve the coordination problem since debts would be centralised in one agency.\nThe stressed debt is heavily concentrated in large companies and such bigger cases can be resolved by an independent agency.\nFailure of Banks and private ARCs in resolving NPA problem till now.\nAn international experience like of East Asian countries has shown that centralised agency can resolve Twin Bet Problem.\nWorking of PARA\nPARA would purchase loans from banks and then work them by different ways like converting debt to equity and selling the stakes in the auction.\nAfter taking off the loans from Public Sector Banks, the government would recapitalize them. Similarly, once the financial viability of the over-indebted enterprises is restored, they will be able to focus on their operations, rather than their finances and will be able to consider new investments.\nFunding of PARA\nRBI may transfer some of the government securities to PARA.\nGovernment funding in the form of securities.\nRest of the money may come from capital markets.\nConclusion\n\nTwin Balance Sheet Problem (TBS) is a major problem that Indian economy is facing today. The past mechanisms of resolving this problem in the form of decentralised approach have failed. There is no point of delaying this problem because the delay is very costly for the economy as impaired banks are scaling back their credit while the stressed companies are cutting their investments. The time has come to adopt the strategy that East Asia adopted during their crises period. The centralised agency in the form of PARA would allow debt problems to be worked out quickly. The time has come for India to consider the same approach.\n\nArticle by: Rahul Sharma, UPSC Topper 2016, With All India Rank 76",

It shows the underperformance and poor financial health of the company.\n\nAlso read: LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)\n\nWhat is the significance of the Interest Coverage Ratio?\n\nCompanies need to have good profits to cover interest payments.\n\nA high-Interest Coverage Ratio is advised to meet its interest obligations and in order to survive future financial hardships (that may arise).\n\nIf a company has a low-interest coverage ratio, there\u2019s a high chance that the company won\u2019t be able to service its debt. This will put the firm at risk of insolvency or bankruptcy.\n\nFirms with an interest coverage ratio lower than one are unable to meet their interest obligations from their income. Such firms are categorized as zombies.\n\nUnproductive firms popularly referred to as \u201czombies\u201d are typically identified using the interest coverage ratio.\n\nSignificance of Interest Coverage Ratio with respect to Indian Companies and Banking System\n\nThe Indian Banking system is recently criticized for the loans given to companies that repeatedly fail to pay back interest or principal.\n\nUpon studying the interest coverage ratio of various companies, it is clear that banks gave loans to zombies without much consideration leading to the Non-Performing Asset (NPA) or bad loan crisis.\n\nEconomic Survey 2020-2021 points out that the share of new loans to zombie firms increased from 5% in 2007-08 to a whopping 27% in 2014-15.\n\nThe share of new loans sanctioned to zombie firms whose interest coverage ratio lies in the bottom quartile is found to increase from 20% in 2007-08 to 43% in 2014-15.\n\nHowever, as the Twin Balance Sheet problem became a major news item, the Reserve Bank of India took strict measures to address the Non-Performing Assets issue.

The bank was founded by Rana Kapoor and Ashok Kapur.\n\nThe bank engaged in highrisk lending, providing loans to those who could not raise funds elsewhere.\n\nThe assets books of Yes bank showed promising growth until 2017 when the problem of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) came into the highlight.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHow big is YES Bank?\n\nYES bank is currently India\u2019s fifth-largest private sector lender.\n\nYes bank had deposits of Rs. 2 lakh crore. Its total assets including loans given are Rs.3.5 lakh crore.\n\nThe bank has 18000+ employees and has more than 1100 branches and 1300 ATMs.\n\nYES Bank Crisis\n\nLoans not repaid is a major issue of most banks in India. These bad loans are called Non-Performing Assets (NPA). The Gross Non-Performing Assets of YES Bank was 7.4% of the gross advances at the end of September 2019. It became 18.87 per cent of the bank\u2019s total loan book (or Rs 40,709.20 crore) at the end of December 2019.\n\nThe crisis at YES Bank started when the huge NPA issue at YES Bank became public.\n\nFor the quarter ended December 2019, Yes Bank reported a loss of Rs 18,564 crore compared to a profit of Rs 1001 crore in the same quarter in 2018. The bank\u2019s net loss would have been wider at Rs 24,778 crore in the third quarter if it weren\u2019t for a tax write-back of Rs 6,214 crore. In the preceding quarter, Yes Bank had reported a net loss of Rs 600 crore.\n\nBad loans\n\nThe founder Rana Kapoor had personal connections with most of the high-level industrialists who sought his help for loans, which went not repaid. Some of the big defaulters to whom the bank had advanced funds included IL&FS, Anil Ambani group, CG Power, Cox & Kings, Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day, Essel group, Essar Power, Vardaraj Cement, Radius Developers, and Mantri Group.\n\nThe Bad loans of Yes Bank are estimated to be around Rs.40000 crore (Gross NPA). While the Gross NPA was around 19% of advances, Net NPA was around 6% of loans at the end of December 2019.\n\nEroded capital base\n\nThe overall capital adequacy ratio dropped to 4.2 per cent from 16.3 per cent in the preceding quarter.\n\nThe capital base \u2013 specifically the Core Equity Tier-1 ratio \u2013 fell to 0.6 per cent at the end of the quarter compared to 8.7 per cent in the September quarter. The minimum regulatory requirement stands at 7.375 per cent.\n\nBreach of RBI mandated ratios\n\nYES bank\u2019s statutory liquidity ratio has breached the RBI\u2019s minimum requirement and so has its liquidity coverage ratio. The bank has thus provided Rs 86 crore as a penalty to the central bank.\n\nGovernance Issue: Under-reporting of NPAs\n\nIt is not just that Yes Bank had NPAs, but it under-reported NPAs which was later found out by RBI. This led to the end of the tenure of the founder Rana Kapoor as the CEO (2018).\n\nDeposits vs Loans\n\nIn the last five years, the loan book grew by over four times, but deposits failed to keep pace with loan growth. The loan book grew to \u20b92,24,505 crore as of September 2019, while deposits were at only at \u20b92,09,497 crore.\n\nUnusual increase in loans given from FY 2014 \u2013 FY 2019\n\nAs per news reports, the loan book of Yes Bank had grown from Rs. 55,000 crore in FY 2014 to Rs. 2,41,000 core in FY 2019. When overall bank credit during the above period grew only by about 10 per cent, it unusual to notice that YES Bank\u2019s loan book grow by about 35 per cent.\n\nRumours spread through social media\n\nRumours spread through social media about the possible collapse of Yes Bank when it was capable of managing its balance sheet, added fuel to the fire. Many false news and rumours resulted in shrinking of the deposit base of YES bank.\n\nAs on Dec. 31, 2019, the bank\u2019s outstanding deposit base stood reduced to 1.65 lakh crore from Rs 2.09 lakh crore on Sep. 30, 2019. The lender continues to see an outflow of deposits since Dec. 31; its total deposits stood at Rs 1.37 lakh crore, as on Mar. 5.\n\nThe bank\u2019s failure to raise fresh capital\n\nAs the bank had a lot of bad loans (in the tune of Rs.10,000+ crore), it needed fresh capital to manage its operations. The bank\u2019s failure to raise capital led to rating downgrades, which made capital-raising even more difficult.\n\nRBI moratorium\n\nAll the above factors led the RBI to conclude that there was no \u201ccredible revival plan\u201d from the end of YES bank and so \u201cin the public interest and the interest of the bank\u2019s depositors\u201d there was \u201cno alternative\u201d but to place the bank under a moratorium.\n\nRBI to took over from YES bank board for 30 days. The central bank has appointed deputy managing director and chief finance officer of State Bank of India, Prashant Kumar, as an administrator of the bank.\n\nThe Central Bank of India then imposed limits on withdrawals to protect depositors.\n\nReserve Bank of India under Sub-section (1) of Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Government of India has made an Order of Moratorium in respect of Yes Bank Ltd. under Sub-section (2) of the said Section for the period from 5th day of March 2020 and up to and inclusive of the 3rd day of April 2020.\n\nYes Bank Ltd. Reconstruction Scheme, 2020\n\nReserve Bank of India (RBI) stated that State Bank of India (SBI) has expressed its willingness to make an investment in Yes Bank Ltd. and participate in its reconstruction scheme. Therefore, as per the of the powers conferred by sub-section (4) of section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Reserve Bank of India, proposed the details of the scheme for raising fresh capital for Yes Bank.\n\nThe authorised capital of the Reconstructed bank\n\nAs per the government notification, the Authorised Capital of the Reconstructed Yes Bank shall stand altered to Rs. 6200 crore from the Rs.1100 crore earlier. The number of equity shares will stand altered to 3000\u00a0crore. The capital of the reconstructed bank at Rs.2 face value per share would be Rs. 6000 crores.\n\nAuthorised preference share capital shall continue to be Rs 200 crore.\n\nHow much should the investor bank invest?\n\nThe investor bank (Eg: SBI) can purchase up to 49% in the reconstructed YES bank. The investor bank should purchase each share at price not less than Rs.10 (ie at a premium of Rs.8).\n\nSo, if SBI is purchasing 49% of 3000 crore YES Bank shares at Rs.10 per share, that would mean it will be investing Rs.14700 crores to purchase 1470 crore shares of the private bank. SBI had approved an investment of Rs 7,250 crore in Yes Bank by purchasing 725 crore equity shares.\n\nPS: The Main Investor bank (SBI) is not allowed to reduce its holding below 26% before completion of three years from the date of infusion of the capital.\n\nNew Investors in YES Bank\n\nApart from SBI, YES Bank got a lot of new investors as well.\n\nICICI Bank and Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd announced that they will be investing Rs 1,000 crore each in Yes Bank\u2019s equity. Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank will be investing Rs 600 crore and Rs 500 crore respectively. Bandhan Bank will be investing Rs 300 crore.\n\nExisting shareholders own 255 crore shares, and they will end up with a roughly 8.5% stake in the company.\n\nThe balance 41.5% stake will presumably be held by other institutions and investors, who will need to infuse roughly \u20b9 12450 crores, assuming the acquisition price is \u20b9 10 per share.\n\nExpected total new investment in YES Bank\n\nThe total new investment expected in YES bank in the near future from SBI and other investors in the company is expected to be at least Rs.27150 crore.\n\nWriting down of AT-1 bonds\n\nIn a separate disclosure made to exchanges, Yes Bank said that the additional tier-1 bonds issued by the lender would need to be written down since the bank has reached the \u2018point of non-viability\u2019 trigger.\n\nAs per Basel rules, AT-1 bonds are loss-absorbing capital instruments and should be written down when a bank breaches certain thresholds of core equity tier-1 capital.\n\nThe bank has Rs 8,415 crore in such bonds outstanding.\n\nIs the new deal a merger of YES Bank with SBI?\n\nNo.\n\nThe current deal is not a merger with SBI rather an equity investment by SBI in YES BANK.\n\nPS: Merger with SBI is also a promising deal for YES Bank and its depositors. However, the merger of the private bank with the state bank is something which would be worked out only if the current investment deal does not bring the desired results.\n\nWill YES Bank be shut down?\n\nNo.\n\nThe government or RBI has no plans to do that. The deal is not even a merger scheme, but a plan to revive the private bank to its old glory.\n\nIs the Yes Bank Crisis over?\n\nHopefully yes, if the reconstruction scheme is properly implemented.\n\nFrom the depositors perspective, their hard-earned money may get locked up for a few more weeks. However, as assured by the Finance Minister, their deposits will be protected.\n\nOnce the reconstructed bank resumes its operations, and gets backs the loans given, gradually YES bank may be back to normal. All we can do now is to wait and watch.\n\nYES Bank-SBI Deal\n\nSBI board has given in-principle approval of exploring the possibility of picking up a stake of up to 49 per cent in Yes Bank. The draft plan is out. However, the deal is not finalised yet.\n\nThe best possible Scheme for the reconstruction of YES Bank\n\nThe SBI investment in Yes Bank is the best deal the capital-thirsty private bank can ask for. The presence of a credible name like SBI is very important for a resolution.\n\nIf the deal goes as per plan, depositors of YES Bank are in safe hands and have nothing to worry about. The survival of YES Bank is critical to preventing a contagion in the banking industry.\n\nRajnish Kumar, SBI chairman sounded confident of implementing the restructuring proposal for YES Bank before the 30-day RBI imposed moratorium period ends. Once YES Bank was out of moratorium it would be run by a professional team.\n\nMain Stake Holders\nDepositors in YES Bank\nInvestors in YES Bank (shareholders)\nInvestors in SBI (shareholders)\n\nThe primary objective of RBI or government in a crisis like that of YES Bank is to safeguard the hard-earned money of depositors. RBI assured depositors of the bank that their interests will be fully protected and there is no need to panic.\n\nThe next priority is to safeguard the interest of investors (shareholders), however, this does not seem to be easy.\n\nYes bank\u2019s shareholders would surely be the biggest losers. Going by the experience of banks placed under moratorium earlier by RBI, shareholders are unlikely to be compensated.\n\nShares of Yes Bank, which traded at 404 rupees at its peak in August 2019, fell to a record low of 5.65 rupees on March 2020, with the stock plunging nearly 85%.\n\nMost of the shareholders of YES bank will be happy to see a credible investor like SBI investing heavily in YES Bank. However, the shareholders of SBI is worried about the top public sector bank\u2019s investment in a loss-making private bank, which may not give any immediate returns.\n\nThe issue of conflict of interest in SBI Investment in Yes Bank\n\nWill there be a conflict of interest when a public sector bank invests in a private sector bank? Will the SBI pull-out customers of Yes Bank into its database? Will deposits move out from YES Bank to SBI.\n\nSBI chairman believes that there is no conflict of interest.\n\nThe plan is to keep YES Bank and SBI separate, leaving scope for the state-run lender to exit the investment when YES bank turns profitable.\n\nThough the new board of Yes Bank will be constituted with two nominees from SBI to build the trust of investors and depositors, SBI management would not be involved in the day-to-day management of the private lender.\nThe solution for YES Bank Crisis\n\nSBI should take over the loan book of YES Bank, recover the loans, and return the depositors money.\n\nThe new draft scheme proposes full repayment of all deposits, dilution of equity, and write-off of Rs 10,800 crore of additional tier one (AT-1) bonds.\n\nYES Bank and RBI\nRBI Governor Shaktikanta Das IAS\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) already facing criticism on major supervision lapses in cases like Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC), couldn\u2019t have afforded Yes Bank to fail.\n\nYes Bank Crisis: Why RBI missed seeing the signs?\n\nReserve Bank of India did notice pressure points as early as 2017, which eventually led to the regulator denying extension to the then MD & CEO Rana Kapoor, despite the board\u2019s endorsement.\n\nHowever, RBI failed to come up with a concrete step like pooling SBI into the scheme of things until things became worse.\n\nIf the government and RBI acted earlier, they could have gained the confidence of depositors and retained much of the money. Also, the painful steps like moratorium and restriction on the withdrawal \u2013 which results in the loss of people\u2019s confidence in the economy \u2013 could have been avoided if they acted earlier.\n\nYes Bank Crisis: It is time to reform RBI?\n\nRBI is burdened with too many responsibilities.\n\nThe government must reduce the RBI\u2019s responsibilities so that the central bank can focus on the key areas.\n\nA few suggestions: The securities regulation should move to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI); debt management should be given to an independent debt management agency, and infrastructure systems operated by RBI should be corporatised.\n\nAs mentioned before, a specialised independent mechanism (resolution authority) should be directly monitoring the performance issues of banks like Yes Bank. Most of the G-20 countries have built specialised capabilities to resolve failed financial firms. Such a mechanism can keep a check on the regulator\u2019s tendency to delay recognition of failure, thereby ensuring quick and orderly resolution.\n\nWilful Default vs Non-Wilful Default\n\nBank robbery is an initiative of amateurs. True professionals establish a bank. \u2014 Bertolt Brecht.\n\nThe government and RBI should analyse the default in the case of loans taken by corporates is willful or not.\n\nIf it is wilful, a detailed investigation should be done regarding the background of the tie-ups between Yes Bank and its corporate clients. An enquiry should be conducted regarding indiscriminate lending and fund usage in the last 3 years \u2013 when the investment climate was utterly gloomy that only a few genuine companies were seeking loans for fresh investment.\n\nIf it is not wilful, the root cause lies in the pain points in the economy which should be identified and corrected.\n\nBank Crisis and Bailouts in India\n\nThe bailout is the act of giving financial assistance to a failing business to save it from collapse.\n\nIn India, how many banks have failed?\n\nIn India, no scheduled commercial bank has been allowed to collapse (or fail) since 1991.\n\nThe central bank and the government have always made sure that a failing bank gets acquired before it drowns.\n\nOnly cooperative banks have failed here. As per figures from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), authority that provides deposit insurance in the country, the cases of about 350 such banks have been settled so far for a payout of Rs 4,822 crore in claims.\n\nRBI will not allow any scheduled commercial bank to fail\n\nIn India, most of the scheduled commercial banks are considered entities which are \u2018too big to fail\u2019.\n\nA previous example is the case of Global Trust Bank. Global Trust Bank was merged with Oriental Bank of Commerce to avoid failure.\n\nDepositors will not lose money\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, and SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar had assured that the money of depositors will be safe.\n\nIn the recent past, there are no instances in India where depositors lost money in case of a scheduled bank collapse.\n\nMoratorium by RBI and its impact\n\nThe market was enthusiastic with the news of SBI intervention as an investor in Yes Bank. However, the moratorium (temporary prohibition of an activity) and equity dilution plan shocked investors and depositors alike.\n\nProbably the moratorium was needed to prevent further erosion of deposits because of any rumours or insider news.\n\nOnce the reconstructed YES bank starts functioning, the banking process should hopefully be back to normal. There might be a delay for depositors to get their money back, however, this should not mean losing any hard-earned money.\n\nPrivate Bank vs Public Sector Bank: Which is safe?\n\nPublic Sector Banks have 51% or more of the government equity stake in it. However, with respect to the safety net of depositors, private banks and the public sector banks are almost the same.\n\nIf a bank fails, the maximum insurance amount is limited to Rs.5 lakh per account for both private bank and public sector bank.\n\nHowever, be it a private or public sector bank, government and RBI would normally intervene much before the bank goes beyond redemption. The resolution may be in the form of additional equity or a merger with a stronger bank.\n\nRBI norms to protect depositors from a bank collapse\n\nScheduled commercial banks include private banks and public sector banks. Both are supervised and regulated by RBI. They have the same norms as well.\n\nThey cannot lend the entire money that they have received from depositors: 4 per cent of these deposits has to be kept aside as cash reserve ratio (CRR) and 18.75 per cent as the statutory liquid ratio (SLR).\n\nAlso, these banks have to maintain adequate capital when compared with risky loans given. This requirement is known as the capital adequacy ratio (capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio [CRAR]). CRAR is currently at 9 per cent.\n\nHas any bank of YES bank\u2019s size failed in India in the past?\n\nApart from co-operative banks, no scheduled commercial bank in modern India has failed to result in loss of depositor money.\n\nRBI has always stepped in to bail out ailing banks \u2013 often merging it with another stronger bank or infusing extra capital, and thus protecting the depositor money.\n\nThis is the first time the central bank has taken such drastic action like moratorium with respect to a big bank like Yes Bank.\n\nA near similar instance was in July 2004 when the RBI got state-run Oriental Bank of Commerce to take over Global Trust Bank to rescue the private sector lender.\n\nRecent Bank Bailouts\n\nRecent examples:\n\nIDBI Bank Crisis \u2013 In 2018, the government got LIC to bail out IDBI Bank with a Rs 21,624 crore capital infusion.\nPNB Bank Crisis \u2013 In 2018, the government paid the scam-hit Punjab National Bank (PNB) Rs 2,816 crore as a capital infusion from the via a preferential allotment of equity shares.\nPMC Bank Crisis \u2013 In 2019, the Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Limited was been put under restrictions by RBI, after an alleged Rs 4,355 crore scam came to light. PMC bank may be merged with Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank in the near future.\nWhich will be the next bank that will be in crisis?\n\nNobody can be sure of any bank.\n\nThe balance sheets of other banks too may be inflated, like what happened with YES bank. Only an independent and efficient audit check can find out the real issues.\n\nRBI needs to more cautious with the scrutiny of the balance sheet of private and public sector banks.\n\nIs it a good idea to bail out private banks using taxpayers money?\n\nIn this case of reconstruction of Yes Bank, which is a private bank, the investment from State Bank of India (a public sector bank) will be used. Public Sector Banks like SBI has 51% government\u2019s share \u2013 which is taxpayers money.\n\nThere are many who raise concerns in wasting taxpayers\u2019 money to bail out failing private entities. This quick remedy of government\u2019s indirect investment in private firms is also against the current principle of the State exiting from even public firms.\n\nHowever, considering no other alternative now, this bailout should be seen as an exception rather than the rule.\n\nShould RBI keep on bailing out ailing banks?\n\nWhen the\u00a0cost of not bailing out an ailing bank for the economy and banking system is far higher than bailing out, this looks to be the only option.\n\nIf a bank collapse ruining depositors money, the repercussions will be huge.\n\nThat will not be limited to the banking sector but will affect the economy as a whole. It will also have social and political ramifications.\n\nBanking Sector Reforms\nSBI chairman Rajnish Kumar addressing media regarding banking reforms connected with Yes Bank\n\nIndian Banking Sector is going through a tough time. It\u2019s time for immediate reforms like the merger of banks, bank resolution authority etc. Also, the root cause of the NPA issue should be identified and properly addressed.\n\nProper Solution to the Twin Balance Sheet Problem (TBS)\n\nPrevious Economic Surveys of India had already talked about the twin balance sheet problem of India.\n\nThe problem of banks is often not a balance sheet problem at the bank\u2019s end alone. It is also a problem of the corporates to which it gave loans.\n\nWhy are the corporates not repaying the loans-taken?\n\nEvery time, it may not be a wilful default.\n\nThe government policies, rules, regulations, or even Supreme Court judgments might be the bottle-necks for corporate houses to run a business smoothly, earn a profit, and repay the loan.\n\nDeposit Insurance\n\nIndia is one of the countries that offer the lowest protection to depositors in cases of a bank failure. Whatever be the deposit in the bank account, only deposits up to Rs.5 lakh is covered by deposit insurance. (Budget 2020)\n\nDeposit Insurance should be increased further to increase trust in the banking system.\n\nIn India, deposit insurance is provided by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RBI. DICGC collects a premium of 0.05% on the entire outstanding deposit from banks (and not from depositors).\n\nThe need for a resolution authority\n\nA Resolution Authority is needed to take over failing banks and either run them temporarily, sell them, infuse equity or, as a last resort, liquidate them.\n\nFRDI Bill\n\nFinancial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill was introduced in Parliament in 2017 to create a Resolution Authority. Unfortunately, it got mired in controversy. To address concerns with the Bill, the Union Budget 2020-21 raised the deposit insurance cap to Rs 5 lakh.\n\nThe Finance Minister has subsequently announced that the FRDI Bill will be brought back to Parliament. The Yes Bank moratorium should help put the bill on a fast track.\n\nMerger of Banks\n\nTo strengthen the Indian Banking sector, the Central Government of India has announced the merger of ten public sector banks into four banks.\n\nAfter the merger of banks, the country will have 12 public sector banks instead of 27.\n\nConclusion\n\nYes Bank was one of the highest-rated new generation private banks until 2017 when the bank started to face serious bad loan issue.\n\nTo stabilise the bank, Yes Bank Ltd. Reconstruction Scheme, 2020 was introduced by the Reserve Bank of India. RBI had also imposed temporary restrictions regarding the withdrawal of deposits.\n\nSBI board has given in-principle approval of exploring the possibility of picking up a stake of up to 49 per cent in Yes Bank. However, the deal is not finalised yet.\n\nTo protect the depositors, the bank must be quickly reconstructed. Also, steps should be taken to liquidate the NPAs. If Yes Bank is resolved effectively, it will protect Yes Bank\u2019s depositors, and maintain trust in the entire banking system.",

Recently, the Reserve Bank of India tried \u2018Operation Twist\u2019 in India.\n\nOriginally, \u2018Operation Twist\u2019 was the name given to the US Federal Reserve monetary policy operation. This operation involved the purchase and sale of government securities to boost the economy by bringing down long-term interest rates.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, the Reserve Bank of India conducted its version of \u2018Operation Twist\u2019 through simultaneous purchase and sale of government securities under Open Market Operations (OMOs).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Operation Twist?\nWhat is the Yield of Government Securities?\nWhat happens when RBI goes for bulk buying of long-term government bonds?\nExplanation of the \u2018Yield of Bonds\u2019 with an example\nBenefits of bringing down the long term interest rates\nWhy Operation Twist is necessary? Why Can\u2019t RBI directly reduce the interest rates?\n7 Key Points to Understand about Operation Twist\nWhich topic do you want ClearIAS to prepare the next concept explainers?\nWhat is Operation Twist?\n\nOperation Twist is the operation by which the Reserve Bank of India twists the \u2018yield of government securities\u2019 \u2013 particularly the yield of long-term government securities with respect to short term government securities.\n\nUnder Operation Twist, the RBI will buy long term bonds of the government and at the same time sell short term securities of the government.\n\nBuying long term securities and selling short term securities will reduce the yield of long term securities compared to that of the short term ones. This yield impact is the objective of Operation Twist.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is the Yield of Government Securities?\n\nThe term yield denotes the benefit or interest-rate a Government Security (Eg: Government Bonds or Treasury Bills) provide.\n\nFor example, a Government Bond of Rs.1000 provides an interest of Rs.100 per year, it\u2019s yield percentage is 10%.\n\nWhat happens when RBI goes for bulk buying of long-term government bonds?\n\nWhen RBI goes for bulk purchase of long-term government bond, it will create a big demand in the market.\n\nAs a result, the price of long-term bonds will increase.\n\nWhen the price of bonds increases, the yield (interest rate) of the long-term bonds decrease. This is because the price of the bonds and yield of the bonds are inversely proportional.\n\nThus, with simultaneous buying of long-term bonds and selling of short-term securities, RBI can bring down the interest rates of long-term government securities.\n\nExplanation of the \u2018Yield of Bonds\u2019 with an example\n\nThe purpose of operation twist is to bring down the interest rate of long-term government securities.\n\nSuppose that, before undertaking Operation Twist, the yield of long term government securities with an original price of Rs.1000 was 10%.\n\nNow, as RBI is buying this long-term bond in bulk, there is a huge demand for it.\n\nWhen the demand increases, the price will also increase.\n\nImagine that the price of the government bond increases to Rs.1200 in the secondary market for bonds. This means that\u00a0people are ready to sell the bond only at a higher price.\n\nNow, if a person is buying this bond, he will get only a 10% interest rate on the original price (Rs.1000) \u2013 which means only Rs.100 per year as interest. The new owner of the bond spent Rs 1200, but he will get an interest of Rs 100 and not Rs.120.\n\nWhat does this mean? The effective interest rate of the bond has decreased.\n\nInstead of the original 10% rate, the yield of the bond is now only 8.3%.\n\nRs.100 gain for a Rs.1200 investment is 8.3%. Even though the original interest rate is 10%, as the price of the bond increased the yield decreased.\n\nThis is one side of the story. The reverse happens when the Government sells short-term securities.\n\nThus by simultaneous buying and selling of government securities (Operation Twist), the RBI can bring down the long-term interest rates.\n\nBenefits of bringing down the long term interest rates\nThe public can borrow at a lower interest rate so that credit, consumption, and investment will go up.\nThe government can borrow at a lower interest rate to finance the fiscal deficit.\nWhy Operation Twist is necessary? Why Can\u2019t RBI directly reduce the interest rates?\n\nThe Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism is not fine-tuned in India.\n\nFor example, the RBI slashed key interest rate \u2014 the repo rate \u2014 by 1.35 per cent in 2019, but banks passed on only part of it.\n\nThe one-year median marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) has declined only 0.5 per cent.\n\nThus we can see that the conventional methods were not effective enough.\n\nAs interest rates remained high, most of the businesses were not taking loans. The credit growth was extremely sluggish.\n\nAs the Indian GDP growth rate fell below 5 per cent, to revive the economy (by attracting investment), reduction in the effective interest rate was necessary. This necessitated RBI to adopt the unconventional monetary policy of \u2018Operation Twist\u2019.\n\n7 Key Points to Understand about Operation Twist\nOperation Twist is a monetary policy of the Reserve Bank of India.\nThis is an unconventional monetary policy of the RBI.\nOperation Twist is part of the Open Market Operation (OMO) of RBI.\nUnder Operation Twist, RBI does the simultaneous buying and selling of government securities.\nRBI buys long-term government securities while RBI sells short-term government securities.\nThe purpose of Operation Twist is to reduce the interest rate of long-term government bonds.\nAs the rate of interest gets reduced, both the public and the government can borrow at a cheaper rate. This is supposed to revive the economy.\nWhich topic do you want ClearIAS to prepare the next concept explainers?\n\nHope you liked the video and notes.

[ie. Taxation needs the approval of Parliament.]\nArticle 266: provides that \u2018no expenditure can be incurred except with the authorisation of the Legislature\u2019 [ie. Expenditure needs the approval of Parliament.]\nArticle 112: President shall, in respect of every financial year, cause to be laid before Parliament, Annual Financial Statement.\nFRBM Act\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act was passed by the Indian Parliament in 2003 for better budget management.\n\nThe FRBM act also provided for certain documents to be tabled in the Parliament of India, along with Budget, annually with regards to the country\u2019s fiscal policy.\n\nBudget Documents\n\nDo you know that the Annual Financial Statement is only one of the several budget documents presented by the Finance Minister?\n\nThe Budget documents presented to Parliament comprise, besides the Finance Minister\u2019s Budget Speech, the following:\n\nAnnual Financial Statement (AFS) \u2013 Article 112\nDemands for Grants (DG) \u2013 Article 113\nAppropriation Bill \u2013 Artice 114(3)\nFinance Bill \u2013 Article 110 (a)\nMemorandum Explaining the Provisions in the Finance Bill.\nMacro-economic framework for the relevant financial year \u2013 FRBM Act\nFiscal Policy Strategy Statement for the financial year \u2013\u00a0FRBM Act\nMedium Term Fiscal Policy Statement \u2013\u00a0FRBM Act\nMedium Term Expenditure Framework Statement \u2013\u00a0FRBM Act\nExpenditure Budget Volume-1\nExpenditure Budget Volume-2\nReceipts Budget\nBudget at a glance\nHighlights of Budget\nStatus of Implementation of Announcements made in Finance Minister\u2019s Budget Speech of the previous\u00a0financial year.\n\nThere are also other related documents like\u00a0Detailed Demands for Grants,\u00a0Outcome Budget,\u00a0Annual Reports and\u00a0Economic Survey presented along with the budget documents in Parliament.\n\nPS: The documents shown at Serial 1, 2, 3 and 4 are mandated by Art. 112,113, 114(3) and 110(a) of the\u00a0Constitution of India respectively, while the documents at Serial 6,7, 8 and 9 are presented as per the provisions\u00a0of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003. Other documents are in the nature of explanatory\u00a0statements supporting the mandated documents with narrative or other content in a user-friendly format suited\u00a0for quick or contextual references. Hindi version of all these documents is also presented to Parliament.\n\nGovernment Budgeting: Railway Budget Presentation\n\nDo figures related to Railways find mention in Annual Financial Statement or are they part of only Railway budget?\n\nUntil 2016 (for 92 years), the budget of the Indian Railways was presented separately to Parliament and dealt with separately. Even then the receipts and expenditure of the Railways formed part of the Consolidated Fund of India and the figures relating to them are included in the \u2018Annual Financial Statement\u2019.\n\nThe last Railway Budget was presented on 25 February 2016 by Mr. Suresh Prabhu.\n\nSince 2017, Railway Budget is merged with the Union Budget.\n\nGovernment Budgeting: Union Budget Presentation\n\nIn India, the Budget is presented to Parliament on such date as is fixed by the President.\n\nBetween 1999 to 2016, the General Budget was presented at 11 A.M. on the last working day of February.\n\nHowever, since 2017, the Indian Budget is presented on 1 February. As a convention, Economic Survey is also tabled in the Parliament \u2013 one day prior to budget submission, ie on January 31.\n\nNote: In an election year, Budget may be presented twice \u2014 first to secure Vote on Account for a few months and later in full.\n\nVote on Account\n\nThe discussion on the Budget begins a few days after its presentation.\n\nIf the Parliament is not able to vote the entire budget before the commencement of the new financial year (ie. within 1 month or so), the necessity to keep enough finance at the disposal of Government in order to allow it to run the administration of the country remains. A special provision is, therefore, made for \u201cVote on Account\u201d by which Government obtains the Vote of Parliament for a sum sufficient to incur expenditure on various items for a part of the year.\n\nNormally, the Vote on Account is taken for two months only. But during the election year or when it is anticipated that the main Demands and Appropriation Bill will take a longer time than two months, the Vote on Account may be for a period exceeding two months.\n\nSo what exactly is Vote on Account?\n\nVote on Account is a special provision by which the Government obtains the\u00a0Vote of Parliament\u00a0for a sum sufficient to incur expenditure on various items for a part of the year, usually two months.\n\nVote on Account was widely used along with every budget before 2016 when the date of the budget presentation was the last day of February. Now vote on account is used only in special years like the election years (used along with interim budget).\n\nVote on Account deals only with the expenditure part. But the interim budget, as well as full budget, has both receipt and expenditure side.\n\nSo presentation and passing of vote on account is the first stage in the budget passing process. Vote on Account is necessary for the working of the government until the period the full budget is passed.\n\nBudget Speech\n\nThe Budget Speech of the Finance Minister is usually in two parts. Part A deals with the general economic survey of the country while Part B relates to taxation proposals.\n\nHe makes a speech introducing the Budget and it is only in the concluding part of his speech that the proposals for fresh taxation or for variations in the existing taxes are disclosed by him.\n\nThe \u2018Annual Financial Statement\u2019 is laid on the Table of Rajya Sabha at the conclusion of the speech of the Finance Minister in Lok Sabha.\n\nLatest Budget\n\nYou can read the highlights of Budget 2020-2021 here.\n\nLatest Economic Survey\n\nYou can read the highlights of the Economic Survey 2019-2020 here.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the government budget plays a critical role in the economy of any country. It serves as a blueprint for the allocation of resources and guides the government\u2019s spending decisions. A well-designed budget can have a positive impact on economic growth, employment, and social welfare.\n\nRead: Interim Budget 2024",

Generally, one Demand for Grant is presented in respect of each Ministry or Department. However, more than one Demand may be presented for a Ministry or Department depending on the nature of expenditure.\nRegarding Union Territories without Legislature, a separate Demand is presented for each of the Union Territories.\n\nEach Demand first gives the totals of \u2018voted\u2019 and \u2018charged\u2019 expenditure as also the \u2018revenue\u2019 and \u2018capital\u2019 expenditure included in the Demand separately, and also the total of the amount of expenditure for which the Demand is presented.\n\nThis is followed\u00a0by the estimates of expenditure under different major heads of account. The breakup of the expenditure\u00a0under each major head between \u2018Plan\u2019 and \u2018Non-Plan\u2019 is also given.\nThe amounts of recoveries taken in the reduction of expenditure in the accounts are also shown.

This document also exhibits a broad break-up of expenditure \u2013 Plan and Non-Plan, allocation of Plan outlays by sectors as well as by Ministries/Departments, and details of resources transferred by the Central Government to State and Union Territory Governments.\nThis document also shows the revenue deficit, the gross primary deficit, and the gross fiscal deficit of the Central Government. The excess of the Government\u2019s revenue expenditure over revenue receipts constitutes a revenue deficit for the Government.\nThe difference between the total expenditure of the Government by way of revenue, capital, and loans net of repayments on the one hand and revenue receipts of the Government and capital receipts which are not like borrowing but which finally accrue to the Government on the other, constitutes gross fiscal deficit.\nGross primary deficit is measured by gross fiscal deficit reduced by gross interest payments. In the Budget documents \u2018gross fiscal deficit\u2019 and \u2018gross primary deficit\u2019 have been referred to in abbreviated form \u2018fiscal deficit\u2019 and \u2018primary deficit\u2019, respectively.\nThis document also shows the liabilities of the Government on account of securities (bonds) issued instead of oil and fertilizer subsidies.\nHighlights of Budget\nThis document explains the key features of the Budget, inter alia, indicating the prominent achievements in various sectors of the economy. It also explains, in brief, the budget proposals for the allocation of funds to be made in important areas.\nThe summary of tax proposals is also reflected in the document.\n\nAlso read: Capital Market Overview\n\nOther Budget Documents Along with Budget Statements\n\nThis includes detailed demand for grants, outcome budget, annual reports, and economic survey.\n\nDetailed Demands for Grants\nThe Detailed Demands for Grants are laid on the table of the Lok Sabha sometime after the presentation of the Budget, but before the discussion on Demands for Grants commences.\nDetailed Demands for Grants further elaborate on the provisions included in the Demands for Grants as also actual expenditure during the previous year.\nA breakup of the estimates relating to each program/organization, wherever the amount involved is not less than 10 lakhs, is given under several object heads which indicate the categories and nature of expenditure incurred on that program, like salaries, wages, travel expenses, machinery and equipment, grants-in-aid, etc.\nAt the end of these Detailed Demands are shown the details of recoveries taken in reduction of expenditure in the accounts.\nOutcome Budget\nWith effect from Financial Year 2007-08, the Performance Budget and the Outcome Budget hitherto presented to Parliament separately by Ministries/Departments, are merged and presented as a single document titled \u201cOutcome Budget\u201d by each Ministry/Department in respect of all Demands/Appropriations controlled by them, except those exempted from this requirement.\nOutcome Budget broadly indicates the physical dimensions of the financial budget of a Ministry/Department, indicating actual physical performance in the preceding year, performance in the first nine months (up to December) of the current year and the targeted performance during the ensuing year.\nAnnual Reports\nA descriptive account of the activities of each Ministry/Department during the year is given in the document Annual Report which is brought out separately by each Ministry/Department and circulated to Members of Parliament at the time of discussion on the Demands for Grants.\nEconomic Survey\nThe Economic Survey brings out the economic trends in the country which facilitates a better appreciation\u00a0of the mobilisation of resources and their allocation in the Budget.\nThe Survey analyses the trends in agricultural and industrial production, infrastructure, employment, money supply, prices, imports, exports, foreign exchange reserves, and other relevant economic factors which have a bearing on the Budget and is presented to the Parliament ahead of the Budget for the ensuing year.\nConclusion\n\nThe Budget of the Central Government is not merely a statement of receipts and expenditures. Since Independence, with the launching of the Five Year Plans, it has also become a significant statement of government policy.\n\nThe Budget reflects and shapes, and is, in turn, shaped by the country\u2019s economy. For a better\u00a0appreciation of the impact of government receipts and expenditure on the other sectors of the economy, it is\u00a0necessary to group them in terms of economic magnitudes, for example, how much is set aside for capital\u00a0formation, how much is spent directly by the Government and how much is transferred by Government to\u00a0other sectors of the economy by way of grants, loans, etc.\n\nThis analysis is contained in the Economic and\u00a0Functional Classification of the Central Government Budget which is brought out by the Ministry of Finance separately.",

    "[CONTENT] #462": "The FRBM Act was passed by the Parliament of India in 2003 to reduce Fiscal Deficit.\n\nEvery time when the Union Budget of India is presented, the term FRBM is seen in the news. You may see headlines like \u2018FRBM targets are missed\u2019 or \u2018FRBM targets are met\u2019. What exactly is FRBM? What is the significance of FRBM with respect to Indian economy?\n\nThe FRBM Act is a law enacted by the Government of India in 2003 to ensure fiscal discipline \u2013 by setting targets including reduction of fiscal deficits and elimination of revenue deficit.\n\nIt is considered as one of the major legal steps taken in the direction of fiscal consolidation in India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the full form of FRBM?\nWhy was the FRBM Act enacted?\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003\nWhat is the FRBM Act all about?\nObjectives of the FRBM Act\nProvisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act\nInitial FRBM Targets (to be met by 2008-09)\nDid the government meet the FRBM targets by March 2009?\nAmendments in the FRBM Act\nFRBM Targets after Amendment to FRBM Act in 2012 (to be achieved by 2015)\nFRBM Targets after Amendment to FRBM Act in 2015 (to be achieved by 2018)\nFRBM Review Committee headed by NK Singh: Recommendations\nLatest FRBM Targets\nEscape Clause in the FRBM Act\nWhat is the current status of Fiscal Deficit and Revenue Deficit?\nWhat if there is no Fiscal Discipline?\nConclusion\nWhat is the full form of FRBM?\n\nThe full form of FRBM is\u00a0Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management.\n\nWhy was the FRBM Act enacted?\n\nIn India, the borrowing levels were very high in the 1990s and 2000s. Indian Economy was weak as it had high Fiscal Deficit, high Revenue Deficit, and high Debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\nBy 2003, the continuous government borrowing and the resultant debt had severely impacted the health of the Indian economy. Much of the borrowing was utilized for interest payments of previous borrowings, but not for productive-purposes. This resulted in interest payments becoming the largest expenditure item of the government.\n\nMany economists then warned the government that this condition is not sustainable. They advised legal steps to prevent India to fall into a debt-trap.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nParliamentarians of India too felt that there should be control on the government of India not to resort to a high level of borrowing to fund its expenditure. Hence in 2000, they introduced a bill to bring responsibility and discipline in matters of expenditure and debt. This bill was passed by the Indian Parliament in 2003 and came to be known as the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.\u00a0\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill (FRBM Bill) was introduced in India by the then Finance Minister of India, Mr.Yashwant Sinha in December 2000. The provisions provided in the initial versions of the bill were too drastic. After much discussions, a watered-down version of the bill was passed in 2003 to become the FRBM Act. The FRBM Rules came into force from July 5, 2004.\n\nWhat is the FRBM Act all about?\n\nFRBM Act is all about maintaining a balance between Government revenue and government expenditure.\n\nThe intention of the\u00a0Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act was\u00a0to bring \u2013\n\nfiscal discipline.\nefficient management of expenditure, revenue and debt.\nmacroeconomic stability.\nbetter coordination between fiscal and monetary policy.\ntransparency in the fiscal operation of the Government.\nachieving a balanced budget.\nObjectives of the FRBM Act\n\nThe main objectives of the act were:\n\nto introduce transparent fiscal management systems in the country.\nto introduce a more equitable and manageable distribution of the country\u2019s debts over the years.\nto aim for fiscal stability for India in the long run\n\nAdditionally, the act was expected to give the necessary flexibility to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for managing inflation in India.\n\nProvisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act\n\nThe FRBM rules mandate four fiscal indicators to be projected in the medium-term fiscal policy statement. These are:\n\nrevenue deficit as a percentage of GDP\nfiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP.\ntax revenue as a percentage of GDP.\ntotal outstanding liabilities as a percentage of GDP.\n\nThe FRBM Act set targets for fiscal deficit and revenue deficit.\n\nThe FRBM act also provided for certain documents to be tabled in the Parliament of India, along with Budget, annually with regards to the country\u2019s fiscal policy. This included the Medium-term Fiscal Policy Statement, Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement, Macro-economic Framework Statement, and Medium-term Expenditure Framework Statement. For details check the details of the budget documents.\n\nInitial FRBM Targets (to be met by 2008-09)\nRevenue Deficit Target \u2013 revenue deficit should be completely eliminated by March 31, 2009. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.5% of GDP.\nFiscal Deficit Target \u2013 fiscal deficit should be reduced to 3% of GDP by March 31, 2009. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.3% of GDP.\nContingent Liabilities \u2013 The Central Government shall not give incremental guarantees aggregating an amount exceeding 0.5 per cent of GDP in any financial year beginning 2004-05.\nAdditional Liabilities \u2013\u00a0 Additional liabilities (including external debt at current exchange rate) should be reduced to 9% of the GDP by 2004-05. The minimum annual reduction target in each subsequent year to be 1% of GDP.\nRBI purchase of government bonds \u2013 to cease from 1 April 2006. This indicates the government not to borrow directly from the RBI.\nDid the government meet the FRBM targets by March 2009?\n\nNo. Implementing the act, the government had managed to cut the fiscal deficit to 2.7% of GDP and revenue deficit to 1.1% of GDP in 2007\u201308. However, the targets were not met.\n\nThe global financial crisis (2007-08) led the government to infuse resources in the economy as the fiscal stimulus in 2008. Therefore, fiscal targets had to be postponed temporarily in view of the global crisis.\n\nAmendments in the FRBM Act\n\nIn 2012 and 2015, notable amendments were made, resulting in relaxation of target realisation year.\n\nA new concept called Effective Revenue Deficit (E.R.D) was also introduced.\n\nThe requirement of \u2018Medium Term Expenditure Framework Statement\u2019 was also added via amendment in FRBMA.\n\nFRBM Targets after Amendment to FRBM Act in 2012 (to be achieved by 2015)\nRevenue Deficit Target \u2013\u00a0revenue deficit should be completely eliminated by March 31, 2015. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.5% of GDP.\nFiscal Deficit Target \u2013 fiscal deficit should be reduced to 3% of GDP by March 31, 2015.\u00a0The minimum annual reduction target was 0.3% of GDP.\nFRBM Targets after Amendment to FRBM Act in 2015 (to be achieved by 2018)\nRevenue Deficit Target \u2013\u00a0revenue deficit should be completely eliminated by March 31, 2018. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.5% of GDP.\nFiscal Deficit Target \u2013 fiscal deficit should be reduced to 3% of GDP by March 31, 2018.\u00a0The minimum annual reduction target was 0.3% of GDP.\nFRBM Review Committee headed by NK Singh: Recommendations\n\nThe government believed the targets were too rigid.\n\nIn May 2016, the government set up a committee under NK Singh to review the FRBM Act. The committee recommended that the government should target a fiscal deficit of 3 per cent of the GDP in years up to March 31, 2020, cut it to 2.8 per cent in 2020-21 and to 2.5 per cent by 2023.\n\nThe Committee suggested using debt as the primary target for fiscal policy. This ratio was 70% in 2017.\n\nThese are the targets set by NK Singh:\n\nDebt to GDP ratio: The review committee advocated for a Debt to GDP ratio of 60% to be targeted with a 40% limit for the centre and 20% limit for the states.\nRevenue Deficit Target \u2013\u00a0revenue deficit should be reduced to 0.8% of GDP by March 31, 2023. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.5% of GDP.\nFiscal Deficit Target \u2013 fiscal deficit should be reduced to 2.5% of GDP by March 31, 2023.\u00a0The minimum annual reduction target was 0.3% of GDP.\nLatest FRBM Targets\n\nThe latest provisions of the FRBM act requires the government to limit the fiscal deficit to 3% of the GDP by March 31, 2021, and the debt of the central government to 40% of the GDP by 2024-25, among others.\n\nThe Act provides room for deviation from the annual fiscal deficit target under certain conditions.\n\nEscape Clause in the FRBM Act\n\nEscape clause refers to the situation under which the central government can flexibly follow fiscal deficit target during special circumstances. This terminology was innovated by the NK Singh Committee on FRBM.\n\nIn Budget 2017, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley deferred the fiscal deficit target of 3% of the GDP and chose a target of 3.2%, citing the NK Singh committee report.\n\nHowever, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) pulled up the government for deferring the targets which it said should have been done through amending the Act.\n\nIn 2018, the FRBM Act was further amended. Specific details were updated in sub-section (2) of Section 4. The clause allows the govt to relax the fiscal deficit target for up to 50 basis points or 0.5 per cent. Under FRBM, if the escape clause is triggered to allow for a breach of fiscal deficit target, the RBI is then allowed to participate directly in the primary auction of government bonds, thus formalising deficit financing.\n\nThe Escape Clauses can be invoked:\n\nby the Government after formal consultations and advice of the Fiscal Council.\nwith a clear commitment to return to the original fiscal target in the coming fiscal year.\n\nIn 2020, Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman used the escape clause provided under the FRBM Act to allow the relaxation of the target. Finance Minister revised the fiscal deficit for FY20 to 3.8 per cent and pegged the target for FY21 to 3.5 per cent.\n\nNote: The Act exempts the government from following the FRBM guidelines in case of war or calamity.\n\nWhat is the current status of Fiscal Deficit and Revenue Deficit?\n\nFiscal Deficit (FD)- The Fiscal deficit as per the Indian Budget 2020-21 was estimated 3.5 % of GDP.\nRevenue Deficit (RD)- The Revenue Deficit as per the Indian Budget 2020-21 was estimated 2.7 % of GDP.\nEffective Revenue Deficit (ERD)- The effective revenue deficit as per the Indian Budget 2020-21 was estimated 1.8 % of GDP.\nTax to GDP ratio: 10.8\nDebt to GDP ratio (Central Government): 50.1\nWhat if there is no Fiscal Discipline?\n\nIf there is no fiscal discipline, the government (executive) may spend as it wishes.\n\nA country is just like a house; if the expenditure is too much and if there is no revenue to balance the high expenditure, the country will eventually fall into a debt trap, which may finally result in its collapse.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe FRBM Act seeks to achieve long-term macroeconomic stability, while generating budget surpluses, prudential debt management, limiting borrowings to cut down deficits and debt, greater transparency, removal of fiscal impediments and providing a medium-term framework for budgetary implementation.\n\nAs seen in the above analysis, different governments have failed to achieve the FRBM targets set to be achieved in 2008 even by 2020.\n\nThough the Act aims to achieve deficit reductions prima facie, an important objective is to achieve inter-generational equity in fiscal management. This is because when there are high borrowings today, it should be repaid by the future generation. But the benefit from high expenditure and debt today goes to the present generation.\n\nAchieving FRBM targets thus ensures inter-generation equity by reducing the debt burden of the future generation.",

Legislature.\n\nIn the case of the Central government, the Legislature corresponds to the lower house of the Parliament ie. Loksabha.\n\nWhere is this rule (mandate) written? Answer: Constitution of India.\n\nArticle 266 of the Constitution of India mandates that Parliamentary approval is required to draw money from the Consolidated Fund of India. Besides, Article 114 (3) of the Constitution stipulates that no amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund without the enactment of a law (appropriation bill).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Parliamentary Approval takes its time!\n\nThe full budget is usually passed only after long discussions.\u00a0Even though the government (executive) seeks approval of expenditure for the next financial year (April 1 to March 31) in the current financial year itself, the approval from legislature takes its time.\n\nVery often, discussion and voting of demands for grants and passing of Appropriation Bill\u00a0go beyond the current financial year. This was precisely the case before 2016 when the budget was presented on the last working day of February, and it was difficult to get passed within the same financial year.\n\nBut the government needs money for its day to day functions\u2026\n\nSince Parliament is not able to vote the entire budget before the commencement of the new financial year, the necessity to keep enough finance at the disposal of Government.\n\nA special provision is, therefore, made for \u201cVote on Account\u201d by which Government obtains the Vote of Parliament for a sum sufficient to incur expenditure on various items for a part of the year.\n\nVote on Account\n\nVote on Account\u00a0is a\u00a0grant in advance to enable the government to carry on until the voting of demands for grants and the passing of the Appropriation Bill and Finance Bill.\n\n\nThis enables the government to fund its expenses for a short period of time or until a full-budget is passed.\u00a0As a convention, a vote-on-account is treated as a formal matter and passed by Lok Sabha without discussion.\n\nVote on Account was frequently used until 2016 when the Budget was presented on the last working day of February. However, since 2017, the budget presentation date was advanced to February 1. This helped the executive to use almost 2 months time to get the full-budget passed in the same financial year. So, since 2017, Vote on Account is not usually used as part of the government budgeting process, unless in special cases like an election year.\n\nNormally, the Vote on Account is taken for two months only.\u00a0The\u00a0sum of the grant would be equivalent to one-sixth of the estimated expenditure for the entire year under various demands for grants.\n\nCan Vote on Account be granted for more than 2 months?\n\nYes.\u00a0During election year or when it is anticipated that the main Demands and Appropriation Bill will take longer time than two months, the Vote on Account may be granted for a period exceeding two months.\n\nFor example, in 2019, Vote on Account is taken for 4 months.\n\nDifference between Full Budget and\u00a0Vote on Account\nFull Budget deals with both expenditure and revenue side but Vote-on-account deals only with the expenditure side of the government\u2019s budget.\nThe vote-on-account is normally valid for two months\u00a0but a full budget is valid for 12 months (a financial year).\nAs a convention, a vote-on-account is treated as a formal matter and passed by Lok Sabha without discussion. But passing for budget happens only after discussions and voting on demand for grants.\nA vote-on-account cannot alter direct taxes since they need to be passed through a finance bill. Under the regular Budget, fresh taxes may be imposed and old ones may go.\nAs a convention, a vote-on-account is treated as a formal matter and passed by the Lok Sabha without discussion. But the full budget is passed only after discussions and voting on demand for grants.\nWhat is an interim budget then?\n\nAn interim budget in all practical sense is a full budget but made by the government during the last year of its term \u2013 ie. just before the election.\u00a0An interim Budget is a complete set of accounts, including both expenditure and receipts. But it may not contain big policy proposals.\n\nIs it mandatory for the government to present vote on account instead of a full budget in an election year?\n\nIt is not mandatory for the government to present a vote on account in an election year.\n\nThough the convention is to present an interim budget and get the fund required for spending via the vote on account route, the government (if it wishes so) can even go for a Full Budget and get the appropriation bills passed to get the finances.\n\nHowever, during an election year,\u00a0the ruling government generally opts for a vote-on-account or interim budget instead of a full budget. While technically, it is not mandatory for the government to present a vote-on-account, but it would be inappropriate to impose policies that may or may not be acceptable to the incoming government taking over in the same year.\n\nRead: Interim Budget 2024",

    "[CONTENT] #471": "What is tax expenditure? What is its importance in the Indian economy? Read further to know more.\n\nTax Expenditure corresponds to relaxations given when tax burden becomes difficult for the sustainability of a particular sector. Tax exemptions or incentives are given in the form of lower rates of tax relative to normal rates.\n\nTax expenditures are revenue losses attributable to tax provisions that often result from the use of the tax system to promote social goals without incurring direct expenditures.\n\nNormally these exemptions are generated for particular purposes as tax incentives. [Why we are talking about this now : Because,\u00a0UPSC asked a question in 2013 Mains as follows: \u201cWhat is the meaning of the term tax-expenditure? Taking housing sector as an example, discuss how it influences budgetary policies of the government.\u201d\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTax Expenditure and its importance in Indian Economy\nWhy Tax Exemptions given are called Tax Expenditure?\nTax Expenditure and Budgetary Policies in Housing Sector\nTax Expenditure Budget\nVolume of Tax Expenditure and Subsidies\nReference links for Tax Expenditure:\nTax Expenditure and its importance in Indian Economy\n\nThe term \u2018tax expenditure\u2019 is associated with budget. Though many are familiar with the concept of subsidies and its impact on Indian Economy, it seems not every one know the details of tax-expenditure. Tax-expenditure more or less has the same impact as subsidies as a necessary evil.\n\nTax expenditures can take many forms. Some result from tax provisions that reduce the present value of taxable income through deferral allowances, or special exclusions, exemptions, or deductions from gross income. Others affect a household\u2019s after-tax income more directly through tax credits or preferential rates for specific activities.\n\nWhy Tax Exemptions given are called Tax Expenditure?\n\nIf government didn\u2019t give any tax exemptions, this deducted amount would have belonged to government itself. Though Tax Expenditure are not direct spending by government, the concept of tax expenditure is that, government is giving back money to achieve certain social goals, like strengthening housing sector or industrial sector. But in actual sense, Government is not collecting money to be re-distributed later, but gives away tax exemptions.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTax Expenditure and Budgetary Policies in Housing Sector\n\n\u00a0\n\nExemptions allowed for deduction of HRA (Income tax) and various other income tax deductions and exemptions (Eg: Medical Premium).\nExemptions allowed for interest payment and principal repayment for housing loans.\nTax Expenditure in Union Budget 2013 :\u00a0First home loan from a bank or housing finance corporation upto Rs. 25 lakh entitled to additional deduction of interest upto Rs. 1 lakh.\nNB: It should be noted that due to various policies of government, the number of persons who own houses have increased. More over, the people can afford to spend on infrastructure as they don\u2019t have to give taxes.\nTax Expenditure Budget\n\nThe tax expenditure budget comprises the estimated revenue losses attributable to various exclusions, exemptions, deductions, nonrefundable credits, deferrals, and preferential rates in the tax code. These provisions reduce the income tax liabilities of individuals or businesses that undertake certain types of activities.\n\nVolume of Tax Expenditure and Subsidies\n\nSo we hope now it is clear that tax-expenditure corresponds to the revenue a government foregoes through the provisions of tax laws that allow deductions, exclusions, or exemptions from the taxpayers\u2019 taxable expenditure.\n\nThe revenue foregone from corporate and personal income taxes, estate, and customs duties amounts to near 6.5 per cent of GDP. As a share of revenue realised, the foregone revenue accounts to near 80%. As is it is clear, this is by now means a meager amount.\n\nYou might have heard opposition parties shouting about crony capitalism and excess favors done to corporates. Yes, you can connect tax expenditure right here. And that may be one of the reasons why UPSC asked this question. But UPSC was concerned only about Housing sector; so the answer should also be written from that perspective, highlighting the positives and negatives.\n\nReference links for Tax Expenditure:\ntaxpolicycenter.org.",

Fiscal deficit in layman\u2019s terms corresponds to the borrowings and liabilities of the government. As per the technical definition,\n\nFiscal Deficit = Budgetary Deficit + Borrowings and Other Liabilities of the government.\n\nNote: Deficit differs from debt, which is an accumulation of yearly deficits.\u00a0The elements of the fiscal deficit are\u00a0revenue deficit and\u00a0capital expenditure.\nNote: Revenue deficit is the difference between the government\u2019s revenue\u00a0expenditure and total revenue receipts.\n\nAlso read: Indian Budget and Fiscal Deficit.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYes, there is gap between income and expenditure \u2013 But how to fill the gap?\n\nThe fiscal deficit can be financed by borrowing from the Reserve Bank of India (which is also called deficit financing or money creation) and market borrowing (from the money market, that is mainly from banks).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBut uncontrolled borrowing is not good for the economy, as a greater portion of the governments revenue will in future be used to pay back the interest of loans and the money available for social sector initiatives will reduce. Besides the fiscal deficits accumulate over years resulting in a big debts and debt traps.\n\nWhile steps taken by the government to bring the 2012/13 fiscal deficit within a targeted 5.3 percent of GDP have reduced near term risks, cuts in politically sensitive subsidies were needed for sustainable fiscal consolidation. RBI expects government to control its unproductive expenditure to bridge the gap.\n\nWhat is Current Account Deficit (CAD)?\n\nCurrent Account is the sum of the balance of trade (exports minus imports of goods and services), net factor income (such as interest and dividends) and net transfer payments (such as foreign aid).\n\nCurrent Account= Trade balance+Net factor income+Net transfer payments\n\nAlso read about, balance of payments\n\nHow should the gap in dollar supply be filled?\n\nThe right way to fill the gap is by increasing the exports and decreasing the imports, which is a step easier said than done. At present India is depending more on FIIs to fill the gap, but since these investments are volatile and risky, this is not healthy. We need urgent steps to boost FDI and exports.\n\nThe current account deficit (CAD) touched a record of more than 5% of GDP in 2014.\u00a0But in came down later, thanks to the measures taken by RBI and fall in global oil prices.\n\nTwin Deficit Problem\n\nCurrent Account Deficit and Fiscal Deficit, both of which occur when a country\u2019s spending exceeds its income, are referred to as twin deficit problem\u00a0because they frequently reinforce one another. For example, a high fiscal deficit causes a higher current account deficit, and vice versa.\n\nImpact of twin deficit problem\n\nThe twin deficit issue, particularly the expanding current account deficit, could amplify the impact of more expensive imports and devalue the rupee, further escalating external imbalances.",

Up to\u00a01964, it was presented along with the Union Budget. From 1964 0nwards, it has been delinked from the Budget.\n\nWho prepares the Economic Survey?\n\nThe Economic Survey was prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Finance Ministry under the overall guidance of the Cheif Economic Adviser. After receiving inputs from the senior officers in the Ministry of Finance, the final version of the Economic Survey is scrutinized by the Finance Secretary and finally approved by the Union Finance Minister.\n\nWhen is Economic Survey presented?\n\nIt is presented every year in the Parliment during the Budget Session.

States argue that including them would hamper their revenue and they would suffer a huge resource. However, some experts say that the real reason is the nexus of politicians with some business class and high-profile lobbying. Further, the Finance minister of India has said in the parliament that the consensus to include alcohol and tobacco under the GST regime is possible in foreseeable future.\nDecision criteria for the tax bracket: There are apprehensions that how to decide about the items and the criteria that which item will fall into which tax bracket. It may lead to lobbying. To this, the Finance minister has said that the decision will be taken by the GST Council only after due diligence and most probably by consensus.\nMultiple tax rates and brackets: The philosophical idea that GST means \u201cOne Nation one Tax\u201d is currently diluted due to multiple tax rates and brackets. To this, the Finance minister has said that since the target consumer of goods and services have different capabilities and therefore there must be a system similar to the democratic lines where higher value consumer pays more taxes.\nPower to impose tax taken away by Central Government from the Parliament: The Central GST Bill, 2017 allows the central government to notify CGST rates, subject to a cap. This implies that the government may change rates subject to a cap of 20%, without requiring the approval of Parliament. Under the Constitution, the power to levy taxes is vested in Parliament and state legislatures. Though the proposal to set the rates through delegated legislation meets this requirement, the question is whether it is appropriate to do so without prior parliamentary scrutiny and approval.\nConfusion regarding the location of consumption: Under GST, both state and the Centre can tax the services based on their location of consumption. Now the confusion arises since the general rule to determine the location of the recipient is his location or address on record; there are specific rules for various services such as telecom, property, transportation, etc. This means that while a service may be consumed across multiple states, the tax revenue would be attributed to the state where the recipient is registered or his office is located.\u00a0 This could lead to higher taxes attributed to states that have more registered offices. For example, suppose a company is located in Bangalore and advertises its products in the Kolkata edition of a newspaper, which has its registered office in Delhi. In this case, one may argue that the service is being finally consumed in Kolkata. However, as the recipient of services is in Bangalore, the tax would accrue to Karnataka.\nAnti-Profiteering Clause: The government is planning to set up an authority to see if any reduction in tax rates after GST is passed on to the consumer by companies or not. The industry and businesses are not taking this idea kindly and they see it as a backdoor entry of inspector raj. Experts say that prices should be market determined and no government authority has the business of deciding prices for goods and services.\nConfusion regarding the control over taxation: To avoid dual control, the GST council has reached a compromised formula. 90 percent of tax assesses with an annual turnover of Rs 1.5 crore or less, will be assessed by states and the rest by the Centre. For those with a turnover of over Rs 1.5 crore, the states and the Centre will share it equally.\u00a0However, this \u2018solution\u2019 has its own set of issues. For example, if an entity with a turnover of less than Rs 1.5 crore in one year, posts a turnover of Rs 1.5 crore in the following financial year, who would be the new authority to take over the assessment? And, how will the existing investigations, if any, against the entity be addressed, and by whom? \u201cThere are a lot of procedural issues, and if these issues are not addressed properly, they would lead to litigations.\nThe issue of casual taxable person: If a person registered in one state moves to another state for a short period for some business transaction \u2013\u00a0say to participate in a fair or exhibition, then that person would have to get himself registered in that state for that period.\n\u00a0What is GSTN?\nGSTN is registered as a not-for-profit company under the Companies Act.\nIt has been formed to set up and operate the information technology backbone of the GST.\nWhile the Central (24.5%) and the state (24.5%) governments hold a combined stake of 49%, the remaining 51% stake is divided among five financial institutions\u2014LIC Housing Finance with 11% stake and ICICI Bank, HDFC, HDFC Bank and NSE Strategic Investment Corporation Ltd with 10% stake each.\nGSTN had awarded Infosys Ltd the contract to develop the hardware and software for GST.\nThe idea behind GSTN was to set up an entity that is equidistant from both the Central government and the state governments, as it will advise both the Centre and the states on the information technology network\nControversy around GSTN\n\nIt is argued by some as a private company and therefore not under government control. It may lead to a breach of tax data into private hands and manipulation of the same for the advantage of some corporates.\n\nTo this allegation, the Finance minister replied in the parliament that this arrangement was decided by the empowered committee of the previous government and the present government has endorsed it by considering the fact that private professionals are required for a such a high-octane system. Further, he said that if in future there seems to be any problem with the current structure then it can be changed through the GST Council debate and discussion.\n\nFurther, the GSTN website clarifies that the strategic control over GSTN is with the government given the sensitivity of the role of GSTN and the information that would be available to it. The strategic control of the government over GSTN is ensured through measures such as the composition of the board, mechanism of special resolution and shareholders agreement, induction of government officers on deputation and agreements between GSTN and governments.\n\nAlso Read: Types of Taxes in India\n\nArticle by: Nishant\u00a0Raj.

In this article let us try to understand the concept of Universal Basic Income, why it is needed, what are the challenges in its implementation and other related issues.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Universal Basic Income (UBI)?\nWhy Universal Basic Income?\nHow does UBI work?\nWhat does UBI mean to the Government?\nWhat are the advantages of UBI?\nWhat are the main arguments against UBI?\nWhat are the challenges that may face in Implementation of UBI?\nWhat Economic Survey 2016-17 says about UBI?\nUBI and \u2018JAM Trinity\u2019\nThe main problems in \u2018JAM Trinity\u2019\nUBI in other parts of the world\nConclusion\nWhat is Universal Basic Income (UBI)?\n\nUniversal Basic Income is a periodic, unconditional cash transfer to every citizen in the country.\nHere, social or economic positions of the individual are not taken into consideration.\nThe concept of universal basic income has three main features. They are as following:\nUBI is universal in nature. It means UBI is not targeted.\nThe second feature of UBI is cash transfer instead of in-kind transfer.\nThe third feature is that UBI is unconditional. That means one need not prove his or her unemployment status or socio-economic identity to be eligible for UBI.\nWhy Universal Basic Income?\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nAs a form of social security UBI will help in reducing inequality and eliminating poverty. Thus it ensures security and dignity for all individuals.\nAs human labour is being substituted by technology, there will be reduced wage income and reduced purchasing power. UBI will compensate for reduced purchasing power.\nHow does UBI work?\nUnder UBI, only those with zero income will receive the full benefits in net terms.\nFor those, who earn additional income over the basic income, the net benefits will taper off through taxation.\nSo even though the basic income is universal, only the poor will receive the full benefits.\nWhat does UBI mean to the Government?\nThere would be drastic changes in the way government spends its revenue generated from taxation and other sources.\nCurrently, the Government spends its revenue on various services as well as on subsidies.\nUBI would mean that government may move away from service delivery and empower its citizens to access services through cash transfer.\nWhat are the advantages of UBI?\n\nFirst, UBI would give individuals freedom to spend the money in a way they choose. In other words, UBI strengthens economic liberty at an individual level. This would help them to choose the kind of work they want to do, rather than forcing them to do unproductive work to meet their daily requirements.\nUniversal Basic Income would be a sort of an insurance against unemployment and hence helps in reducing poverty.\nUBI will result in equitable distribution of wealth. As explained above, only poor will receive the full net benefits.\nIncreased income will increase the bargaining power of individuals, as they will no longer be forced to accept any working conditions.\nUBI is easy to implement. Because of its universal character, there is no need to identify the beneficiaries. Thus it excludes errors in identifying the intended beneficiaries \u2013 which is a common problem in targeted welfare schemes.\nAs every individual receive basic income, it promotes efficiency by reducing wastages in government transfers. This would also help in reducing corruption.\nConsiderable gains could be achieved in terms of bureaucratic costs and time by replacing many of the social sector schemes with UBI.\nAs economic survey points out, transferring basic income directly into bank accounts will increase the demand for financial services. This would help banks to invest in the expansion of their service network, which is very important for financial inclusion.\nUnder some circumstances, UBI could promote greater productivity. For example, agriculture labourers who own small patch of land and earlier used to work in others\u2019 farm for low wages, can now undertake farming on their own land. In long term, this will reduce the percentage of unused land and helps in increasing agriculture productivity.\nWhat are the main arguments against UBI?\nA guaranteed minimum income might make people lazy and it breeds dependency. They may opt out of labour market.\nThere is no guarantee that the additional income will be spent on education, health etc. there are chances that the money will be spent on \u2018temptation goods\u2019 such as alcohol, tobacco, drugs etc.\nGiven the large population size, the fiscal burden on government would be high. Also, as Economic Survey 2016-17 noted, once implemented, it may become difficult for the government to wind up a UBI in the case of failure.\nIf the UBI is funded by higher taxes, especially by the indirect taxes, it will result in inflation. This, in turn, will reduce the purchasing power of the people and lowers the value of the amount transferred.\nA \u2018guaranteed minimum income\u2019 might reduce the availability of workers in some sectors which are necessary but unattractive and raise the wages of such works. For example, the wages of agriculture labour might increase due to non-availability of workers willing to work in others\u2019 farm.\nWhat are the challenges that may face in Implementation of UBI?\nAccording to World Bank, in India, there are only 20 ATMs for every one lakh adult population. Nearly one-third of the Indian adults remain unbanked. With such a state of financial service infrastructure and financial inclusion, it would be difficult for the people to access their benefits.\nFinancing the \u2018guaranteed minimum income\u2019 would be another challenge. There are chances that UBI would become an add-on to existing subsidies rather than replace them.\nWhat Economic Survey 2016-17 says about UBI?\n\nThe Economic survey 2016-17 assumes that in practice any program cannot strive for strict universality. So survey proposes some alternatives.\n\nFirst, survey targets bottom 75 percent of the population and this is termed as \u2018quasi-universality\u2019\u2019. The cost for this quasi-universality is estimated to be around 4.9 percent of GDP.\nSecond alternative targets women, who generally face worse prospects in employment opportunities, education, health or financial inclusion. A UBI for women can reduce the fiscal cost of providing a UBI to about half. Giving money to women also reduces the concerns of money being used on \u2018temptation goods\u2019.\nThird, to start with a UBI for certain vulnerable groups such as widows, pregnant mothers, the old and the infirm.\n\nBut, if any one of the above alternatives is adopted, it will also face the problem of \u2018exclusion error\u2019 in the identification of beneficiaries. Efficiency will be reduced. Corruption will creep in. \u00a0More importantly, UBI will not remain \u2018universal\u2019.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nUBI and \u2018JAM Trinity\u2019\n\nJAM is the short form of\u00a0Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile.\nCurrently, there are 26.5 crore Jan Dhan accounts across the country. This covers 21 percent of the population. Of these accounts, 57 percent are Aadhaar seeded.\nOver a billion Aadhaar cards have been distributed.\nWhen the trinity of Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile (popularly referred to as JAM) is fully adopted, a more efficient mode of delivery would be available.\nJAM system could be used to provide funds to each individual directly into his or her account.\nThe main problems in \u2018JAM Trinity\u2019\nAuthentication failures in Aadhaar are as high as 49 percent in Jharkhand. This will result in the exclusion of beneficiaries.\nA Large number of Jan Dhan accounts are not active. According to Financial Inclusion Insights (FII \u2013 2015), only 40 percent of the accounts are active.\nStill, nearly one-third of the Indian adults remained unbanked.\nThere are issues in mobile network connectivity, especially in rural India.\nUBI in other parts of the world\nFinland has started a pilot programme this year to understand the effects of a basic income. Finland government would pay \u20ac560 per month to two thousand unemployed individuals for next two years, and it would continue to provide the income even if individuals find employment during this period.\nSome regions in the Netherlands and Canada have also announced the pilot programme.\nBut, last year, Switzerland voted on UBI and rejected the proposal to transfer 2,500 Swiss francs per month to every adult citizen and long-term resident. The fiscal implication was the main reason for rejection of the proposal in Switzerland.\nConclusion\n\nDespite making remarkable progress in poverty reduction, nearly 22 percent of the population lives below poverty line (Tendulkar committee report, 2011-12). One of the major criticisms of poverty alleviation programmes is significant leakages. UBI is seen as a more efficient alternative.\n\nThough UBI has many advantages, there are many practical challenges too. A transparent and safe financial architecture that is accessible to all is important for the success of the UBI. In other words, the success of UBI depends on the success of efficient mode of delivery like JAM Trinity.\n\nAlso, a behavioral change on the part of account holders needed so that they use their accounts more often. Banks need to find it profitable to provide access to banking services.\n\nAs Economic Survey states, UBI is a powerful idea whose time even if not ripe for implementation is ripe for serious discussion.\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Divakar Shenoy H",

Economic\u00a0activities are broadly grouped into primary,\u00a0secondary, tertiary activities. Higher services under tertiary activities are again classified into quaternary and quinary activities.\n\nLet us first understand the differences between the different sectors of the economy, so that it will be easier for us to understand the factors responsible for the location of primary, secondary, and tertiary sector industries in various parts of the world (including India).\n\nPrimary activities\n\nPrimary activities are directly dependent on the environment as these refer to utilisation of earth\u2019s resources such as land, water, vegetation, building materials and minerals. It, thus includes hunting and gathering, pastoral activities, fishing, forestry, agriculture, and mining and quarrying.\n\nPeople engaged in primary activities are called red-collar\u00a0workers due to the outdoor nature of their work.\n\nAlso read: Inter-State Trade and Commerce\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSecondary\u00a0activities\n\nSecondary activities add value to natural\u00a0resources by transforming raw materials into\u00a0valuable products.\u00a0Secondary activities, therefore, are\u00a0concerned with manufacturing, processing and\u00a0construction (infrastructure) industries.\n\nPeople engaged in secondary activities are called blue-collar workers.\n\nAlso read: Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)\n\nTertiary\u00a0activities\n\nTertiary activities include both production and exchange. The production involves the \u2018provision\u2019 of services that are \u2018consumed. Exchange involves trade, transport and communication facilities that are used to overcome distance.\n\nTertiary jobs = White-collar jobs.\n\nQuaternary\u00a0activities\n\nQuaternary activities are specialized tertiary activities in the \u2018Knowledge Sector\u2019 which demands a separate classification. There has been a very high growth in demand for and consumption of information-based services from mutual fund managers to tax consultants, software developers and statisticians. Personnel working in office buildings, elementary schools and university classrooms, hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices, theatres, accounting and brokerage firms all belong to this category of services. Like some of the tertiary functions, quaternary activities can also be outsourced. They are not tied to resources, affected by the environment, or necessarily localised by market.\n\nQuinary\u00a0activities\n\nQuinary activities are services that focus on the creation, re-arrangement and interpretation of new and existing ideas; data interpretation and the use and evaluation of new technologies. Often referred to as \u2018gold collar\u2019 professions, they represent another subdivision of the tertiary sector representing special and highly paid skills of senior business executives, government officials, research scientists, financial and legal consultants, etc. Their importance in the structure of advanced economies far outweighs their numbers. The highest level of decision-makers or policymakers performs quinary activities.\n\nQuinary = Gold collar professions.",

These factors include physical, economic, social, and historical considerations.\n\nPrimary Sector Industries\nNatural Resources: Industries involved in extracting raw materials, such as agriculture, mining, and forestry, tend to be located near the sources of natural resources.\nFor example, agricultural activities are usually situated in regions with fertile soil and favorable climatic conditions.\nSecondary Sector Industries\nRaw Material Availability: Industries like manufacturing and construction rely on the proximity to raw materials. Regions with easy access to raw materials, such as iron ore for steel production, tend to attract these industries.\nTransportation: Proximity to transportation networks, including roads, railways, and ports, is crucial for the movement of raw materials and finished products. Industries often locate near transportation hubs to minimize costs.\nLabor Availability: Labor-intensive industries are often located where there is a skilled or low-cost labor force. Textile and garment industries, for instance, may be located in regions with a large workforce.\nEnergy Availability: Industries requiring a significant amount of energy, like heavy manufacturing, may be located near energy sources such as coal, hydroelectric power, or oil and gas.\nMarket Proximity: Industries that produce consumer goods may locate close to major markets to reduce transportation costs and reach consumers efficiently.\nGovernment Policies: Incentives and regulations set by governments can influence industry location. Tax breaks, subsidies, and other policies can attract industries to specific regions.\nTertiary Sector Industries\nMarket Demand: Service industries, such as retail, hospitality, and healthcare, are often located in areas with high population densities and strong consumer demand.\nAccess to Customers: Proximity to potential customers is important for many service industries. Businesses like banks and restaurants are often located in commercial and urban centers.\nTransportation and Accessibility: Service industries need good transportation links to serve customers effectively. Airports, highways, and public transportation play a role in location decisions.\nInfrastructure: The availability of modern infrastructure, including communication networks, is important for service industries that rely on information and technology.\nEconomic Base: Tertiary sector industries are often concentrated in urban areas with diverse economic activities and a larger consumer base.\n\nIndustrial locations are complex. These are influenced by the availability of many factors. Some of them are raw materials, land, water, labor, capital, power, transport, and market.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFor ease of convenience, we can classify the location factors into two: geographical factors and non-geographical factors.\n\nGeographical Factors\n\n\u00a0\n\nRaw material: Availability of natural resources that can be used as raw material.\nTechnology: To turn the resource into an asset with value.\nPower: To utilize the technology.\nLabor: Human resources in the area who can function as labor to run the processes.\nTransport: Road/rail connectivity.\nStorage and warehousing.\nMarketing feasibility.\nCharacteristics of land and soil.\nClimate.\nPrecipitation and water resources.\nVulnerability to natural resources.\n\nExplanation:\n\nRaw materials are one of the important factors in an industrial location. The mere location of industries itself may be determined by the availability or location of the raw materials.\nPower \u2013 conventional (coal, mineral oil, or hydroelectricity) or- conventional is a necessity for any industrial establishment.\nThe availability of labor or a skilled workforce is the success mantra for the growth of all industries.\nThe availability of easy transportation always influences the location of the industry. So the junction points of waterways, roadways, and railways become humming centers of industrial activity.\nThe finished goods should reach the market at the end of the process of manufacturing. Thus nearness to the market is an add-on quality in the process of selecting a location for industry.\nThe availability of water is another factor that influences the industrial location. Many industries are established near rivers, canals, and lakes, because of this reason. Iron and steel industries, textile industries, and chemical industries require large quantities of water, for their proper functioning.\nThe site that is selected for the establishment of an industry must be flat and well-served by adequate transport facilities.\nThe climate of the area selected for the industry is important, very harsh climates are not suitable for successful industrial growth.\nNon-geographical Factors\nCapital investment.\nAvailability of loans.\nInvestment climate.\nGovernment policies/regulations.\nInfluence of pressure groups.\n\nExplanation:\n\nCapital or huge investment is needed for the establishment of industries.\nGovernment policies are another factor that influences industrial location. The government sets certain restrictions in the allocation of land for industries to reduce regional disparities, control excessive pollution, and avoid the excessive clustering of industries in big cities.\nIndustrial inertia is the predisposition of industries or companies to avoid relocating facilities even in the face of changing economic circumstances that would otherwise induce them to leave. Often the costs associated with relocating fixed capital assets and labor far outweigh the costs of adapting to the changing conditions of an existing location.\nEfficient and enterprising organization and management are essential for running the modem industry successfully.\nThe location that has better banking facilities and Insurance are best suited for the establishment of industries.\n\nIt is rarely possible to find all these factors available in one place. Consequently, manufacturing activity tends to be located at the most appropriate place where all the factors of industrial location are either available or can be arranged at a lower cost.\n\nIn general, it should also be noted that both lower production cost and lower distribution cost are the two major factors when considering the location of an industry. Sometimes, the government provides incentives like subsidized power, lower transport costs, and other infrastructure so that industries may be located in backward areas.\n\nIndustrial System\n\nAn industrial system consists of inputs, processes, and outputs. The inputs are the raw materials, labor, and costs of land, transport, power, and other infrastructure.\n\nThe processes include a wide range of activities that convert the raw material into finished products. The outputs are the end product and the income earned from it. In the case of the textile industry, the inputs may be cotton, human labor, factory, and transport costs.\n\nThe processes include ginning, spinning, weaving, dyeing, and printing. The output is the shirt you wear.\n\nIndustrialization and Urbanization\n\nAfter an industrial activity starts, urbanization follows. Sometimes, industries are located in or near the cities. Thus, industrialization and urbanization go hand in hand. Cities provide markets and also provide services such as banking, insurance, transport, labor, consultants financial advice, etc. to the industry.\n\nAgglomeration Economies\n\nMany industries tend to come together to make use of the advantages offered by the urban centers known as agglomeration economies. Gradually, a large industrial agglomeration takes place.\n\nFactors Responsible for the Location of Primary Secondary and Tertiary Sector Industries in India\n\nIn the pre-independence period, most manufacturing units were located in places from the point of view of overseas trade such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, etc.\n\nConsequently, there emerged certain pockets of industrially developed urban centers surrounded by a huge agricultural rural hinterland.\n\nIndia\u2019s primary sector industries, like agriculture, are influenced by factors such as climate, soil fertility, and water availability.\nSecondary industries often located near raw material sources, such as steel plants near iron ore deposits.\nTertiary sector industries are often found in urban areas with a dense population and consumer demand, such as cities with IT hubs.\n\nA combination of factors unique to each sector and region shapes the location of industries around the world, contributing to regional economic development and specialization.\n\nRelated posts\nIndustrial Regions of India\nDistribution of Major Industries: Location Factors",

However, most of the recommendations in the reports of\u00a0National Commission on Farmers are not yet implemented.\n\nRecommendations of the National Commission on Farmers\nAsset reforms\n1. LAND REFORM:\n\nLand reforms are necessary to address the basic issue of access to land for both crops and livestock.\u00a0 Land holdings inequality is reflected in land ownership.\u00a0 In 1991-92, the share of the bottom half of the rural households in the total land ownership was only 3% and the top 10% was as high as 54%.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nReforms in tenancy laws, land leasing, distribution of ceiling surplus land and wasteland, providing adequate access to common property and wasteland resources, and the consolidation of holdings.\nPrevent diversion of prime agricultural land and forest to the corporate sector for non-agricultural purposes.\nWherever feasible, landless labour households should be provided with at least 1 acre per household, which will give them space for home gardens and animal rearing.\nEstablish a National Land Use Advisory Service, which would have the capacity to link land use decisions with ecological meteorological and marketing factors on a location and season-specific basis.\n2. WATER:\n\nWater is a public good and social resource and not private property. Priority should be given to evolving just and equitable mechanisms to give access to water and to include local people in the management of water resources. The following steps are needed for supply augmentation and demand management of water resource:\n\nRainwater harvesting and aquifer recharge should be mandatory and farmers must be provided with financial assistance to invest in the replenishment of their renewable resource. This is the imperative need for conservation farming.\nDemand management through improved irrigation practices, including sprinkler and drip irrigation, should receive priority attention.\nA water literacy movement should be launched and regulations should be developed for the sustainable use of groundwater.\nIn water-scarce areas, the land use system should place emphasis on the cultivation of high value \u2013 low water requiring crops, such as pulses and oilseeds.\nA Pani Panchayat in every village can help in getting the available water distributed on an equitable basis.\nWater Users\u2019 Associations may be encouraged to gain expertise in maximizing the benefits of the available water. The National Rainfed Area Authority could help in promoting scientific water harvesting, sustainable and equitable use and the introduction of efficient methods of water use.\nIn drought-prone areas, a Drought Code may be introduced which details the action needed to minimize the impact of an adverse monsoon and maximize the benefits of a good season. Similarly, in areas prone to heavy rainfall, a Flood Code may be introduced.\n3. LIVESTOCK:\n\nLivestock, including poultry, is the second major land-based livelihood, contributing 26% of the agricultural GDP in 2004-05. It is clear that livestock and livelihoods are very intimately related in our country and that crop-livestock integrated farming is the pathway to farmers\u2019 well-being.\n\nAn urgent need for establishing Livestock Feed and Fodder Corporations at the State Level for ensuring availability of quality fodder and feed.\nA National Livestock Development Council may be established to give integrated attention to all aspects of this important sector, such as breeding policy, feed and fodder, healthcare through Para-veterinary professionals, marketing, value addition, biomass utilization (skin, bones and blood) and efficient use of animal energy, for example, through improved bullock carts.\nPoultry rearing should be recognized as an agricultural activity and appropriate support should be provided to backyard poultry farmers to establish Small Holders\u2019 Poultry Estates.\n4. FISHERIES:\n\nBoth coastal and inland fisheries provide employment and livelihoods to millions of families. There is considerable scope for improving the income of fisher families on an environmentally sustainable basis by introducing Integrated Coastal Zone Management and scientific fish rearing, harvesting and processing.\n\n\u201cFish for All Training and Capacity Building Centres\u201d which can impart training to fisher families in all aspects of the capture/culture\u2013consumption chain.\nQuality literacy to safeguard the harvested fish from Salmonella and other infections capable of producing mycotoxins.\nInland aquaculture, including the culture of ornamental fish and air-breathing fish, for additional income by providing necessary space in ponds and reservoirs.\nArtificial coral reefs to compensate for the loss of natural coral reefs to revive the fish catch.\nThe coastal communities can also be enabled to raise bio-shields comprising mangroves, Casuarina, salicornia, atriplex and other halophytic plants, to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of coastal fisher and farm families in the event of cyclonic storms and seawater inundation, as for example like the one caused by the tsunami of December 26, 2004.\n5. BIORESOURCES:\n\nBioresources refer to the abundant wealth of flora and fauna including soil micro-flora and micro-fauna.\n\nPreserving traditional rights of access to biodiversity, which include access to non-timber forest products including medicinal plants, gums and resins, oil-yielding plants and beneficial micro-organisms.\nConserving, enhancing and improving crops and farm animals as well as fish stocks through breeding.\nGenetic engineers working in public good institutions should perform the role of pre-breeding, i.e., development of novel genetic combinations for important economic traits, such as resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. They should then work with farmers in participatory breeding programs so that genetic efficiency and genetic diversity can be integrated in an effective manner.\nGenome Clubs can be organized in rural schools and colleges for imparting an understanding of the importance of genetic resources conservation.\nA genetic and legal literacy movement must be launched in areas rich in agro-biodiversities such as the North East, Western and the Eastern Ghats and the Arid Zone.\nReforms in support services\n\n1. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:\nThe research strategy should be a pro-nature and pro-small farmer.\nA National Biotechnology Regulatory Authority should be set up for safe and responsible use of recombinant DNA technology, with farmers\u2019 representatives on it.\nIntellectual Property Rights (IPR) policies should make provision for compulsory licensing of rights in the cases of research products and processes of value to resource-poor farming families.\n2. AGRO- METROLOGY:\nThere should be a National Land Use Advisory Service that gives proactive advice to help farm families plan their sowing based on anticipated meteorological and marketing factor. An integrated internet-FM or HAM radio service would be very helpful to fishermen on the high seas.\n3. CREDIT AND INSURANCE:\nThere is a need for both credit and insurance literacy in villages. Gyan Chaupals can help in this task.\nExpand the outreach of the formal credit system to reach the really poor and needy.\nEstablish an Agriculture Risk Fund to provide relief to farmers in the aftermath of successive natural calamities.\nKisan Credit Cards should be issued to women speedily with joint pattas to house/agricultural land as collateral.\nDrought-prone areas should have a 4-5 year repayment cycle for crop loans, taking into account the management of risk.\nFarmers of the future\n\nThe following are some of the methods that small and marginal farmers could consider for gaining in efficiency and economy:\n\nCooperative Farming and Service Cooperatives: Cooperative farming will be ideal for small and marginal farmers since the cooperative can provide centralized services like tractors and other farm equipment as well as threshing and drying machines, to support small-scale decentralized production. This will bring down the cost of production and enhance the quality of products and thereby of income.\nGroup Farming by Self-help Groups: promote the SHGs at the production end of the farming enterprise by encouraging groups to lease farmland.\nSmall Holders\u2019 Estates: The formation of Small Holders\u2019 Estates, for example in cotton, horticulture, medicinal plants, poultry and aquaculture will help promote group cooperation among farmers living in a village or watershed or the command area of an irrigation project.\nContract Farming: Symbiotic contracts which confer benefits to both producers and purchasers, will be ideal for ensuring assured and remunerative marketing opportunities. A Code of Conduct for Contract Farming will have to be developed for major groups of farm commodities such as vegetables, fruits, flowers, medicinal plants, tuber crops, pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane, cereals and cotton.\nFarmers\u2019 Companies: Small farmers and SHGs should be associated with such companies as stakeholders and not just as shareholders.\nAttracting Youth\nYouth will be attracted to take to farming as a profession only if farming becomes economically rewarding and intellectually stimulating.\nEducated youth should be helped through a form of Venture Capital Fund, low-interest loans and allotment of wastelands for setting up agri-clinics and production-cum-processing centres to undertake outsourcing jobs both from within and outside the country, enabling India to emerge as a major agricultural outsourcing hub.\nPublic policies for sustainable livelihoods\n\nThe following policies recommended by the National Commission on Farmers will the ensure well-being and livelihood security of all included under the category of \u201cfarmers\u201d:\n\nA National Land Use Advisory Service should be immediately established and linked to State and Block Level Land Use Advisory Services on a hub and spokesmodel.\nThe scope of the MSP programme should be expanded to cover all crops of importance to food and income security for small farmers.\nA Market Price Stabilization Fund should be established jointly by Central and State Governments and financial institutions to protect farmers during periods of violent fluctuations in prices. This fund has been set up in 2014-15.\nAn Agriculture Risk Fund should be set up to insulate farmers from risks arising from recurrent droughts and other weather aberrations.\nA Food Guarantee Act should be formulated and enacted. Farmers, who are also the largest consumer group, will produce more if there are greater consumption and consequently greater demand for farm produce and products.\nFarm families should also be protected from becoming victims of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB). Anti-retroviral drugs should be made available in villages free of cost.\nThere is a need for a Rural Non-Farm Livelihood Initiative\u00a0(RNFLI) for rural areas. The RNFLI could have as its core the Khadi Village Industries Commission (KVIC) and the restructured and strengthened Small Farmers\u2019 Agri-business Consortium (SFAC) and bring all rural non-farm employment programmes together, in order to generate convergence and synergy\namong them.\nAn Indian Trade Organisation (ITO) should be established to help the Government to operate a Livelihood Security Box and link global policies with local action in a manner beneficial to farmers.\nArticle 243 G of the 11th Schedule of the Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992 entrusts Panchayats with responsibility for agriculture including agricultural extension. They will have to be empowered with the needed information, training and tools for discharging this responsibility.\n\u201cJai Kisan\u201d\n\nMahatma Gandhi preferred to be known as a farmer while signing the Visitor\u2019s Book of the National Dairy Research Institute at Bangalore in 1927. Let us prove worthy of his trust that India will care for its farmers.\n\nRead:\u00a0New Schemes for Farmers\n\nArticle by: Arun Kumar",

    "[CONTENT] #495": "Agricultural marketing reforms in India have been a crucial aspect of transforming the agricultural sector to ensure better returns for farmers, reduce middlemen intervention, and create an efficient marketplace. Read further to know more.\n\nIndia is an agrarian economy with 70% of its population dependent on agriculture. Over the years we have improved our agricultural production which has been a boon. However, finding a market for the marketed surplus and getting fair prices have always been a major challenge. This points out the need for agricultural marketing in the present times.\n\nThe Model Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act and the National Agricultural Market (NAM) are two significant initiatives aimed at modernizing agricultural marketing in the country.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy is agricultural marketing so important?\nHistory of Agricultural Marketing in India\nWhat is a regulated market?\nDrawbacks of regulated markets\nAmendments in APMC Acts\nModel APMC Act 2003: Salient features\nNational Agriculture Market (NAM)\nFeatures of NAM\nChallenges for Agricultural Marketing Reforms\nSummary\nWhy is agricultural marketing so important?\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nAgricultural marketing covers all the activities in the movement of agricultural products from the farms to the consumers.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAdvanced agricultural practices resulted in surplus production which changed the subsistence face of Indian agriculture.\nApproximately 33% of the output of food grains, pulses, and nearly all of the production of cash crops like cotton, sugarcane, oilseeds, etc. are marketed as they remain surplus after meeting the consumption needs of the farmers.\nAs the agriculture sector produces raw materials for many of the other industries, marketing of such commercial products assumes significance.\nIncreased efficiency of the marketing mechanisms would result in the distribution of products at lower prices to consumers having a direct bearing on national income.\nAn improved marketing system will stimulate the growth in the number of agro-based industries mainly in the field of processing.\nHistory of Agricultural Marketing in India\n\nFor a long time, a traditional market system has existed in India. It was characterized by the village sales of agricultural commodities, post-harvest immediate sales by farmers, etc.\n\nIn 1928, the Royal Commission pointed out the problems of traditional marketing such as high marketing costs, unauthorized deductions, and the prevalence of various malpractices. This led to the demand for regulated markets in India.\n\nAncient Period\n\nBarter System: In ancient India, agricultural trade primarily operated on a barter system, with farmers exchanging goods and produce directly.\nLocal Markets: Small local markets, known as \u201chaats\u201d or \u201cshandies,\u201d served as venues for farmers to sell and exchange their agricultural products.\n\nMedieval Period\n\nExpansion of Trade Routes: With the expansion of trade routes during the medieval period, agricultural products gained importance in regional and interregional commerce.\nRole of Middlemen: The emergence of middlemen became more prominent, connecting farmers with distant markets and facilitating trade.\n\nMughal Era\n\nEmpire-Sponsored Markets: The Mughal rulers established markets and trade centers to facilitate agricultural commerce.\nZamindari System: The zamindari system, where revenue collectors were intermediaries between the farmers and the state, influenced agricultural marketing.\n\nBritish Colonial Period\n\nLand Revenue System: The British introduced the Permanent Settlement Act (1793) and the Ryotwari Settlement System (1820s), impacting landownership and agricultural practices.\nRailway Network: The development of the railway network during the mid-19th century facilitated the transportation of agricultural produce to distant markets.\nEstablishment of APMCs: The British introduced the concept of regulated markets through the establishment of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) to regulate and streamline agricultural trade.\n\nPost-Independence Period\n\nAgricultural Reforms: Post-independence, the Indian government initiated various agricultural reforms to address issues of land tenure, production, and marketing.\nGreen Revolution: The Green Revolution in the 1960s led to increased agricultural production, and the need for organized marketing systems became more evident.\nCreation of NAFED: The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) was established in 1958 to promote cooperative marketing.\n\nLiberalization Era (1990s Onward)\n\nMarket Liberalization: Economic liberalization in the 1990s led to changes in agricultural marketing policies, allowing for greater private sector participation.\nIntroduction of Contract Farming: Contract farming gained prominence, with agribusinesses entering into agreements with farmers for the production and marketing of specific crops.\nNational Agricultural Market (NAM): Launched in 2015, the NAM aimed to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities by integrating APMCs through an online platform.\nWhat is a regulated market?\n\nThe regulated market aims at the elimination of unhealthy and unscrupulous practices, reducing market costs and providing benefits to both producers as well as sellers in the market.\n\nPost the independence period in the sixties and seventies, most of the states enacted the Agricultural Produce Market Regulation Acts (APMR Acts). It authorized the States to set up and regulate marketing practices in wholesale markets. The objective was to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce.\n\nDrawbacks of regulated markets\n\nHowever, regulated markets had some drawbacks such as:\n\nUnder this regulation, no exporter or processor could buy directly from farmers. It discouraged the processing and exporting of agricultural products.\nUnder the act, the state Government could only set up markets, thus preventing private players from setting up markets and investing in marketing infrastructure.\nFormation of cartels with links to caste and political networks resulting in price variations.\nAn increased number of middlemen formed a virtual barrier between the farmer and the consumer.\nThe licensing of commission agents in the state-regulated markets has led to the monopoly of licensed traders acting as a major entry barrier for new entrepreneurs.\nThe fragmentation of markets within the State hinders the free flow of agro- commodities from one market area to another and multiple handling of agri-produce and multiple levels of mandi charges end up escalating the prices for the consumers without commensurate benefit to the farmer.\nAmendments in APMC Acts\nConsequently, the inter-ministerial task force on agricultural marketing reforms (2002) recommended the APMC Act be amended to allow for direct marketing and the establishment of agricultural markets by the private and cooperative sectors to provide more efficient marketing and create an environment conducive to private investment.\nIn response, the Union Ministry of Agriculture proposed a model act on agricultural marketing in consultation with State governments for adoption by the States. (Here, you should note that agriculture is a state subject and hence Central government can only give guidelines. It is within the powers of state government to decide whether to make amendments or not.)\nModel APMC Act 2003: Salient features\nAs per the act, the State is divided into several market areas, each of which is administered by a separate Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) which imposes its marketing regulations (including fees).\nSingle Market Fee: The Act recommends a single-point levy of market fees, eliminating multiple fees imposed at different stages of the marketing process.\nDirect Marketing: It allows farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers, processors, exporters, or bulk buyers, bypassing traditional APMC markets.\nElectronic Trading: Facilitates the use of electronic trading platforms to promote transparency and efficiency in the marketing process.\nContract Farming: Encourages contract farming arrangements between farmers and agribusiness firms, providing price assurance to farmers.\nPrice Discovery: The Act facilitates transparent price discovery mechanisms, ensuring fair remuneration for farmers.\nMarket Diversification: Farmers can access a broader market, including national and international buyers, through electronic trading platforms.\nReduced Intermediaries: Direct marketing and contract farming reduce the role of intermediaries, ensuring a higher share of profits for farmers.\nNational Agriculture Market (NAM)\n\nThe motivation for a unified market platform can be traced to the Rashtriya e-Market Services (ReMS), an initiative of Karnataka State Agricultural Marketing Board with National e-Markets Limited (NeML), erstwhile National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) Spot Exchange.\n\nNAM, announced in Union Budget 2014-15, is a pan-India electronic trading portal that seeks to connect existing APMCs and other market yards to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities.\n\nFeatures of NAM\nUnified Market Platform: The NAM provides a common online platform for buyers and sellers, enabling transparent and efficient price discovery.\ne-NAM: The platform operates under the e-NAM (National Agriculture Market) initiative, allowing farmers to list their produce online and receive competitive bids from buyers.\nInterconnected Markets: APMCs across different states are gradually being interconnected through the NAM to create a seamless national market.\nPrice Transparency: The NAM enhances price transparency by providing real-time information on prices and market demand.\nReduced Transaction Costs: Electronic trading reduces transaction costs, benefiting both farmers and buyers.\nMarket Access: Farmers gain access to a larger pool of buyers, potentially improving their bargaining power.\n\nHowever, for a state to be part of NAM, it needs to undertake prior reforms in respect of\n\nA single license is to be valid across the state.\nSingle point levy of market fee.\nProvision for electronic auction as a mode of price discovery.\nChallenges for Agricultural Marketing Reforms\n\nThe model APMC act that promoted the participation of the private sector has not been implemented by all the states and the monopoly of APMC continues.\n\nImplementation Issues: Some states have faced challenges in implementing the provisions of the Model APMC Act effectively.\nResistance to Change: Traditional market participants may resist changes that diminish their role in the marketing process.\nLimited Coverage: The NAM is still in the process of expanding its coverage to include more APMCs and commodities.\nInfrastructure and Connectivity: Challenges related to infrastructure and internet connectivity in rural areas can hinder the effective functioning of the platform.\nSummary\n\nIn current days of mass production and marketing which is being replaced by customer-based or market-driven strategies, an effective marketing extension service is the need of the hour.\n\nThis has added significance in light of the post-WTO scenario. If the Indian farmers have to withstand the possible onslaught of international competitors, both in domestic as well as overseas markets, agricultural marketing services have to be strengthened.\n\nThe history of agricultural marketing reforms in India reflects the country\u2019s economic and social transformations over the centuries. From ancient barter systems to the establishment of APMCs and the advent of digital platforms, the journey has been marked by evolving policies and practices.\n\nToday, as India navigates challenges and embraces technological advancements, the focus remains on creating a more efficient, transparent, and remunerative agricultural marketing system for the benefit of farmers and the economy.\n\nAlso read: Mechanization of Indian Agriculture; Transport and Marketing of agricultural produce and Issues and related constraints\n\nArticle contributed by: Sree Resmi S",

    "[CONTENT] #498": "India is an agrarian country with around 70% of its people depending directly or indirectly upon agriculture. But farmers\u2019 suicides in India is worrying.\n\nAs per the Central Government despite a multi-pronged approach to improving income and social security of farmers, over 12,000 suicides were reported in the agricultural sector every year since 2013. Farmer suicides account for approximately 10% of all suicides in India. (Reference: TOI)\n\nThere is no denying that the menace of farmer\u2019s suicides exists and runs counter to the aspirations of reaping benefits of our demographic dividend. In this article, we are analysing the farmers\u2019 suicides in India and its related data, the reasons and the way forward.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFarmers\u2019 Suicides \u2013 What do the facts say?\nWhat are the reasons behind\u00a0farmers\u2019 suicides in India?\nIs Suicide a matter of economics?\nResponses to farmers\u2019 suicides\nWay Ahead\nFarmers\u2019 Suicides \u2013 What do the facts say?\nThe list includes\u00a0farmers-cultivators and agricultural labourers.\nSeven states account for 87.5% of total suicides in the farming sector in the country. The states are Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana,\u00a0Madhya Pradesh,\u00a0Chhattisgarh,\u00a0Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu 606.\nBoth marginal farmers and small farmers are committing suicide.\nMaharashtra is the worst affected state.\nIronically, Punjab, which benefited most from the Green Revolution, also presents a depressing picture of farmer\u2019s suicides in India. Between 1995-2015, 4687 farmers\u2019 suicides have been reported from the state of Punjab of which 1334 from one Mansa district alone.\nWhat are the reasons behind\u00a0farmers\u2019 suicides in India?\n\nScholars have given various reasons such as monsoon failure, climate change, high debt burdens, government policies, mental health, personal issues and family problems among the reasons for farmers\u2019 suicides in India. Let\u2019s analyse.\n\nThe surge in input costs:\u00a0A major cause of the farmers\u2019 suicides in India has been the increasing burden on the farmers due to inflated prices of agricultural inputs.\u00a0The culmination of these factors is seen in the overall increase in the cost of cultivation, for wheat, the cost at present is three times than it was in 2005.\nCost of chemicals and seeds: Be it the fertilisers, crop protection chemicals or even the seeds for cultivation, farming has become expensive for the already indebted farmers.\nCosts of Agricultural equipment:\u00a0 The input costs, moreover, aren\u2019t limited to the basic raw materials. Using agricultural equipment and machinery like tractors, submersible pumps etc adds to the already surging costs. Besides, these secondary inputs have themselves become less affordable for the small and marginal farmers.\nLabour costs: Likewise, hiring labourers and animals is getting costlier too. While this may reflect an improvement in the socio-economic status of the labourers, driven primarily by MGNERGA and hike in minimum basic income, this has not gone too well with boosting the agriculture sector.\nDistressed due to loans:\nNCRB data points out that in 2474 suicides out of the studied 3000 farmer suicides in 2015 the victims had unpaid loans from local banks. This is clear enough an indication for drawing correlations between the two. Whether or not the banks had been harassing them, however, is a long-drawn debate and needs more specific empirical evidence.\nMoreover, a shift away from the usual trend also revealed that of the loans taken by these farmers, only 9.8% were loaned from money-lenders. Thus the pressure or muscle-power of money-lenders could be far from being a major driving force, as is otherwise perceived.\nAnother source of strong linkages between farmer suicides and indebtedness is reflected from the spread of the two. While Maharashtra had 1293 suicides for indebtedness, Karnataka had 946. Note that both these states saw one of the highest incidences of farmer suicides as well as indebtedness.\nLack of direct integration with the market:\u00a0Although initiatives like the National Agricultural Market and contract farming are helping integrate the farmers\u2019 produce directly with the market, cutting the role of intermediaries, the reality is still lagging behind.\nLack of awareness: The digital divide, as well as the literacy gap, has made the marginal and small farmers particularly vulnerable due to their inability to utilise the positives of government policies. This is reflected in the continued unsustainable cropping practices \u2013 like cultivating sugarcane in water-deficit regions.\nWater crisis: The concentration of these suicides in the water-deficit regions of states like Maharashtra, Karnataka is a manifestation of how the water crisis and thereby failure to meet production demands have intensified the menace. This is particularly true in the backdrop of continued failed monsoons.\nInterstate water disputes:\u00a0What has added to the already prevalent crisis is the unwillingness to cater to each other\u2019s water needs amongst the states. A case in point is the recently resurfaced Kaveri dispute that saw Karnataka and Tamil Nadu battle out water shortage both in and outside the tribunal even to the extent of non-compliance with the tribunal award.\nClimate change has acted as the last nail in the coffin by resulting in furthering of the uncertainties associated with the already uncertain monsoon system and hence agricultural production. While incidents like flash floods have led to crop losses, deferred monsoons have seen production shortfall year-in and year-out\nIndia\u2019s urban consumer-driven economic policies: The political economy of India is driven more by urban consumers than rural producers. This is reflected in the urgency to impose price controls in case of price rise (imposing Minimum Export Prices, bringing items under Essential Commodities etc) and a lacklustre withdrawal once the price is under control. Contrast this with how we have been imposing a minimum import price to secure our steel sector. This differential treatment to primary sector also limits profit margin and thereby hinders farmers\u2019 chances of breaking free from the cycle of indebtedness.\nLoan waivers instead of restructuring, re-investment measures: Our approach of handling farmer indebtedness and hence farmer suicides have been appeasement politics like the recent move by the UP government to waive off Rs 36000 crore worth of loans. Surprisingly this comes at a time when the agricultural yield is expected to be better in the wake of a good monsoon.\nIn essence, the factors sum up to crop failure, unsustainable production and subsequent farmer indebtedness leading to failure of strengthening the economic state of the farmer as the driving force behind these suicides.\nIs Suicide a matter of economics?\n\nThe National Mental Health Association of the USA states that \u201cNo matter the race or age of the person; how rich or poor they are, it is true that most people who commit suicide have a mental or emotional disorder\u201d. Suicide is not a matter of economics.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis is well supported by the data released by World Health Organisation in 2011: while the suicide rate in India, an agrarian economy, was 13 per 100,000; that of industrialised, rich countries were often higher or comparable\u2013 South Korea \u2013 28.5, Japan \u2013 20.1, Russia \u2013 18.2, USA- 12.6, Australia- 12.5, and UK-11.8. (Reference \u2013 Hindustan Times)\n\nResponses to farmers\u2019 suicides\n\nSome of the major relief packages and debt waiver schemes announced by the government are summarised below:\n\n2006 relief package \u2013 primarily aimed at 31 districts in the four states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala with a high relative incidence of farmers suicides.\nAgricultural debt waiver and debt relief scheme, 2008 \u2013\u00a0Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme in 2008 benefited over 36 million farmers at a cost of 65000 crore rupees (US$10 billion). This spending was aimed at the writing of part of loan principal as well as the interest owed by the farmers.\n2013 diversify income sources package \u2013\u00a0In 2013, the Government of India launched a\u00a0Special Livestock Sector and Fisheries Package\u00a0for farmers suicide-prone regions of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. The package was aimed to diversify income sources of farmers.\n\nApart from these Central Government initiatives, there are many efforts from the state governments side like\u00a0Maharashtra Bill to regulate farmer loan terms, 2008 and\u00a0Kerala Farmers\u2019 Debt Relief Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2012.\n\nWay Ahead\n\nPolicies of integrated pest management\u00a0to prevent pest damage \u2013 An all-inclusive approach that integrates biological, chemical, mechanical and physical methodology should be used to prevent crop damage. In this case, seeking inspiration from Vietnam\u2019s no-spray early rule (predatory beetles are sustained for biological pest control, cutting pesticide requirement by 50%) can be a good way to start.\nLower fertilizer costs \u2013 Helping fertiliser industries cut down on costs, through internal funding rather than external borrowing should lower the input costs.\nLeveraging advancements in Science and Technology by ensuring that state seed policies focus on new genotypes, contract farming and sensitization to adverse weather conditions.\nPrecision farming techniques like SRI (Systematic Rice Intensification) must be encouraged.\nFarm equipment policy must focus on imported equipment to provide for cheaper local manufacture, some incentives like grant of duty credit scrips may be tried.\nSubsidies must be rerouted towards capital generation and entrepreneurial Custom Hiring Centers\u00a0(CHCs) and the implementation must be ensured in a timely fashion.\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) must be encouraged in the agricultural sector, particularly towards capacity-building, skill development and the establishment of CHCs.\nInstitutional financing must also be ensured to be adequate and inclusive rather than catering to the elites within the farming community.\nCooperative farming must be promoted amongst small and marginal farmers to ensure that they are not left lurking while the big farmers reap the benefit at their cost.\nDoubling the farmer income by 2022 is a healthy aim, but loan waivers can\u2019t be the answer. Instead, sustainable agriculture that thrives on re-investment & restructuring is the way ahead. The role that the state has been playing is one of emancipation, but what the primary sector and the farmer needs is empowerment.\nDirect interventions:\nEarly-warning signals for unsustainable loans to launch a 2-pronged approach catering to both the burdened farmers as well as stressed banks.\nOptions for restructuring loans must be used wherever possible.\nInsurance claim settlements must be speedy and just.\nDistrict wise list of indebted farmers and efforts in de-stressing them through counselling and other alternative mechanisms should be tried.\nNABARD and local administration must take control of the situation and play a greater role in curbing farmers\u2019 suicides.\nInnovative efforts like Crowdfunding can be employed through the involvement of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).\nEfforts like Agro-Climatic zoning, education through DD Kisan, Soil Health Card Scheme, various crop insurance and facilitative schemes like PM Krishi Sinchayi Yojana will go a long way in helping out\nCommunity-led awareness must be taken employing a role model approach highlighting progress of farmers who have benefited from sustainable & climate-tailored agricultural practices\n\nAlso read:\u00a0\n\nSuicide Prevention Policy\nNew Schemes for Farmers\n\nArticle by: S S Naik, with inputs from ClearIAS Team",

More than 50% of the Indian population work in Agriculture-related activities. If there are good food processing industries in India, raw materials like grains or meat can be converted into food for domestic and foreign consumption.\nFood processing units act as a link between agriculture and industries.\nFood processing industries can absorb a major share of workers from the agriculture sector, who face disguised unemployment. It can lead to better productivity and GDP growth.\nFood processing prevents food wastage and helps in attaining food security.\nProcessed food requires less space for storage.\nProcessed food can be exported. This may help us in getting foreign exchange reserves.\nScope and Significance of Food Processing Industries in India\n\nWhat is the scope of India in the food processing industry? (Have you ever wondered why UPSC specifically mentioned food processing as a topic in Mains syllabus? \u2013 Because it is a sector that has huge potential for growth in the future!)\n\nThe Indian food industry is heading for huge growth, increasing its contribution to the world food trade every year due to its immense potential for value addition, particularly within the food processing industry.\n\nIndian food and grocery market is the world\u2019s sixth-largest, with retail contributing 70% of the sales.\n\nThe Indian food processing industry accounts for 32% of the country\u2019s total food market. It is one of the largest industries in India and is ranked fifth in terms of production, consumption, export, and expected growth.\n\nMajor points:\n\nIndia\u2019s position as a major food producer: India ranks 1st in the production of \u2013 milk, ginger, banana, guava, papaya, mango, etc. It ranks 2nd in the production of rice, wheat, potato, sugarcane, cashew nut, tea, etc. It is among the top 5 countries in the production of coffee, tobacco, spices, seeds, etc. With such a huge raw material base, we can easily become the leading supplier of food items in the world.\nResource advantage of India: Different soil types and different climate types for the cultivation of diverse food crops, long coastal lines suitable for fishing, a huge resource of domestic animals, etc.\nIncreasing employment: Expected to create more than 10 lakh new jobs.\nCurbing Migration: Employs in rural areas, hence reducing migration from rural to urban. Resolves issues of urbanization.\nCurbing food inflation: Removes issues of wastage or middle man. Curbs food inflation. Indirect relief on non-food inflation too.\nCrop Diversification: Because of the long shelf life, farmers can diversify their products.\nThe demand potential: Expected to reach 250b$ turnout by 2015 and 350b$ by 2020. Youth population, middle class, rising income, nuclear families, media penetration, etc. cited as positive factors.\nGovernment initiatives to boost food processing: Various government initiatives like attracting FDI, reduction in excise duties, etc. have boosted food processing.\nThe future driver of Indian growth: Food processing corresponds to around 10% of GDP in the agriculture-manufacturing sector. It has the potential for more.\n\nAlso read: Blue food\n\nLocation of food industries in India\n\nIndia has more than 35000 registered units. But majorities of the food processing factories are concentrated in the coastal states ( one reason being, accessibility to marine food processing)\n\nMajor coastal states include Andhra, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat, Punjab and WB. Non-coastal states include UP, Punjab, etc.\n\nMajor segments of food processing\nFruits and Vegetables.\nMilk and Milk Products.\nMeat and Poultry.\nMarine Products.\nGrain Processing.\nConsumer Food.\nUpstream and Downstream requirements of food processing industries\n\nUpstream stage: The upstream stage of the production process involves searching for and extracting raw materials. The upstream part of the production process does not do anything with the material itself, such as processing the material. This part of the process simply finds and extracts the raw material. Thus, any industry that relies on the extraction of raw materials commonly has an upstream stage in its production process.\n\nDownstream stage:\u00a0The downstream stage in the production process involves processing the materials collected during the upstream stage into a finished product. The downstream stage further includes the actual sale of that product to other businesses, governments, or private individuals. The downstream process has direct contact with customers through the finished product.\n\nUpstream requirements\nAccessibility to raw materials.\nModern extraction techniques.\nGood linkages with farmers.\nStorage facilities for raw materials like Grains, Meat, Fish, etc.\nQuality testing facilities.\nTransport facilities.\nWorkforce.\nDownstream requirements\nLatest processing techniques.\nLatest processing machinery.\nQuality testing facilities.\nOrganized retail stores for faster distribution.\nWorkforce.\nSupply Chain Management\n\nSupply chain management (SCM) is the management of the flow of goods. It includes the movement and storage of raw materials, inventory, and finished goods from the point of origin to the point of consumption.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the case of Supply Chain Management for the Food Processing Industry. Raw materials like grains, raw meat, fish, etc. are collected from different sources. These sources may do preliminary processing of these to make components of a food product before passing over them to the main manufacturer through many middlemen. The manufacturer does the final processing of these components to make the food product. This completes only the first stage of supply management.\n\nNow the finished product has to be delivered to the consumer. Here also there will be several middlemen and stages. The manufacturer normally hands over the food product to a wholesale dealer. The wholesaler passes the product to a retailer from where the consumer buys the processed food item for his personal use.\n\nThus, Supply Chain Management is the management of the upstream and downstream value-added flow of materials from suppliers\u2192 company\u2192 retailer\u2192 final consumers.\n\nIf there are good Supply Chain Management practices in a country, then it will boost the economy as a whole. Good supply chain links help farmers, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers. Everyone in the supply chain link will get inputs at a faster rate, at the right time, and at a cheaper cost.\n\nObstacles in the growth of food processing Industries\nSmall-size companies: Indian food processing companies are small and can\u2019t compete with global giants that invest heavily in R&D.\nLack of good laboratories in India: Food export to the US and EU demands high-quality standards. India lacks good laboratories to check heavy metals and other toxic contaminants in food.\nLack of skilled workforce. We have only a few graduates in Food Technology.\nLack of the right vision and support from the government at the right time.\nLack of good transportation facilities. Roads are overburdened.\nLack of storage facilities and good production techniques.\nLack of organized retail.\nLimitations in supply chains.\nLimitations in the quality.\nLack of modern regulations.\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nThe government of India is now encouraging food processing industries by providing :\n\n100% FDI in this sector.\nAgri Export Zones.\nNational Mission on Agriculture.\nMajor Schemes by the Government\nVision 2015 for food processing: The Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has sponsored a study to suggest a roadmap for the growth of the food processing sector. M/S Rabo Bank has conducted a study and submitted a Vision Document suggesting a strategy & action plan for the food processing sector in India namely Vision 2015. Vision Document suggested a strategy to ensure faster growth of the sector. The adopted Vision 2015 provides for enhancing the level of processing of perishables from 6% to 20%, enhancing value addition from 20% to 35%, and increasing India\u2019s share in the global food trade from 1.5% to 3% by the year 2015. To achieve these targets, an investment of Rs.100 thousand crores was estimated by the year 2015, out of which Rs.10,000 crores was to come from the Government. Accordingly, the Ministry of FPI formulated its 11th Plan schemes to attract the required investment in the sector.\nNational Mission on Food Processing: The MOFPI launched a new Centrally Sponsored Scheme(CSS) \u2013 National Mission- on Food Processing (NMFP) on 1st April 2012 for implementation through States/UTs. The NMFP envisages the establishment of a National Mission as well as corresponding Missions at the State and District level. The basic objective of NMFP is the decentralization of implementation of food processing-related schemes to ensure substantial participation of State Governments/UTs. The mission is expected to improve the Ministry\u2019s outreach significantly in terms of planning, supervision, and monitoring of various schemes apart from playing a more meaningful role in policy formation.\nMega food parks: The Scheme of Mega Food Park aims to provide a mechanism to link agricultural production to the market by bringing together farmers, processors, and retailers to ensure maximizing value addition, minimizing wastage, increasing farmers\u2019 income, and creating employment opportunities, particularly in the rural sector. The Mega Food Park Scheme is based on the \u201cCluster\u201d approach and envisages a well-defined Agri/ horticultural-processing zone containing state-of-the-art processing facilities with support infrastructure and a well-established supply chain.\nModernization of abattoirs: The scheme aims at providing facilities for scientific and less painful slaughtering, chilling, effluent treatment plants, by-product utilization, water, and power with required sanitary/phytosanitary conditions for the modernization of abattoirs. Modernization of abattoirs will also augment the essential supply base of hygienic raw materials to the meat processing industry, both for domestic consumption and exports, besides discouraging unauthorized slaughtering. The scheme of Setting up/ Modernization of Abattoirs provides for the induction of private capital, better technology, and backward and forward linkages. The scheme also provides for the implementation of projects preferably under PPP mode with the involvement of local bodies and has the flexibility for the involvement of private investors/exporters on a BOO/BOT/JV basis.\nCold Chain Infrastructure: The Scheme for Integrated Cold Chain, Value Addition, and Preservation Infrastructure aims to encourage the setting up of cold chain facilities to provide integrated cold chain and preservation infrastructure facilities without breaking from the farm gate to the consumer.\nR&D, QA, Codex, and Promotion: The scheme for Quality Assurance, Codex, R&D, and Other Promotional Activities is being implemented to create an infrastructure of food testing laboratories in the country to establish a quality monitoring system for food processing, implement HACCP/ISO22000, ISO14000/GHP/GMP, and other quality management systems and to promote research and development for innovative products and process etc.\nBoards and Institutions\n\nNIFTEM \u2013 National Institute of Food Technology and Entrepreneurial Management.\nIGPB \u2013 Indian Grape Processing Board.\nIICPT \u2013 Indian Insitute of Crop Processing Technology.\nNMPPB \u2013 National Meat and Poultry Processing Board.\n\nThe Present Status and Future of Food Processing Industries in India\n\u00a0The estimated worth of the Indian Food Processing Industry is 121 b dollars.\nIndia has already witnessed the green and white revolution ie Agriculture and Milk.\nNow the focus is on the Pink Revolution: Meat and poultry sector.\nThe packaged food sector in India is likely to double in 2015 to touch 30 b dollars.\nIndia is currently the world\u2019s second-largest producer of food (next only to China).

    "[CONTENT] #507": "What is the background and history of land reforms in India? What is the regional variation in the implementation of land reforms? Read further to know more.\n\nLand reforms in India usually refer to redistribution of land from the rich to the poor.\n\nLand reforms are often connected with the re-distribution of agricultural land and hence it is related to agrarian reforms too.\n\nLand reforms include regulation of ownership, operation, leasing, sales, and inheritance of land (indeed, the redistribution of the land itself requires legal changes).\n\nAlso read: Tebhaga Movement\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBackground and History of Land Reforms in India\nStates which implemented land reforms in India\nThe other sides of land reforms\nArguments in Favor of Land Reforms\nArguments Against Land Reforms\nReference:\nBackground and History of Land Reforms in India\n\nIn any country, the basis of all economic activity is the land. If we examine the history of India, though there are instances of considering land as private property by individuals who had control over it, the practice of communities like that of tribals with collective ownership of land stands out.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nLand like many other gifts of nature was considered free for all by many communities who didn\u2019t bother to fix boundaries for private ownership. However, the colonial rule by the British saw a dramatic shift in the land ownership pattern of India.\n\nLand of many tribal/forest communities was seized by British cultivators and Zamindars, and land tax was widely collected through systems like Zamindari, Ryotwari, or Mahalwari.\n\nA rich-minority-landowning class and a poor-landless-peasant class became symbols of Indian agrarian society. As the ownership of the land for some reason or other stayed with the rich Zamindar class, they became more powerful year after year, accumulating wealth.\n\nThe peasants, who actually cultivated the land, were often in poverty and remained landless. When India adopted socialistic principles after independence, equality in all spheres \u2013 social, economic, and political was envisioned.\n\nLand reforms are essential steps towards social and economic equality as land is a fundamental asset needed for the healthy development of an individual. As per the Indian constitution, land reform comes under the list of state subjects, and hence the responsibility for bringing up regulations for effecting land reforms lies with individual states.\n\nStates which implemented land reforms in India\n\nZamindari Abolition Act was passed by UP, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, etc. Surplus lands were confiscated from zamindars. As in the Golaknath case, the Supreme Court ruled that the provisions of the Zamindari Abolition Act contradicted Article 31 of the Indian Constitution, the parliament took steps to repeal Article 31. Later Land Ceilings Act was passed by different states.\n\nSuccessful legislation for redistribution of land with ceilings on private land property happened only in a few states. The most notable and successful land reforms happened in the states of Kerala and West Bengal (Operation Barga).\n\nOnly pockets of India like Jammu and Kashmir witnessed commendable steps in land reform but attempts in states like Andra Pradesh, Madya Pradesh, and Bihar led to clashes within the communities.\n\nThough the Central Land Reforms Committee has laid guidelines for land ceilings, there was a purposeful delay in the implementation of land reform policy in many states, giving a gap for transactions to escape the tooth of land reform laws.\n\nThe other sides of land reforms\n\nLand reforms have an angle other than cultivation purposes. The redistribution of land becomes a necessity often for development and manufacturing purposes too. This necessitates a proper land policy, which gives due importance to nature, development, and inclusion.\n\nDeeper structural reforms will ensure that the exercise of land redistribution actually becomes meaningful, enabling small farmers to turn their plots into productive assets. When every citizen of the country enjoys the benefits of ownership of land, it can lead to social and economic upliftment.\n\nThere are arguments in favor of and against land reforms.\n\nArguments in Favor of Land Reforms\nEquity \u2013 now the majority of land in India is enjoyed by a minority of landlords.\nThe inverse relationship between land size and efficiency \u2013 the smaller the land, the better will be the productivity and efficiency.\nOwner cultivation is more efficient than share-cropping.\nArguments Against Land Reforms\nIf centrally managed large agricultural land is divided among individual private owners, the peasants who take it up may not be efficient enough to individually carry out the cultivation.\nResults in Fragmentation of land and pockets of inefficiency. For large-scale cultivation, the fragmentation of land normally won\u2019t help (this has another side too \u2013 see the inverse relationship).\nEvidence suggests that land reforms had a negative effect on poverty.\nLand reforms have led to economic decline and food insecurity in countries like Zimbabwe.\n\nAlso read: RERA Act 2016\n\nReference:\nLand Reform in India by Kaushik Basu\nLand Reforms \u2013 Planning Commission\nLand Reforms \u2013 Issue and Challenges \u2013 Food First\nLand Policy in India \u2013 FAO\nLand Reforms in India \u2013 Hub Pages",

Proper land statistics and land accounting through ULPIN will help develop a land bank and lead toward an Integrated Land Information Management System (ILIMS).\n\nBenefits are to ensure uniqueness in all transactions and keep the land records always up-to-date; a link of all property transactions established; delivery of citizen services of land records through the single window; sharing of land records data across departments, financial institutions, and all stakeholders; and standardization at data and application-level would bring in effective integration and interoperability across departments.\nThe pilot test has been successfully carried out in 11 States namely Bihar, Haryana, Jharkhand, Odisha, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh and Goa.\nChallenges and Progress\n\nThe implementation of NLRMP faces several challenges, including technological barriers, resistance to change among the staff managing land records, and the need for massive public awareness campaigns to educate landowners about the benefits of the program. Despite these challenges, significant progress has been made in many states, with digital land records and services being made available online to the public.\n\nThe successful implementation of the NLRMP/DILRMP can significantly transform land governance in India, making the system more transparent, efficient, and user-friendly. This transformation not only aids in reducing disputes over land ownership but also facilitates the ease of doing business by making property verification processes quicker and more reliable.\n\nRead: Land Digitization in India",

CACP submits two separate reports for Kharif and rabi seasons and based on these, centre fixes MSPs twice a year.\n\nCACP considers the following three costs while recommending MSP-\n\nA2 which covers all the cash and kind expenses of the farmers.\nA2+FL which takes into account the estimated value of the unpaid labour of family members.\nC2 which includes A2+FL along with the interests foregone.\nCrops getting Minimum Support Price\n\nAs of now, 23 crops are being supported by the centre by fixing of MSP. They belong to the family of cereals (7), pulses (5), oilseeds (7) and commercial crops (4).\n\nThe crops are:\n\nPaddy\nJowar\nBajra\nMaize\nRagi\nTur (Arhar)\nMoong\nUrad\nCotton\nGroundnut\nSunflower seed\nSoya bean\nSesamum\nNiger seed\nWheat\nBarley\nGram\nMasur (Lentil)\nRapeseed and Mustard\nSafflower\nToria\nJute\nCoconut \u2013 Copra and De-Husked Coconut\n\nNote:\u00a0Subscribe ClearIAS YouTube Channel\u00a0to learn from more free videos.\n\nWhy MSP is needed?\nTo safeguard farmers from the market price fluctuations.\nThe prices of farm commodities are dependent on various factors such as good harvest season which leads to fall in prices.\nIn such cases, farmers might not prefer to sow the aforesaid crop next season. MSPs would encourage farmers to sow these crops and thereby maintain a healthy supply.\nFacts you should know about the Minimum Support Price\nAlthough the government announces MSP for 23 crops, only 2-3 crops are effectively procured.\nThe production of rice and wheat greatly increased at the expense of other crops like pulses.\nThe significant increase in buffer stocks adds up to huge storage and transportation costs.\nDoing away with MSP without taking the farmers into confidence is not the right step.\nAlso, other steps like improving the irrigation facilities, implementing land reforms and access to technology are necessary to make farming more remunerative to farmers.\nImplementing various suggestions given by Swaminathan commission would be a right step instead of considering MSP as the panacea.\nMarket Intervention Scheme\n\nIt is a price support mechanism for those horticultural commodities which are not supported by MSP.\n\nThe commodities covered are mostly perishable in nature. The scheme is similar to MSP but is temporary in nature.\n\nIt is implemented for a limited period on the request of the concerned state government.\n\nThe objective of this scheme is to protect the growers of horticultural crops from distress sales in the event of a fall in prices.\n\nRecommendations of the Swaminathan Commission\n\nMS Swaminathan commission was constituted by the centre in 2004 for recommending various measures to alleviate farmer\u2019s distress. NCF submitted five reports in total and recommending various measures like-\n\nInsertion of Agriculture in the concurrent list of the constitution.\nAddressing the issue of land reforms and inequalities in landholdings.\nIncreasing the investments in agriculture-related infrastructure.\nEstablishment of soil testing laboratories for detection of micronutrient deficiency.\nEnsuring the availability of formal credit to the farmers.\nSetting up of Village Knowledge Centres or Gyan Chaupals.\nEnsuring the availability of farm inputs at affordable rates.\nRestructuring the microfinance policies.\nFocused Market Intervention Scheme for live-saving crops.\nInclusion of millets and other nutritious cereals in PDS.\nInvesting in post-harvest management to reduce the losses and facilitation of direct farmer- consumer linkage.\nMSP support to be provided to crops other than for paddy and wheat.\nSteps to be taken for forming a single Indian market which promotes grading, branding and packaging.\nPreserving the right of access to non-timber forest produce.\nFarm Bills and MSP\n\nThe centre has recently passed two farm bills namely,\n\nThe Farmers\u2019 Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020\nThe Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020\n\nOther than these two bills, another bill, The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act,2020 has also been a bone of contention between the farmers and the centre.\n\nKey Features of the Farm Bill\n\nThe first bill i.e., the Farmers\u2019 produce trade and commerce bill gives more choice to the farmers regarding their produce. It allows the farmers to sell their farm produce outside the government regulated mandis or the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). APMC as an institution became obsolete and is fixing low prices for the produce. This is leading the farmers to resort to distress sales in the event of bumper production. Hence, this scheme allows farmers to choose the best price for their products and sell accordingly.\n\nThe second bill i.e., the Farmers\u2019 agreement on price assurance and farm services bill has provisions regarding the contract farming. It gives the farmers an opportunity to strike a deal with corporates even before the production. This shifts the risk from farmers onto the businessmen and also the farmers will be assured of a fixed price.\n\nBenefits of the Farm Bills\nHigher prices for farmers for their produce since restrictions to sell in the physical premises of mandis has been done away with.\nThey provide for a 3level dispute settlement mechanism- conciliation board, sub-divisional magistrate and appellate authority.\nA guaranteed price for the product to be mentioned in the agreement between farmers and businessmen.\nDirect selling of the products through electronic trading is also permitted.\nThe State governments are prohibited from levying market fees for trading outside the trade area.\nStrict rules and fines for violation of agreements are mentioned in the bills.\nDrawbacks of the Farm Bills\nNo clarity or mention regarding the MSP in the proposed laws.\nNo involvement of Judiciary in the dispute settlement mechanism.\nFarmers\u2019 concern that their interests would be ignored in case of disputes with large corporate houses.\nUnder contract farming, there is a fear of becoming slaves to corporate buyers on one\u2019s own land.\nPrevious Year UPSC Questions from the topic Minimum Support Price (MSP)\n\nQn 1) Consider the following:\u00a0(UPSC CSE Prelims 2018)\n\nAreca nut\nBarley\nCoffee\nFinger millet\nGroundnut\nSesamum\nTurmeric\n\nThe Cabinet Committee on Economic Affair, has announced the Minimum Support Price for which of the above?\n\n1, 2, 3 and 7 only\n2, 4, 5 and 6 only\n1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 only\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) 2, 4, 5 and 6 only\n\nQuestion 2) What do you mean by minimum support price?

It plays a crucial role in ensuring food security for millions of Indians. In this post, let us cover the Public Distribution System (PDS) in India.\n\nWe all need food grains for consumption. From where do you purchase food grains? \u00a0Is there any government mechanism apart from private shops for the delivery of food grains?\n\nThe Public Distribution System is a critical social welfare program in India, but it continues to face challenges related to implementation and coverage.

Over the years, the term PDS\u00a0 has become synonymous with the term \u2018food security\u2019 and is also an important part of the Government\u2019s policy for the management of the food economy in the country.\n\nInfo bit: PDS comes under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution.\n\nTill 1992, PDS was a general entitlement scheme for all consumers without any specific target. But in 1992, PDS became RPDS (Revamped PDS) focusing the poor families, especially in the far-flung, hilly, remote, and inaccessible areas. In 1997 RPDS became TPDS (Targeted PDS) which established\u00a0 Fair Price Shops for the distribution of food grains at subsidized rates.\n\nThe objectives of the PDS are:\n\nTo provide essential food items at affordable prices to vulnerable sections of the population.\nTo stabilize prices of essential commodities in the market.\nTo prevent hoarding and black marketing of food grains.\nTo reduce hunger and malnutrition among economically disadvantaged communities.\n\nAlso read: Breakfast scheme: Feeding the future\n\nSignificance of TPDS\n\nIn the People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India case, the Supreme Court contended that the \u201cright to food\u201d is essential to the right to life as provided in Article 21 of the Constitution.\n\nIn line with this Parliament passed the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in 2013. The NFSA seeks to make the right to food a legal entitlement by providing subsidized food grains to almost two-thirds of the population.\n\nIt relies on the existing Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) mechanism to deliver these entitlements\n\nWhy is PDS important?\nFood grains to the poor, at prices lower than the price of food grains at private shops.\nFood grains are directly purchased from farmers, assuring\u00a0farmers with a\u00a0greater price.\nThe PDS provides essential commodities such as rice, wheat, sugar, and kerosene oil. The specific commodities and their quantities may vary from state to state.\nThe PDS primarily targets below-poverty-line (BPL) families, although the identification of beneficiaries has evolved.\nSome states have expanded the PDS to include Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) beneficiaries, who are considered the poorest of the poor.\nAdditionally, the National Food Security Act (NFSA) of 2013 extended PDS coverage to a broader category of beneficiaries, including priority households and eligible households.\n\nAlso read: 100+ Government Schemes and the Implementing Ministries\n\nHow does the Public Distribution System (PDS) function?\n\nThe steps involved are (1) Procurement of food grains (2) Storage of food grains (3) Allocation for families (4) Transportation of food grains.\n\nProcurement of foodgrains\nThe center is responsible for procuring food grains from farmers at a Minimum Support Price (MSP).\nThe MSP is the price at which the FCI purchases the crop directly from farmers; generally, the MSP is higher than the market price.\nThis is intended to provide price support to farmers and incentivize production.\nCommission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) sets the MSP\nProcurement: Two types of procurement, Centralised Procurement, and decentralized procurement.\nCentralized procurement is carried out by the FCI (Food Corporation of India) where FCI buys crops directly from farmers.\nDecentralized procurement is a central scheme under which 10 states/Union Territories procure food grains for the central pool at MSP on behalf of FCI.\n\u00a0Why decentralized procurement?\u00a0The purpose is to encourage local procurement of food grains and minimize expenditure incurred when transporting grains from surplus to deficit states over long distances.\n\nProcurement issues:\n\nOpen-ended Procurement: All incoming grains are accepted even if buffer stock is filled creating a shortage in the open market. The recent implementation of the Nation Food Security Act would only increase the quantum of procurement resulting in higher prices for grains.\nThe gap between required and existing storage capacity.\nStorage of food grains\n\nAccording to the storage guidelines of the FCI, food grains are normally stored in covered godowns and silos. In case FCI has insufficient storage space, it hires space from various agencies such as central and state warehousing corporations (CWC, SWC), state government agencies, and private parties.\n\nStorage issues:\n\nInadequate storage capacity with FCI.\nFood grains rotting or damaging on the CAP or Cover & Plinth storage.\nAllocation of foodgrains\nThe central government allocates food grains from the central pool to the state governments at uniform Central Issue Price\u00a0(CIP) for distribution through PDS.\nIdentification of poor people- The onus is on the state Government to identify the eligible households in each state. Apart from the allocation of food grains within the State, the issue of Ration Cards and supervision of the functioning of Fair Price Shops (FPSs), etc. rest with the State Governments.\nAllocation for BPL and AAY(Antyodaya Anna Yojana \u2013poorest among the BPL families) families is done based on the number of identified households.\n\nHowever, allocation for APL families is made based on\n\nThe availability of food grain stocks in the central pool\nThe past lifting of food grains by a state from the central pool.\n\nIssues with the allocation of food grains:\n\nInaccurate identification of beneficiaries.\nIllicit Fair Price shops: The shop owners have created a large number of bogus cards or ghost cards(cards for nonexistent people) to sell food grains in the open market.\nTransportation of food grains to FPSs\n\nThe responsibility of distributing food grains is shared between the centre and states. The centre, specifically FCI, is responsible for the interstate transport of food grains from procuring to consuming states, as well as delivering grains to the state godowns. Once FCI transports grains to the state depots, distribution of food grains to end consumers is the responsibility of state governments\n\nIssues with Transportation:\n\nLeakage and diversion of food grains during transportation.\n\nAlso read: Census\n\nPublic Distribution System (PDS) reforms\n\nThe need of the hour is PDS reforms to ensure that public distribution functions the way it is intended.\n\nEnd-to-end computerization would bring transparency to the whole process. It would help to prevent leakages and diversion of food grains to a great extent.\n\nThe different types of reforms undertaken by different states are:\n\nAdhaar Linked and digitized ration cards: This allows online entry and verification of beneficiary data. It also enables online tracking of monthly entitlements and off-take of food grains by beneficiaries.\nComputerized Fair Price Shops: FPS automated by installing \u2018Point of Sale\u2019 to swap the ration card. It authenticates the beneficiaries and records the quantity of subsidized grains given to a family.\nDBT: Under the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme, cash is transferred to the beneficiaries\u2019 account instead of the foodgrains subsidy component. They will be free to buy food grains from anywhere in the market. For taking up this model, prerequisites for the States/UTs would be to complete the digitization of beneficiary data and seed the Aadhaar and bank account details of beneficiaries. It is estimated that cash transfers alone could save the exchequer Rs.30,000 crore every year.\nUse of GPS technology: Use of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to track the movement of trucks carrying foodgrains from state depots to FPS which can help to prevent diversion.\nSMS-based monitoring: Allows monitoring by citizens so they can register their mobile numbers and send/receive SMS alerts during dispatch and arrival of TPDS commodities\nUse of web-based citizens portal: Public Grievance Redressal Machineries, such as a toll-free number for call centres to register complaints or suggestions.\n\nThe PDS has undergone various reforms, including computerization of records, Aadhar-based authentication, and the use of technology to track beneficiaries and prevent leakage.\n\nThe \u201cOne Nation, One Ration Card\u201d initiative aims to enable beneficiaries to access their PDS entitlements from any FPS in the country, regardless of their home state.\n\nAlso read: Core of the Core Schemes, Core Schemes, and Major Central Sector Schemes in Union Budget 2018\n\nSummary\n\nThe government has achieved significant milestones in the PDS reforms. As part of the implementation of NFSA, almost all states have undertaken PDS reforms.\n\nThe PDS has faced challenges related to the identification of beneficiaries, leakage, corruption, and inefficiencies in the distribution system.\n\nInadequate storage and logistics infrastructure can lead to food grain wastage.\nMarket prices of food commodities can fluctuate, impacting the effectiveness of price stabilization efforts.\n\nThe PDS is a critical social welfare program in India, but it continues to face challenges related to implementation and coverage. Ongoing efforts to modernize and improve the system are aimed at making it more efficient, transparent, and accountable while ensuring that food reaches those in need.\n\nAlso read: Yojana and Kurukshetra \u2013 Should You Read These Magazines for UPSC CSE Preparation?\n\nArticle contributed by: Sree Resmi S",

It measures the short-term changes in the volume of production of a basket of industrial products. The current IIP basket covers 682 representative items.\n\nMining (61 items) \u2013\u00a014.16% weight\nManufacturing (620 items) \u2013\u00a075.53% weight\nElectricity (1 item) \u2013 10.32% weight.\n\nNote: Even though the United Nations Statistics Division suggests to also include Gas steam, Air conditioning supply, Water supply, sewage, Waste Management and Remediation activities in the IIP, due to data constraints Indian IIP only covers three sectors \u2013 mining, manufacturing and electricity. These three are called broad sectors.\n\nIIP also gives us an idea about use-based sectors \u2013 another classification. User-based sectors include Basic Goods, Capital Goods and Intermediate Goods.\n\nThe weighted arithmetic mean of quantity relatives with weights being allotted to various items in proportion to value added by manufacture in the base year by using Laspeyres\u2019 formula.\n\nCore Industries and IIP 2004\n\nCoal, Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Refinery Products, Steel, Cement and Electricity are known as Core Industries. The eight Core Industries comprise nearly 37.9 % of the weight of items included in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). The 8 core industries and their relative weight in IIP are as below:\n\nCoal\u00a0(weight: 4.38 %).\nCrude Oil\u00a0(weight: 5.22 %).\nNatural Gas (weight: 1.71 %).\nRefinery Products (weight: 5.94%).\nFertilizers\u00a0(weight: 1.25%).\nSteel\u00a0(weight: 6.68%).\nCement\u00a0(weight: 2.41%).\nElectricity\u00a0(weight: 10.32%)\nAnnual Survey of Industries (ASI) Vs Index of Industrial Production (IIP)\n\nThe Industrial Output data is captured and monitored, primarily, through two statistical activities \u2013 the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) and Index of Industrial Production (IIP).\n\nASI\nASI is calculated on an annual basis\nThe ASI has been conducted under the Collection of Statistics Act, since 1959.\nThe objective is to obtain comprehensive and detailed statistics of the industrial sector to estimate the contribution of registered manufacturing industries as a whole to the national income.\nASI data is based on the actual book of accounts and other documents maintained by registered factories.\nIIP\nIIP is calculated on a monthly basis.\nData for IIP are collected by various source agencies under different Acts/statutes.\nThe IIP is compiled on the basis of data sourced from 16 ministries/ administrative departments.\nIndustry vs Manufacturing\n\nThough often interchangeably used, the terms industry and manufacturing are different.\n\nThe term industry is comprehensive and may be considered as a superset of manufacturing. Industry, in general, refers to an economic activity that is concerned with the production of goods, extraction of minerals and sometimes even the provision of services. Thus we have the iron and steel industry (production of goods), the coal mining industry (extraction of coal) and the tourism industry (service provider).\n\nSo what is manufacturing then?\n\nManufacturing: The production of goods in large quantities after processing from raw materials to more valuable products is called manufacturing.\n\nIndustry = Manufacturing + Mining + Electricity +\u00a0much more.\n\nShare of the Industrial Sector in the total GDP of India\n\nThe total Industrial sector has only around 27 per cent share of the total GDP of India.

Thus Indian Bureau of Mines won\u2019t cover them\nThe number of source agencies\t15\t14\tData on \u2018Iodised Salt\u2019 will be provided by DIPP. Because, the\u00a0 Salt Commissioner is not in a position to supply Salt production data after the abolition of Salt Cess Act, 1953 in Finance Bill 2016.\nUse-Based Classification changes\tThere are two new categories introduced in the new series namely \u201cPrimary goods\u201d and \u201cInfrastructure/ Construction goods\u201d replaced the category \u201cBasic goods\u201d in use-based classification.\nWorking in Progress\tMany items have production span of more than one month for which data will now be reported on \u2018work in progress\u2019 so that continuous production is accounted. It will address the fluctuations in production data.\nWhy was a revise needed in the IIP series?\nThe amendment in item list brings the production data of products that are relevant according to the changing time. For example, the production of colour TV picture tubes holds little relevance in a time of LCD, LED and OMLED technology. Yet fall in colour TV picture tube affected the IIP.\nChange in series maintains representativeness of the items and producing entities\nand also address issues relating to the continuous flow of production data.\nBy changing base year to 2011-12, now GDP, WPI and IIP, the three major indices; are in sync.\nAlso, a change in base year is done to shave off the base effect. It increases the sensitivity of the index to changes over the previous year.\nThe IIP was criticised for being unable to get the true picture. It focussed on redundant items while many vital aspects were left untouched, like the renewable energy production. Therefore a drastic change became a necessity.\nWhat are the impacts after IIP revision?\nA Technical Review Committee, chaired by Secretary, Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, is being set up to facilitate dynamic revision of the item list and panel of factories. It will meet once a year to amend the list. It will make the IIP dynamic, time relevant and an organic index.\nThe average industrial output growth for last five fiscal was 1.42%, as per 2004-05 series. It increased to 3.82% according to the new IIP series (2011-12).\nAlso, the old series showed 0.7% expansion in 2016-17. While the new series showed 5% rate of growth till March 2017 ( 2016-17).\nWhat are the limitations of IIP?\nQuality Vs Quantity: IIP is still reliant on quantity based growth projection. It faces problem in assessing the growth of high-value, low output products. Take the example of two cars, Maruthi Alto and Mercedes Benz. The value of one Mercedes Benz is more than 10 Maruthi Alto. Yet, a production increase of 2 units of Benz would be equal to 2 Maruthi Alto. So a little fall in the mass produced Alto will negate the increase in Benz production.\nUnorganised Sector:\u00a0The unorganised sector is still out of reach of the index. According to the employment and unemployment survey (EUS 2011-12, conducted by NSSO), employment in the informal component is to be about 75 per cent of total usual status employment (principal and subsidiary) in the rural areas and 69 per cent in urban areas. So IIP leaves about 70% of employment providing sector (i.e., unorganised sector) out of its reach.\nManufacturing Sector and PMI:\u00a0While assessing manufacturing sector, IIP still lacks the sensitivity that PMI (Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index- by Nikkei) is supposed to have. PMI also covers service sector.\nWhat is the future?\n\nWe are moving through an era of disruptive technology, where the boundaries between service and manufacturing are becoming hazy with each moment. With the fourth industrial revolution approaching, there is a need to change the way of assessing parameters of production and its direction. The formation of Technical Review committee is a good step but merely changing the items won\u2019t be enough in this fast changing world. The need is to redefine IIP where it covers not just production flow, but also its quality, impact and sustainability. It\u2019s sometimes joked that only if we have a Richter scale to judge economic quakes. Well, IIP\u2019s future lies in becoming that scale.\n\nArticle by: Alok Singh",

But if contribution to GDP is taken as the parameter, India is predominantly a service economy, and the service sector has near 60 percent share of total GDP. Whatever way we see India, there is no doubt that India lags behind in one sector: The Manufacturing Sector. Yes, this structural problem of the Indian economy has been highlighted by many economists for many years, and all previous governments have taken some steps to boost manufacturing. The Make in India Initiative by the present government is a big step in this direction, towards making India, an investment hub for manufacturing.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Make In India?\nSectors covered under Make In India programme\nMake In India Initiative: What\u2019s new?\nIn Pipe-line\nWhy \u2018Make in India Initiative\u2019?\nVision: Zero Defect and Zero Effect\nAggressive branding and marketing\nHow to use the Make In India Portal for UPSC Exam preparation?\nWhat is Make In India?\n\nMake In India is a new national program designed to transform India into a global manufacturing hub.

The faster people are pulled out of poverty and brought into the middle class, the more opportunity will there be for global business. Therefore, investors from abroad need to create jobs. Cost effective manufacturing and a handsome buyer \u2013 one who has purchasing power \u2013 are both required. More employment means more purchasing power.\n\nVision: Zero Defect and Zero Effect\n\nIf each one of our millions of youngsters resolves to manufacture at least one such item, India can become a net exporter of goods. I, therefore, urge upon the youth, in particular our small entrepreneurs that they would never compromise, at least on two counts. First, zero defect and, second again zero effect. We should manufacture goods in such a way that they carry zero defect, that our exported goods are never returned to us. We should manufacture goods with zero effect that they should not have a negative impact on the environment.\n\nAggressive branding and marketing\n\nMany previous governments had taken different steps to attract foreign investment (FDI) to boost manufacturing. \u2018Make in India initiative\u2019 talks about nothing different, but this initiative involves better branding and marketing to gain investor confidence. The need to give stress on manufacturing and industries is made clear. An entrepreneurial culture is encouraged, with relaxation in policies. Make in India is surely a visionary move considering the low performance of our industries in the last 3-4 years.\n\nHow to use the Make In India Portal for UPSC Exam preparation?\n\nYes, UPSC aspirants and the general public interested to know the details of the Indian economy (particularly the manufacturing sector) got a really good website to do research upon.

It is observed worldwide that as income increases the share of the informal sector decreases and that of the formal SME sector increases.\n\nWorldwide Trends in the SME Sector\nJapan \u2013 SMEs employ 70% of the wage earners and contribute 55% of the value-added.\nThailand \u2013 SMEs employ 60.7% of the population while contributing 38% to the GDP.\nChina \u2013 SMEs contribute to over 68% of the exports \u2013 in the last 20 years created more SMEs than the total number of SMEs in Europe and the US combined.\n\nNote: In China, an industrial SME is defined as having up to 2,000 employees, while a small business has less than 300 employees and medium-sized business has employees between 301 and 2,000.\n\nWhat is the Importance and role of MSMEs in the Indian Economy?\n\nTo generate large scale employment\n\nIn India, capital is scarce and labour abundant. MSMEs are thought to have lower capital-output and capital-labour ratios than large-scale industries, and therefore, better serve growth and employment objectives. The MSME sector in India has grown significantly since 1960 \u2013 with an average annual growth rate of 4.4% in the number of units and 4.62% in employment (currently employing 30 million). Not only do MSMEs generate the highest employment per capita investment, but they also go a long way in checking rural-urban migration by providing people living in isolated areas with a sustainable source of employment.\n\nTo sustain economic growth and increase exports\n\nNon-traditional products account for more than 95% of the MSME exports (dominating in the export of sports goods, readymade garments, plastic products etc.). Since these products are mostly handcrafted and hence eco-friendly, there exists a tremendous potential to expand the quantum of MSME led exports. Also, MSMEs act as ancillary industries for Large Scale Industries providing them with raw materials, vital components and backward linkages e.g. large scale cycle manufacturers of Ludhiana rely heavily on the MSMEs of Malerkotla which produce cycle parts.\n\nMaking Growth Inclusive\n\nMSMEs are instruments of inclusive growth which touch upon the lives of the most vulnerable and marginalized. For many families, it is the only source of livelihood. Thus, instead of taking a welfare approach, this sector seeks to empower people to break the cycle of poverty and deprivation. It focuses on people\u2019s skills and agency. However, different segments of the MSME sector are dominated by different social groups.\n\nThe Twelfth Plan has listed the following as the objectives for the MSME sector\nPromoting competitiveness and productivity in the MSME space.\nMaking the MSME sector innovative, improving technology and depth.\nEnabling environment for the promotion and development of MSMEs.\nStrong presence in exports.\nImproved managerial processes in MSMEs.\nEvolution and Performance of the MSME Sector in India\nPre-Liberalization\nDuring the post-Independence period, small firms were expected to play an important role in the development process, especially in absorbing surplus labour and achieving an equitable income distribution. This is the traditional stylized role assigned to small industries.\nAt the beginning of the industrialization process, flexibility in production and the ability to offer differentiated products allow smaller firms to grow rapidly.\nLater, large-scale firms come to dominate the size distribution, making up a greater share of output, employment, and value-added because of scale economies, managerial efficiency, better access to finance and infrastructure, and a favourable tariff structure.\nPost-Liberalization\nThe growth rate of MSME, on an average, has declined considerably in terms of units and even employment but has improved marginally in terms of output and exports, in the post-liberalization period compared to the pre-liberalization period.\nThis could be probably due to \u2013 (a) With the threat of competition, new MSME units would not have come up as significant in the liberalization period as compared to the pre-liberalization period (b) The new MSME units that came up after liberalization may have been much more capital intensive than those that have come up in the past \u2013 with some proportions of the existing MSME units having modernized themselves to rely less on labour and also to take advantage of developments in the global market (c) Unable to face the competition some MSMEs exited the market, thereby affecting MSME employment and output initially.\nHowever, though it appears that the MSME growth performance (in terms of employment, output, and exports) might have suffered initially it has been able to recover impressively subsequently in the decade of 2000s.\nThe share of the registered MSMEs in India\u2019s GDP more than doubled during this period and its share in total organized sector employment increased to 34% during the same period. Although the share of registered MSME exports declined sharply initially, it bounced back to 12% in 2006-07.\nThe improved economic health of registered MSME sector is reflected in another parameter i.e. industrial sickness. Sickness in the registered MSME sector has declined both absolutely and relatively. This may be the outcome of improvements in management deficiencies, insufficient financial control, research and development, obsolete technology, inadequate demand, shortage of raw materials, infrastructure bottlenecks, etc.\nThere are two more issues concerning MSME performance:\nAncillarisation \u2013 the promotion of inter-firm linkages between large firms and MSME through subcontracting and ancillarisation in both public and private sectors has been an important dimension of India\u2019s MSME policy. Any growth of ancillarisation and sub-contracting would be advantageous to the MSME sector by way of assured marketing, covered technical assistance, finance, and supply of raw materials and training. During this period the percentage of ancillary units increased from 5 per cent. Note that however a significant proportion of MSME subcontracting and ancillarisation are informal in nature. The growing inter-firm linkages, formal as well as informal, would have benefited the economic performance of the MSME sector.\nThe degree of internationalization \u2013 the world over, an export strategy has been the primary foreign market entry mode adopted by MSMEs in their internationalization efforts \u2013 this has been observed in the Indian context as well. At the national level, several factors contributed to the increasing trend of MSME internationalization like \u2013 structural shift in the composition of MSME exports from traditional to non-traditional items, modes of entry such as MNCs and e-Commerce etc.\nPolicy Towards Small-Scale Industries\n\nThough MSMEs were recognised as important for employment generation and equitable distribution of income from the earliest days of Indian Independence, it appears that the objectives of policies stressing the role of MSMEs are not being realised.\nSince independence in 1947, especially since the late 1950s, development has been wide-ranging, both in terms of programs and regions. Policy measures included inter-alia fiscal concessions, subsidized and directed bank credit, and technical and marketing support, along with reservations of products for exclusive production by the MSME sector.\nThese policy measures were in tune with the other policies such as the domestic investment and foreign trade policies that became more restrictive over the years.\nSince the mid-1980s there has been a gradual turnaround in policy, including reforms in the tax system and liberalization of import policy.\nThe shift in MSME policy emphasis from protection to the promotion of competitiveness began with the introduction of an exclusive policy for MSME in 1991. Since then, the policy support in the 1990s and early 2000s has been large to enable the MSMEs to overcome key challenges to their performance and growth, namely, finance, technology, and marketing, among others.\nTo operate these programs and to monitor their progress, new agencies and institutions have been set up, and the existing ones strengthened at the national, regional, state, and lower levels. There is also a special bank for MSMEs \u2013 SIDBI. The SSIs have their own associations and are also represented in the national and state-level associations of large-scale industries.\nEvaluation of the Reservation Policy\nThe policy of reserving products for exclusive manufacture in the small-scale sector was started in 1967 with forty-seven items; the list of reserved items rose to 873 in 1984.\nThe number of items on the reserved list for the SSI sector was brought down to 836 by 1989.\nThe pace of reforms accelerated after 1991: average tariff rates have been steadily lowered, quantitative restrictions have been removed, and domestic investment policies have been liberalized.\nOver time, the number of items on the reserved list has also been reduced and stands at 605 in 2005.\nWith liberalization, since all the items on the reserved list can now be imported, MSMEs face competition from foreign enterprises even though large scale industries in India cannot produce these products.\nThe Censuses of the SSIs also suggest that the policy of reserving goods for production by SSIs has not been very effective. The number of units making reserved products was small compared to the overall size of the MSME sector, and the reserved products account for a small share of the total value of output in the MSME sector.\nAlso, it appears that the export performance of India may have suffered because of the reservation policy. Most growing economies witness a changing structure of exports, with high growth of exports of labour-intensive and resource-based industries. The export structure of India has not changed much in the last two decades, and this may be because many commodities in the potential high-growth category come under the reserved list.\nWhat are the challenges of MSME?\nMost of the unregistered MSMEs would predominantly comprise micro-enterprises, particularly confined to rural India, operating with obsolete technology, limited access to institutional finance etc. And there is a need to transform the huge unregistered MSME into registered MSME.\nNeed to improve the competitiveness of the overall MSME sector.\nAccess to technology.\nIPR related issues.\nDesign as a market driver.\nWasteful usage of resources/manpower.\nEnergy inefficiency and associated high cost.\nLow ICT usage.\nLow market penetration.\nQuality assurance/certification.\nStandardization of products and proper marketing channels to penetrate new markets.\nThe definition for MSMEs must be updated \u2013 considering inflation and availability of better technologies since the last change in 2006.\nRecent Initiatives\nAs part of the National Manufacturing Competitiveness Programme (NMCP) \u2013 10 specific initiatives were taken to enhance the competitiveness of the entire value chain of the MSME sector.\nLimited Liability Partnership (LLP) Act, 2008 was introduced to enable early corporatization of MSMEs and tap the capital market for fundraising. Accordingly, MSME platforms are created in BSE and NSE in 2012.\nTo develop a roadmap for the development and promotion of MSMEs, a task force was created by the Prime Minister of India in 2009. The Task Force, which comprised, among others, six specific theme-based sub-groups (on credit, marketing, infrastructure, technology, skill development, exit policy, labour, and taxation) submitted its report in 2010 suggesting: (1) Immediate policy measures (2) Medium-term institutional measures (3) Legal and regulatory structures to create a conducive environment for entrepreneurship and growth of MSMEs.\nThe Inter-Ministerial Committee for Accelerating Manufacturing in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises made recommendations on \u2013 (a) the promotion of start-ups (b) facilitating operation and growth (covering credit, technology, and marketing) (c) closure and exit (d) labour laws and regulations.\nThese policy initiatives are clear and consistent, aimed at transforming the ecosystem for the MSMEs sector by influencing: (1) Birth (encouraging Start-Ups) \u00a0(2) Operations and growth (by simplifying laws and regulations, and facilitating their access to credit. Better technology and dynamic markets, apart from skilled labour and reliable infrastructure) \u00a0(3) Orderly and easy exit\nThus, the emerging focus of India\u2019s MSME policy aims at covering the entire lifecycle of MSMEs to ensure a healthy, vibrant and competitive MSME sector.\nKey announcements of\u00a0Atma-nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan\nRs 3 lakh crore collateral-free automatic loans for MSMEs\nRs 50,000 crore equity infusion through MSME Fund of Funds\nRs 20 crore subordinate debt for MSMEs\nSummary\n\nMSME sector is the second largest employer after agriculture in India.

Lack of an insolvency and bankruptcy code had proved costly for the creditors (mainly banks) in many cases like the recent Kingfisher Airlines case. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code seeks to create a unified framework to resolve insolvency and bankruptcy in India.\n\nThe Code covers insolvency, liquidation, voluntary liquidation and bankruptcy.\u00a0The bill makes it easier for weak companies to exit or restructure their businesses. The code seeks to amend 11 laws, including the Companies Act, 2013 and the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003.\n\nLatest status:\u00a0The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016\u00a0was introduced in the Lok Sabha by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in December 2015 and the JPC\u2019s report is expected next week.\u00a0The new Code is based on the report of the committee which studied the matter (Bankruptcy Law Reform Committee).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Insolvency and Bankruptcy?\nWhy do we need such a code?\nCurrent insolvency mechanisms or laws (which obviously didn\u2019t work well!)\nInsolvency Proceedings: Companies vs Individuals\nCompanies and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP):\nIndividuals and Partnerships:\nDifferent parties associated with insolvency\nAdvantages of the New Code\nConcerns regarding the Bill:\nConclusion\nWhat are Insolvency and Bankruptcy?\n\nInsolvency is the situation where the debtor is not in a position to pay back the creditor. For a corporate firm, the signs of this could be a slow-down in sales, missing of payment deadlines etc. Bankruptcy is the legal declaration of Insolvency. So the former is a financial condition and latter is a legal position. All insolvencies need not lead to bankruptcy. The new code has a sequential procedure of Insolvency resolution, failing which, it leads to Bankruptcy (following liquidation of assets).\n\nWhy do we need such a code?\n\nSuch a unified code is essential because currently the issue is handled under at least 13 different laws. This code seeks to replace the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 and Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920. In addition, it seeks to amend 11 laws, including the Companies Act, 2013, Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 and Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003, among others.\nEarlier, if a company defaults, there were at least four different legal routes available to the debtors and creditors. This could lead to multiple negotiations, multiple penalties etc. for the debtor, compounding his plight.\nSuch parallel proceedings had also given rise to numerous instances of conflict between the laws. Four different agencies, the high courts, the Company Law Board, the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), and the Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) have overlapping jurisdiction, giving rise to the potential of systemic delays and complexities in the process. This new bill addresses these issues, by bringing in a new uniform Code.\nCurrent insolvency proceedings take months, if not years (average time: 4 years). This delay can acutely devalue the assets involved, thus making the insolvency negotiations redundant.\nThe current disposition involves the institution of official liquidator, which is prone to red-tapeism, chronic corruption, and nepotism. The new code seeks to keep the role of the adjudicator to the minimum.\nCurrently, only 25% of the asset value is recovered by the creditors even after the liquidation process.\nAll these compounded to the pitiable position our Public Sector Banks find themselves in. Rising NPAs and mounting Stressed Assets have also eroded their profits, as the recent SBI reports point out. The easing of liquidation process can help the banks recover a lot of bad debts.\nIndia fares poorly in the Ease of Doing Business index of World Bank. Easiness of Exit is an important parameter in this index. The present morass of laws doesn\u2019t help in easing the exit of trouble-prone entities.\nAccording to World Bank data, it takes more than four years to wind up an ailing company in India, almost twice as long as it does in China.\nJust like the US Bankruptcy Code that provides for fairly quick liquidation or reorganisation of business, India too need a new code which will prevent the economy from tumbling southwards.\nCurrent insolvency mechanisms or laws (which obviously didn\u2019t work well!)\nSecuritization and Enforcement of Security.\nCorporate Debt Restructuring or CDR.\nSick Industrial Companies Act or SICA\nInsolvency Proceedings: Companies vs Individuals\n\nThe code will apply to all sort of business entities including corporate companies, partnerships, limited liability partnerships, individuals etc. Broadly the insolvency proceedings or the Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP) can be classified into two streams:\n\nCompanies and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP):\n\nThe process can be initiated either by the debtor or the creditor(s). In this case, of companies and LLPs, the resolution process has to be completed in 180 days from the date of registration of the intent. That means once an application for insolvency resolution is accepted, an 180-day moratorium comes into place, during which no claims can be pursued against the debtor or its assets. This period of 180 days, can be extended by another 90 days if 75% of the financial creditors agree. The process enables the debtor and creditor to hold negotiations and finalise a draft resolution plan. The draft plan is to be agreed up on by a majority of the creditors. If they do agree, the plan is finalised and submitted to the adjudicating authority, which in this case is the National Company Law Tribunal. If the plan is not agreed up on by the majority of creditors, the company goes into liquidation.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThere will be a provision for hastening up the IRP, as far as companies with smaller operations are concerned. Here the process will have to be completed within 90 days, which may be extended only if 75% of the financial creditors agree to it.\n\nIndividuals and Partnerships:\n\nHere, there are steps to be followed even before the Insolvency Resolution Process, IRP starts. Before going for IRP, the debtor may apply for forgiveness of specified amount of debt, provided his total assets are below a limit set by the Central Govt. This initial pardoning has to be done within 6 months. After that, the formal IRP starts, just like the first stream of companies, mentioned above. The negotiations between the debtor and creditor will be supervised by an insolvency professional. If they negotiations succeed, the repayment plan is drafted. If the plan is agreed upon by the majority of the creditors, the plan is submitted to the adjudicator, which in this case is Debt Recovery Tribunal. If they fail, the matter will proceed to the bankruptcy resolution.\n\nDifferent parties associated with insolvency\n\nNow that we have dealt with the insolvency process, we shall move on to the different parties involved.\n\nInsolvency professionals and agencies: as said earlier, the IRP will be managed and supervised by a licensed professional. The Insolvency Code also proposes to set up insolvency professional agencies, which can recruit the professionals and regulate them. The professionals will also have the power and duty to control the assets of the debtor during the process.\nInformation Utilities: The code also proposes to establish information utilities which will maintain a range of financial information about firms. Their duty is to collect and disseminate the information to facilitate the insolvency resolution process.\nInsolvency Regulator: The Code establishes the insolvency regulator, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, IBBI, which will have the mandate to oversee the insolvency resolution in the country. The Board will have a membership of 10 members, including those representing the Central Government & Reserve Bank of India. The board will also act as the apex regulator, registering and regulating the information utilities, insolvency professional agencies, insolvency professionals etc.\nInsolvency and Bankruptcy Fund, IBF: deposits of the fund will include grants made by the central government, the amount deposited by the persons, interest earned on investments made from the fund etc. any person, who has contributed to the fund, may apply for withdrawal, in a case of proceedings against him.\nBankruptcy and Insolvency Adjudicators: as noted earlier, there are two different adjudicators, proposed by the code, one each for the two streams for individuals and companies. The National Company Law Tribunal will have the jurisdiction over companies and Limited Liability Partnerships, whereas the Debt Recovery Tribunal will have the jurisdiction over the individuals and partnership firms. Appeals against the orders of these tribunals may be challenged before their respective Appellate Tribunals, and further before the Supreme Court.\nCredit Committee: it is to be composed of financial creditors. The primary aim of the committee is to ensure payments to operating creditors on a pre-scheduled priority order (the priority proposed is listed later in the article).\nOffences and Penalties: the offences committed by the debtor under the corporate insolvency (first stream) like concealing the property, defrauding creditors etc. will be punished with imprisonment up to 5 years, with a fine of up to one crore rupees. Whereas, the offences committed by an individual (second stream), like providing false information, the imprisonment will vary based on the evidence. For most of these offences, the fine will not exceed five lakh rupees.\nAdvantages of the New Code\n\nThe bill seeks to shift from revival/recovery to resolution. This will ensure maximum assets recovered from the debtor, thus helping the balance sheets of the creditor. This would go a long way in helping the NPA-situation of the banks.\nThe new bill proposes to speed up both recoveries and restructuring procedures. There is significant a curb on the time involved, a maximum of 270 days. This will expedite the insolvency process. Time is important as the value of the assets corrodes very rapidly, when the firm is precariously placed.\nThe bill aims at promoting investments, freeing up banks\u2019 resources for other productive uses, boosting credit markets and improving ease of doing business in India, thus making a cumulative positive impact on the economy\nThe fixed time-period and predictable procedural methods will encourage creditors to join the collective insolvency resolution, rather than initiate individual actions.\nBy keeping the role of the adjudicator to a minimum, the bill ensures that delays arising from the bottlenecks in court proceedings are also reduced to the minimum. The principal business decisions such as the economic viability of the debtor, will be determined through negotiations between the debtor and creditors \u2013 an exercise that will be facilitated by insolvency professionals. The role of the NCLT is primarily to ensure that the procedures are complied with and no illegality or fraud has taken place.\nThe draft Bill also abolishes the institution of the official liquidator, which by all accounts has been a failure in non-viable businesses. Instead, the functions of the official liquidator are to be performed by insolvency professionals.\nIndustry anticipates that the change will provide an easy exit option for insolvent and sick firms.\nThe new code will matter to private sector employees too. The Bill, by forcing failed firms to shut shop, can lead to a survival of the fittest in the job market too.\nMake it easy for the budding entrepreneurs to start or exit from the start-up business. Commerce and Industry minister says it is going to make it easy to start up as much as to get out of the start-ups because if they are not doing well, there shouldn\u2019t be a taboo. They would be able to get out faster, thus helping the Start-up India Stand-up India campaign.\nConcerns regarding the Bill:\nThe draft Bill needs careful review, particularly on how the new law would interact with existing laws in this space, including the Sarfaesi Act and other debt recovery laws. Since it appears that the new Code doesn\u2019t replace the existing laws (and only amends 11 laws), there must at least be a clear demarcation of when these laws would apply and of overriding provisions in cases of conflict with the code, if we are to avoid reverting to the old regime of chaos and uncertainty.\nThe bill also provides for priority with regard to the distribution of proceeds following liquidation of the company (who gets the bounty first!). In the order of priority, the first charge will be insolvency resolution process cost and liquidation costs to be paid in full. Liquidation proceeds will then be used to clear debts owed to secured creditors, and then to pay workmen\u2019s dues for 12 months, unpaid dues to employees other than workmen, and financial dues owed to unsecured creditors, in that order. Government taxes for two years, other debts, preference shareholders and equity shareholders will receive last priority for payment (waterfall provision). Since equity shareholders could include the employees\u2019 PF, pensioners\u2019 fund etc., giving the public money the least importance has raised some eye brows.\nThe credit committee is to compose only of financial creditors. However, operation creditors is to be paid out first. This could lead to a conflict of interest.\nOnly two year history is to be checked for diversion, to check for ascertaining malfeasance. There is a suggestion that earlier history also should be taken into account.\nThe proposed Bill is also quite ambitious in the creation of a new institutional architecture to deal with insolvency. Among other things, it proposes the establishment of a new regulator, the creation of a new profession of insolvency professionals and the establishment of institutions known as information utilities that are designed to provide accurate information on defaults. These institutions and practices will take time to establish and there need to be well thought out transitional arrangements in the interim. Equally essential is significant training for insolvency professionals and judges if insolvency resolution and liquidation are to be the efficient and time-bound processes that the draft Bill envisages.\nPromoters will have the option to buy-back the company at a certain price, with certain debt restructuring. This has to be contemplated further to avoid bankruptcy tool from becoming an instrument to be exploited to reduce debt and increase equity value.\nThere is also apprehension that the ease of exit, could lead to hire and fire, especially in the private firms and start-up companies.\nConclusion\n\nThe proposed Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill is only a starting point for easing exits for debtors in distress, preserving value and providing creditors with greater certainty in outcomes. Yet, by providing for a linear, time-bound and collective process for insolvency resolution and liquidation, it is a step in the right direction.\n\nArticle by: Jishnu J Raju",

    "[CONTENT] #537": "Projects like Smart Cities, Dedicated Freight Corridors, High-speed railways etc require huge, long-term investment. From where does this money come from? Government of India had announced setting up of National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) in 2015 budget.\u00a0The fund was eventually set up in December 2015.\u00a0The Fund aims to attract investment from both domestic and international sources.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIssues with infrastructure sector\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF)\nNIIF as fund of funds\nHow does this work?\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF): What will it do?\nNIIF working in a nutshell:\nNIIF: Objectives\nFunctions of NIIF\nNIIF: Operational Aspects\nNIIF: Governance\nConclusion:\nIssues with infrastructure sector\n\nThe sector needs long term finance; but banks are helpless: One of the fundamental reason why Indian infrastructure is still not up to desired level is the lack of long term finance. This is despite the fact that 10.4% of bank lending was channelled to Infrastructure in 2015.\nBut of late, the banks in India especially the public sector banks are reeling under the pressure of Non-Performing Assets and Stressed assets, combing around 4.5% and 11% respectively.\nThis has forced the banks to confine themselves to a shell and not commit themselves to long term financing portfolios and projects with long gestation periods.\nIt is in light of this fund crunch situation that the Government of India announced setting up of National Investment and Infrastructure Fund in 2015 budget.\nThe NIIF through its pass-throughs, such as the National Housing Bank and the IRFC, will fund for a longer window of 20 years or more.\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF)\nTo make it simple, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) is a fund created by the Government of India for enhancing infrastructure financing in the country.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has already approved NIIF as an alternate investment fund.\nThe National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) Limited has been incorporated as a company under the Companies Act, 2013, duly authorized to act as investment manager of National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.\nThe government will invest Rs 20,000 crore into the NIIF from the Budget, with another Rs 20,000 crore expected to come from private investors.\nThe government\u2019s share of the NIIF\u2019s corpus is envisaged to be under 50%.\nWill NIIF invest in stalled projects? Answer: Yes\nWill NIIF invest in brownfield projects? Answer: Yes, both greenfield and brownfield, if it\u2019s commercially viable.\n\nNote:\u00a0You should not confuse National Investment Fund (NIF) and\u00a0National Innovation Foundation (NIF) with\u00a0National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF). All three are different concepts.\n\nNIIF as fund of funds\nNIIF is a fund of funds.\u00a0So there will be multiple alternate investment funds underneath.\nThere could be a stressed-assets fund, renewable energy fund, brownfield projects fund \u2013 sponsored by the NIIF.\nHow does this work?\nWith the corpus of Rs 40K crore the Trust would be able to raise debt.\nNIIF would raise funds upto 10 times the corpus\u00a0or up to Rs 2 lakh crore on a long-term basis.\nIt can invest in equity through infrastructure finance companies such as IRFC(Indian Railway Finance Corporation) and NHB(National Housing Bank).\nThe infrastructure finance companies can then leverage this extra equity, manifold.\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF): What will it do?\nEquity (capital) to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)/Financial Institutions (FIs) that are engaged mainly in infrastructure financing. These institutions will be able to leverage this equity support and provide debt to the projects selected.\nInvest in funds engaged mainly in infrastructure sectors and managed by Asset Management Companies (AMCs) for equity / quasi-equity funding of listed / unlisted companies.\nProvides fund directly to commercially projects, both Greenfield and brownfield, including stalled projects. A government official said some key transportation projects could be taken up initially by the NIIF for funding.\nGreenfield: a Greenfield project is one that lacks constraints imposed by prior work. Simply means: a new project.\nBrownfield: it is a term used to describe a land previously used for industrial purposes or some other uses. Brownfield project simply means: an already existing/ stalled project.\nNIIF working in a nutshell:\n\nThe fund is to be set up as a Trust. It is registered with SEBI as Category II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) on December 28, 2015. (Read ahead on different categories of AIF)\nNIIF would raise funds by issuing offshore credit enhanced bonds and also tap into anchor investors.\nAnchor investors or cornerstone investors are marque institutional investors like sovereign wealth fund, mutual fund etc.\nSovereign wealth fund: a state owned fund.\nThe fund thus developed will be used to finance Indian infrastructure financing companies like the IRFC (Indian Rail Finance Corporation), NHB (National Housing Board) etc.\nThe fund thus received by these companies is then channelled to their respective niche areas (railways and Housing respectively in this case), thus increasing the investment into these sectors manifold.\nThus fundamentally NIIF is a Banker (NIIF) of the Banker (e.g.: NHB) of the Banker (e.g.: Housing loans).\nNIIF: Objectives\nMaximize economic impact of each Rupee spent.\nMainly through infrastructure development in commercially viable projects, both Greenfield and brownfield, including stalled projects.\nIt could also consider other nationally important projects, for example, in manufacturing, if commercially viable.\nFunctions of NIIF\nFund raising through suitable instruments including off-shore credit enhanced bonds, and attracting anchor investors to participate as partners in NIIF;\nServicing of the investors of NIIF.\nConsidering and approving candidate companies/institutions/ projects (including state entities) for investments and periodic monitoring of investments.\nInvesting in the corpus created by Asset Management Companies (AMCs) for investing in private equity.\nPreparing a shelf of infrastructure projects and providing advisory services.\nNIIF: Operational Aspects\nNIIF is not a single entity. There can be more than one fund. There could be a stressed-assets fund, renewable energy fund, brownfield projects fund, all sponsored by the NIIF.\nThus NIIF will be established as one or more Alternative Investment funds (AIF)\u00a0under the SEBI Regulations.\nAlternative Investment funds (AIF): AIF as an investment vehicle was established to pool in funds for investing in real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Till now, in India, pooling of capital was allowed only for Indian investors, and investment was done according to a pre-determined policy. However, selectively approval route for investment was used by overseas investors and non-resident Indians (NRIs). AIFs are primarily aimed at high net worth individuals, and according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012, the minimum investment from an individual is\u00a0Rs.1 crore. The overall corpus of the AIF should be at least\u00a0Rs.20 crore and there should not be more than 1,000 investors at any point in time. Also, the fund manager or promoter should have contributed at least 2.5% or\u00a0Rs.5 crore, whichever is less, to the initial capital.\nThere are three categories of AIFs depending upon on their effect on the economy.\nCategory-I AIFs have a positive spillover on the economy and may get concessions from the regulator or the government. These include venture funds, social venture funds and infrastructure funds, among others.\nCategory-II includes private equity funds and debt funds and do not get any concessions. These cannot raise debt for investment purposes, but can do so to meet their day-to-day operational requirements.\nCategory-III includes hedge funds, and are usually traded to make short-term returns.\nIf set up as Category I and II AIFs, then NIIF will be eligible for a pass through status under the Income Tax Act.\nA \u2018pass-through\u2019 status means that the income generated by the fund would be taxed in the hands of the ultimate investor, and the fund itself would not have to pay tax on the same.\nIn the case of category III AIF, where pass through status is not available, all income received by NIIF will be taxable at its level and any distribution made to the unit holders (investors) would be tax exempt.\nNIIF was formed as a category II AIF as a Trust under Indian Trust Act on 28 December 2015 along with the formation of\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund Trustee Ltd. (IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd as Advisor to NIIF Trustee Ltd for one year initially)and\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund Ltd. India (Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL) was appointed as Investment Advisor to NIIF Ltd for 6 months initially.)\nThe government will invest Rs 20,000 crore into the NIIF from the Budget, with another Rs 20,000 crore expected to come from private investors.\nGovernment\u2019s contribution/share in the corpus will be 49% in each entity set up as an alternate Investment Fund (AIF) and will neither be increased beyond, nor allowed to fall below, 49%. The whole of 49% would be contributed by Government directly. Rest is open for contribution from others.\nThe contribution of Government of India to NIIF would enable it to be seen virtually as a sovereign fund and is expected to attract overseas sovereign/ quasi-sovereign/multilateral/bilateral investors to co-invest in it.\nCash-rich Central Public Sector Enterprises (PSUs) could contribute to the Fund, which would be over and above the Government\u2019s 49%.\nSimilarly, domestic pension and provident funds and National Small Savings Fund may also provide funds to the NIIF.\nNIIF may also utilize the proceeds of monetized land and other assets of PSUs for infrastructure development.\nThe NIIF will work out these details in consultation with the Ministry of Finance, to match different investors\u2019 preferences.\nExample of non-governmental funding:\nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) Ltd. signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with RUSNANO of Russia on 2 February 2016 to set up the Russia-India High Technology Private Equity Fund for joint implementation of investments into projects in India. RUSNANO is a Russian development institute with interest to invest in projects in the field of high technologies and defence including the projects aimed at establishment of manufacturing industrial enterprises in India.\nInternational pension funds and sovereign wealth funds from countries such as Russia, Singapore have evinced interest in participating in India\u2019s Rs 40,000-crore National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF)\nThe Union Cabinet gave its ex-post facto approval for a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to mobilise up to $75 billion long-term investment in the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF).\nNIIF: Governance\nThere will be a Governing Council of the NIIF which will have Government representatives and experts in international finance, eminent economists and infrastructure professionals. It could include representatives from other non-Government shareholders.\nThe terms and period of appointment of the Governing Council of the NIIF will be as decided by the Government.\nThe Governing Council will oversee the activities of the Trust and will be constituted as a separate legal entity, if necessary.\nGoverning council headed is currently by Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley and its other members include the secretaries of economic affairs and financial services, SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya, former Infosys executive TV Mohandas Pai and Hemendra Kothari.\nNIIF would be supported by one or more Chief Executive Officers (depending upon the number of funds created) and a small investment team consisting of limited number of expert staff, at arm\u2019s length from the Government.\nTheir salaries would be market-linked.\nIt would be possible for the NIIF Governing Council to appoint one or several Fund Managers.\nNIIF would have full autonomy for project selection.\nNIIF would formulate guidelines and would follow due processes for selection criteria for AMCs and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) / Financial Institutions (FIs).\nConclusion:\n\nNow that government has revitalized the financing arm of the infrastructure sector, it must now train its eyes on other obstacles which include an outdated labour law regime, massive dearth of skilled labour, problems in land acquisition, environment and other clearances etc. to achieve the cherished dream of transforming India as the manufacturing hub of the world through the Make in India Project.\n\nArticle by: Jishnu J Raju\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)",

Every Department will now have visibility of each other\u2019s activities providing critical data while planning & comprehensively executing projects.\nPrioritization: Through this, different Departments will be able to prioritize their projects through cross-sectoral interactions.\nOptimization: The National Master Plan will assist different ministries in planning for projects after the identification of critical gaps. For the transportation of the goods from one place to another, the plan will help in selecting the most optimum route in terms of time and cost.\nSynchronization: Individual Ministries and Departments often work in silos. There is a lack of coordination in the planning and implementation of the project resulting in delays. It will help in synchronizing the activities of each department, as well as of different layers of governance, holistically by ensuring coordination of work between them.\nAnalytical: The plan will provide the entire data at one place with GIS-based spatial planning and analytical tools having 200+ layers, enabling better visibility to the executing agency.\nDynamic: All Ministries and Departments will now be able to visualize, review and monitor the progress of cross-sectoral projects, through the GIS platform, as the satellite imagery will give on-ground progress periodically and the progress of the projects will be updated regularly on the portal. It will help in identifying the vital interventions for enhancing and updating the master plan.\nWhat is the need for the scheme?\nTo address the wide gap between macro planning and micro implementation due to the lack of coordination and advanced information sharing as departments think and work in silos.\nAs per reports, studies estimate the logistics costs in India at about 13-14% of GDP as against about 7-8% in developed economies. With this high logistical cost, the competitiveness of India\u2019s exports is greatly reduced.\nIt will increase economic activities and create employment on a large scale due to the creation of quality infrastructure for sustainable development.\nThe scheme is in synergy with the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) which was announced to provide a clear framework for monetization and give potential investors a ready list of assets to generate investor interest.\nA holistic and integrated transport connectivity strategy will greatly support\u00a0\u2018Make in India\u2019 and integrate different modes of transport.\nAnother push for such a scheme was the lack of demand in the post-Covid-19 scenario, which in turn led to a lack of private demand and investment demand.\nDue to land acquisition delays and litigation issues, the rate of implementation of projects is very slow on global standards- issues that the scheme will address.\nWay forward\n\nPM Gati Shakti scheme is a move in the right direction, but it needs to address structural and macroeconomic stability concerns arising from high public expenditure.\n\nThus, this initiative must be supported by a stable and predictable regulatory and institutional framework.",

In pursuance of this, an annual infrastructure pipeline would be developed.\n\nTo achieve this task, a Task Force under the chairmanship of Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs has been constituted by Union Finance Minister to draw up a National Infrastructure Pipeline for each of the years from FY 2019-20 to FY 2024-25.\n\nThe Task Force is chaired by\u00a0Secretary, DEA with CEO (NITI Aayog), Secretary (Expenditure), Secretary of the Administrative Ministries, and Additional Secretary (Investments), DEA as members and Joint Secretary (IPF), DEA as Member Secretary.\n\nThe first meeting of the Task Force was held in September 2019. This exercise is expected to be followed up by a periodical review process.\n\nNIP will enable a forward outlook on infrastructure projects which will create jobs, improve ease of living, and provide equitable access to infrastructure for all, thereby making growth more inclusive.\n\nNational Infrastructure Pipeline: Major Expenditure to be on Energy and Roads\n\nDuring the fiscals 2020 to 2025, sectors such as Energy (24%), Roads (19%), Urban (16%), and Railways (13%) amount to around 70% of the projected capital expenditure in infrastructure in India.\n\nMinistry/ Department\tFY 20-25\nEnergy\nPower\t1175995\nRenewable Energy\t929500\nAtomic Energy\t154088\nPetroleum and Natural Gas\t194666\nTotal Energy\t24,54,249\nRoads\nRoads\t19,63,943\nTotal Roads\t19,63,943\nRailways\nRailways\t13,68,523\nTotal Railways\t13,68,523\nPorts\nPorts\t1,00,923\nTotal Ports\t1,00,923\nAirports\nAirports\t1,43,398\nTotal Airports\t1,43,398\nUrban\nAMRUT, SMART Cities, MRTS, Affordable Housing, Jal Jeevan Mission\t16,29,012\nTotal Urban\t16,29,012\nTelecommunication\nTelecommunication\t3,20,498\nTotal Telecommunications\t3,20,498\nIrrigation\nIrrigation\t7,72,678\nTotal Irrigation\t7,72,678\nRural Infrastructure\nRural Infrastructure\t4,10,955\nWater and Sanitation\t3,61,810\nTotal Rural Infrastructure\t7,72,765\nAgriculture and Food Processing Infrastructure\nAgriculture Infrastructure\t54,298\nFood Processing Industries\t1,255\nFood and Public Distribution\t5,000\nTotal Agriculture and Food Processing Infrastructure\t60,553\nSocial Infrastructure\nHigher Education\t1,18,348\nSchool Education\t37,791\nHealth and Family Welfare\t1,68,622\nSports\t7,618\nTourism\t24,321\nTotal Social Infrastructure\t3,56,701\nIndustrial Infrastructure\nIndustries and Internal Trade\t2,99,237\nSteel\t8,225\nTotal Industrial Infrastructure\t3,07,462\nTOTAL (Rs. Crore)\t1,02,50,704\n\nOut of the total expected capital expenditure of Rs. 102 lakh crore, projects worth Rs 42.7 lakh crore (42%) are under implementation, projects worth Rs 32.7 lakh crore (32%) are in conceptualization stage and rest are under development.\n\nThe funding of the National Infrastructure Pipeline will be jointly made by the Centre, states and the private sector in the proportion of 39:39:22 (39 % each by the centre and states and 22% by the private sector).\n\nIt is expected that projects of certain states, who are yet to communicate their pipelines, would be added to the pipeline in due course.\n\nThe goal of $5 Trillion Economy by 2024: Is this realistic?\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi had declared that he wanted India to be a \u201c$5 trillion economy\u201d by 2024 when he once again faces reelection. This would, he said, be \u201cchallenging, but achievable.\u201d\n\nIn the 2019 Independence Day speech made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a key announcement was the investment of Rs. 100 lakh crore in infrastructure over the next five years.\n\nHowever, to reach the $5 trillion mark by 2024, Indian Economy should grow over 12% a year from 2019 (nominal growth in dollar terms). As of 2019-20, the nominal growth of India (which includes the inflation factor), is estimated at only around 9%. The real growth as of 2019-20, is only around 5%.\n\nIf the real GDP growth of India rises to 8% and the average inflation rate stabilizes around 4%, a nominal growth of 12 per cent may be the end result. This makes the dream of a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024 possible.\n\nHowever, as the target is in terms of the dollar, there are two major variables which can impact India\u2019s growth towards achieving this target:\n\nInflation rate\nRupee-dollar exchange rate\n\nAs the 5 trillion dollar target of GDP is calculated at current prices (which includes inflation), one may feel that India may achieve the target GDP, not because of increase in production (output) but due to the higher inflation rate. However, this may not be the case. With an increase in inflation, there will be a decline in the purchasing power of money. This may reduce consumption and thus may negatively impact GDP growth.\n\nOn the exchange-rate aspect, if the rupee depreciates further, it will adversely affect India\u2019s GDP growth in dollar terms. If rupee starts appreciating against the dollar, it makes it easier to reach the target.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) is a crucial initiative by the Indian government to boost the country\u2019s infrastructure development. With an estimated investment of Rs. 111 lakh crore, the NIP covers a wide range of sectors including energy, transportation, water and sanitation, social infrastructure, and others.\n\nThe pipeline aims to provide a major impetus to the country\u2019s economic growth, create job opportunities, and improve the quality of life of the citizens.",

The Japanese Yen is projected to appreciate against the Indian Rupee over the period questioning the viability of the loan and the project on the whole.\nWhat are the Pros of the project?\nConvenience:\nHaving an alternative mode of transport will decongest the roads.\nAlso, the speed of bullet trains will save the time and boost the businesses in large cities where time is money.\nThe interconnectedness between the towns and cities would reduce the hassle of commuting thereby helping in reducing the migration.\nSafety:\nSafety has been one of the major concerns of Indian Railways.\nThe record of bullet trains in the field of safety has been impeccable.\nThe Shinkansen trains of Japan started in 1964 report no fatalities till date.\n\u00a0Environment-friendly:\nIn today\u2019s global environmental scenario, any step which checks the pollution is welcome.\nThe emissions of CO2 per passenger km from speed rails is way less compared to that of automobiles and aeroplanes. It emits an eighth and a fifth of emissions respectively.\nEconomic growth:\nIt will help in the infrastructure development thereby spurring the economic growth and creating huge employment opportunities.\nWhat are the Cons of the project?\nCosts:\nThe Mumbai- Ahmedabad high-speed rail costs around one lakh crore Indian Rupee.\nConsidering the cost overruns due to delays and future fluctuations of inflation, it may further get increased.\nHigh fares:\nIt is estimated that the fares may range in between Rs. 4000 to Rs 5000\u00a0to make the running of trains economically viable.\nSuch fares would be affordable only by the rich who might prefer air travel considering the lesser margin of fares between them.\nHowever, most of the travel by trains in India is done by the poorer sections.\nLand acquisition:\nIt might act as another obstacle delaying the project and also causing large-scale displacement of people.\nWhat are the arguments against Bullet Trains in India?\nThe Indian Railways is in a worrying state.There is a need to strengthen the present infrastructure of the railways.\nThe recent number of increasing rail accidents and the Elphinstone road station stampede further strengthens this case.\nThe recent report by the Standing committee on Railways headed by Sudip Bandopadhyay said that in 2014-15, about 40% of the accidents occurred at Unmanned Level Crossings and in 2015-16, about 28%.\nThe committee also recommended a complete shift to LHB coaches to minimize the loss of lives in case of derailments.\n\nThus, the argument is, instead of strengthening and upgrading the current infrastructure keeping in mind the safety of millions of passengers, why invest in a project catered to the well-off sections.\n\nIs this argument valid?\n\nThere is no denying the fact that safety considerations are to be kept in mind and accorded high priority.\n\nHowever, comparing these two investments in not right.\n\nThese should not be considered as alternative choices. Investments should be made for renovation and up gradation as well as in the bullet trains project.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia aspires to become the third largest economy in the next 25 years. It has already proven its prowess in the field of space and now is the time for furthering its international stature by joining the exclusive club of nations having a high-speed rail network.\n\nEverything will have its array of pros and cons. It lies in ones\u2019 wisdom to weigh them equally and choose the path. The technological development comes at a cost but the safety of our citizens should not be a value added.\n\nArticle by: Pullela Ujwala",

It was administered by the Ministry of Civil Aviation.\nAir India merged with the erstwhile Indian Airlines in 2007 based on the recommendations of Justice Dharmadhikari\u2019s committee report.\nAs part of the merger process, a new company called the National Aviation Company of India Limited (now called Air India Limited) was established, into which both Air India and Indian Airlines would be merged.\nAir India-Indian Airlines Merger: A failed one?\n\nAI and Indian Airlines had been running profitably till 2005\u201306. However, their future had already been compromised by then. It is commented that the merger of Air India with Indian Airlines has created woes due to a lack of effective leadership and erroneous government policies.\n\nAlso read: Disinvestment in India\n\nWhy were Indian Airlines merged with Air India (2007)?\nThe merger was initiated with the aim of making profits and gaining a high market share for the airline. The major objective behind the committee formation was a rationalization of operations and restructuring of debt.\nEscalating costs of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF).\nImmense competition from private and low-cost airlines.\nIncreased cost pressures due to the acquisition of additional aircraft Leadership crisis due to frequent changes of the chairman- cum-managing director.\nAir India could not fully use the bilateral rights, unlike foreign airlines which took maximum advantage. So it was decided to go for the merger.\nDeclining passenger traffic in the premium class.\n\nAlso read: Privatisation of Air India \u2013 Should India\u2019s Public Sector Airline be Disinvested?\n\nWhy was the Air India-Indian Airlines merge not successful?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAir India has had four chairmen in the last six years with no one\u00a0biting the bullet on tough decisions. The instability at the top has led to poor profits due to a lack of decision-making.\nThe merger brought together two disparate entities and created\u00a0a behemoth with 30,517 employees \u2013 221 employees per aircraft, which is much higher than Singapore Airlines which has 161, and British Airways which has 178. The increase in the number of employees led to pressure in the form of salaries and this further led to more losses. (Reference: Business Today)\nNo attempts were made to standardize hiring policies for the rank and file. Both the partners had different rules and policies which were not harmonized for a smoother run.\nDuring the period 1998\u20132004, no new planes were ordered for AI or Indian Airlines.\nBecause of post-merger HR issues like compensation, career progression, salary payment, promotion issues, and employee strikes, the merger did not yield the intended objectives.\nThe poor management practices and improper planning have pushed the merged entity into trouble.\nThe Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, tourism, and Culture, in 2010 summarized the problems of the Air India merger process. It said that the first reason for the fall in the morale of the employees was changing the name of IA (Indian Airlines) which had had a good reputation in the market. The reason was not revealed either to customers or to employees by the management.\n10-year Restructuring Plan for Air India (2012-2022)\nIn April 2012, the government signed a 10-year restructuring plan with the AI.\nBy April 2012, when the government finally signed a turnaround plan for AI, the annual operational loss of the airline had increased to around \u20b95,000 crore and its accumulated debt had reached nearly \u20b943,500 crore. It was then operating on a capital base of \u20b93,345 crore (AI 2012).\nRepeated statements by the MCA in Parliament over the years have testified that the government is largely satisfied that the AI is progressing as per the turnaround plan (MCA 2017a).\nIs Air India a loss-making company?\n\nThe national carrier is one among other airlines that were struggling and is still undergoing a 10-year rehabilitation package that started in 2012.\n\nIt posted faster-than-anticipated operating profits and lower net losses in 2015\u201316, much before its recovery package was to begin bearing fruit, while its low-cost subsidiary Air India Express posted profits.\n\nBoth have reportedly done even better in 2016\u201317.\n\nAir India\u2019s passenger load factor (or its ability to fill seat capacity), a key indicator of airline performance, has improved steadily over the last five years.\n\nThe Indian civil aviation sector at large also reported positive results the same year, after a decade of difficulty.\n\nWith steady passenger growth, it is expected to be the third-largest civil aviation market by the end of the decade. (Reference: EPW)\n\nAlso read: Make In India Initiative\n\nHow correct is it to point fingers at the management of Air India for losses?\n\nAir India is not the only airline that was doing badly earlier.\n\nPrivate airlines too have had difficulty navigating India\u2019s civil aviation sector.\n\nAround 23 airlines closed or merged with others but the latter eventually shut down or ceased operations.\n\nMany of the airlines that continued to operate have reported losses over the past decade.\n\nUntil the drop in global crude oil prices, the sector faced difficulties due to relatively higher aviation turbine fuel costs in India, excess capacity, and a limited number of high-traffic routes to vie for.\n\nCriticisms of Privatising Air India\nThe civil aviation market in India, like in many parts of the world, is oligopolistic, with a few firms controlling large market shares.\nForcing the exit or merger of an established state-run airline \u2013 with the third largest market share which has 31% of the planes in the sector and prime slots at airports worldwide \u2013 will only aid in the undesirable concentration of market power with a few already large private airlines, and will prove anti-competitive.\nIf anything, a public sector enterprise of this size in an oligopolistic sector is not only desirable but essential.\nWay ahead\n\nInstead of indulging in virulent criticism of the Maharaja, the government must allow the recovery package to bear fruit, and must not privatize in haste. All signals \u2013 fuel prices and market conditions -suggest that Air India will prove to be a profitable venture for the government like it used to be earlier.\n\nAir India will have to cut layers of management, align staff by role, bring in lateral hires, overhaul customer-facing functions, and implement a massive training exercise. And, rein in pilots and engineers, even if it means a partial lockout. Though the process is on track to some extent, still a lot needs to be done in this regard.\n\nArticle contributed by Pooja Chaudhary and edited by ClearIAS Team",

Promotion of Electric vehicles: \u2013 National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP)\nConclusion\nInitiatives to Promote Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency\n\nIn this article, we discuss a few initiatives for Energy Efficiency and Energy conservation taken by the Government of India through the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), Ministry of Power.\n\n1. Standards and Labeling by the\u00a0Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE)\n\nThe Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) initiated the Standards & Labeling program for equipment and appliances in 2006 to provide the consumer with an informed choice about energy saving.\n\nThe energy efficiency labeling programs under BEE are intended to reduce the energy consumption of appliance without diminishing the services it provides to consumers.\n\n\u2018Star Rating\u2019 mobile app\n\nThis app is linked to the Standards and Labeling database. It provides the user with a platform to compare personalized energy-saving devices across the same class and get real-time feedback from consumers so that they can make an informed purchase decision. Apart from being a one-stop solution for customers, it\u2019s also a valuable tool for policymakers to access the accumulated data and analyze the feedback of the market at any given point in time.\n\n2. Energy Conservation Building Codes (ECBC) by the Ministry of Power\n\nThe Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) was launched by the Ministry of Power for new commercial buildings in 2007. It sets minimum energy standards for new commercial buildings.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTo promote a market pull for energy-efficient buildings, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency developed a voluntary Star Rating Programme for buildings which is based on the actual performance of a building.\n\nThe updated version of ECBC came in 2017 which sets parameters for builders, designers, and architects to integrate renewable energy sources in building design with the inclusion of passive design strategies. The code aims to optimize energy savings with the comfort levels for occupants and prefers life-cycle cost-effectiveness to achieve energy neutrality in commercial buildings.\n\n3. National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) under NAPCC\n\nThe National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) is one of the eight missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). NMEEE aims to strengthen the market for energy efficiency by creating conducive regulatory and policy regimes and has envisaged fostering innovative and sustainable business models in the energy efficiency sector.\n\nThe NMEEE has four initiatives to enhance energy efficiency in energy-intensive industries which are as follows:\n\nPerform, Achieve, and Trade Scheme (PAT):\n\nA market-based mechanism to enhance the cost-effectiveness in improving Energy Efficiency in Energy Intensive industries through certification of energy saving which can be traded.\n\nUnits that can achieve a specific energy consumption (SEC) level that is lower than their targets can receive energy savings certificates (ESCerts) for their excess savings.\n\nThe ESCerts could be traded on the Power Exchanges and bought by other units under PAT who can use them to meet their compliance requirements.\n\nMarket Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE):\n\nUnder MTEE, two programs have been developed i.e. Bachat Lamp Yojana(BLY) and Super-Efficient Equipment Programme (SEEP).\n\nBEE promotes the use of LED lights using the institutional structure of the BLY Programme. SEEP is a program designed to bring accelerated market transformation for super-efficient appliances by providing financial stimulus innovatively at critical point/s of intervention.\n\nEnergy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP):\n\nThis is a platform for the creation of mechanisms that would help finance demand-side management programs in all sectors by capturing future energy savings. Under this, MoUs have been signed with financial institutions to work together for the development of the energy efficiency market and the identification of issues related to this market development.\n\nFramework for Energy Efficient Economic Development (FEEED):\n\nThis is for the development of fiscal instruments to promote energy efficiency. Under this two initiatives are taken:\n\nPartial Risk Guarantee Fund for Energy Efficiency (PRGFEE) is risk risk-sharing mechanism to provide commercial banks with a partial coverage of risk involved in extending loans for energy efficiency projects.\n\nThe Venture Capital Fund for Energy Efficiency (VCFEE) is a fund to provide equity capital for energy efficiency projects. The support under VCFEE is limited to Government buildings and municipalities.\n\n4. School Education Program by\u00a0Bureau of Energy Efficiency and NCERT\n\nThere is a need to make the next generation more aware of the efficient use of energy resources. In this regard, promotion of energy efficiency in schools is being promoted through the establishment of Energy Clubs.\n\nThe Bureau of Energy Efficiency intends to prepare the text/material on Energy Efficiency and Conservation for its proposed incorporation in the existing science syllabi and science textbooks of NCERT for classes 6th to 10th.\n\n5. Human Resource Development (HRD)\n\nThe potential for improvement of energy efficiency of processes and equipment through awareness creation is vast. A sound policy for the creation, retention, and gradation of skills in Human Resources is crucial for the penetration of energy-efficient technologies and practices in various sectors.\n\nThe component under HRD comprises of theory cum practice-oriented training program and provides Energy Audit Instrument Support to the citizens.\n\n6. Promotion of Energy-Efficient LED Bulbs \u2013 UJALA scheme\n\nHon\u2019ble Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi described the LED bulb as the \u201cPrakash Path\u201d \u2013 the \u201cway to light\u201d. The initiative is part of the Government of India\u2019s efforts to spread the message of energy efficiency in the country.\n\nUJALA scheme aims to promote efficient use of energy at the residential level, enhance the awareness of consumers about the efficacy of using energy-efficient appliances, and aggregate demand to reduce the high initial costs thus facilitating higher uptake of LED lights by residential users. It may be noted that the scheme was initially labeled DELP (Domestic Efficient Lighting Program) and was relaunched as UJALA.\n\n7. Promotion of Electric vehicles: \u2013 National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP)\n\nThe government of India launched the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 in 2013. It aims to achieve national fuel security by promoting hybrid and electric vehicles in the country. There is an ambitious target to achieve 6-7 million sales of hybrid and electric vehicles year on year from 2020 onwards.\n\nThe government aims to provide fiscal and monetary incentives to kick-start this nascent technology; e.g. Demand-side incentives to facilitate the acquisition of hybrid/electric vehicles, Promoting R&D in technology including battery technology, power electronics, motors, systems integration, etc.\n\nThe government has launched the scheme namely Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles (FAME India) under NEMMP 2020 in the Union Budget for 2015-16. The scheme will provide a major push for early adoption and market creation of both hybrid and electric technologies vehicles in the country. The scheme has 4 focus areas i.e. Technology development, Demand Creation, Pilot Projects, and Charging Infrastructure.\n\nConclusion\n\n\u201cWe all have our personal doomsday scenarios with respect to an extremely \u201cEnergy Hungry \u201d world\u201d.\n\nThe Perform, Achieve, and Trade Scheme (PAT) scheme is a unique and innovative initiative, perhaps with no precedence anywhere else in the world. PAT would become a valuable model for\u00a0other countries to adopt for their energy efficiency programs from a business perspective. Standards and Labelling of equipment and appliance programs have created a market transformation.\n\nPS: If you come across any other initiatives or schemes by the Government or private sector for energy efficiency and energy conservation, feel free to mention the same in the comments.\n\nArticle by: Arun Kumar",

    "[CONTENT] #561": "A village named Neduvasal in the Pudukkottai district in Tamil Nadu has recently been in the news headlines. The reason is the launch of a hydrocarbon project. In this post, we cover everything you need to know about the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project controversy and policies like the Discovered Small Field Policy, NELP, and HELP.\n\nThe Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project is a controversial hydrocarbon extraction initiative located in the Neduvasal village in the Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu, India.\n\nThis project is part of a broader plan by the Government of India to increase domestic hydrocarbon production under the \u201cDiscovered Small Fields\u201d policy.\n\nThe policy aims to extract hydrocarbons from small, previously discovered fields that were not developed by major exploration companies, often due to economic or technological constraints.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a Hydrocarbon Project?\nWhat is the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project Controversy?\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: The Background\nWhat is Discovered Small Field Policy?\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: Who are the protestors?\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: What is the mode of protest?\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: What are the reasons put forward by the protestors?\nWhat are the possible advantages of the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project?\nWhat are the assurances given by the authorities about the extraction process?\nSummary\nWhat is a Hydrocarbon Project?\n\nIn organic chemistry, a hydrocarbon is an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon.\nHydrocarbon exploration (or oil and gas exploration) is the search for hydrocarbon deposits beneath the Earth\u2019s surface, such as oil and natural gas.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Hydrocarbons: How are they extracted?\n\nWhat is the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project Controversy?\nThe central government is planning to extract the hydrocarbon (oil and natural gas) in Neduvasal village in Pudukkottai district, Tamil Nadu.\nMany villagers are protesting against the proposed Hydrocarbon project.\nTheir fear is due to the possible impact the project can have on village life and agriculture.\nSimilar to the Jallikattu Ban, this protest is also gaining momentum.\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: The Background\n\nThe Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister on February 15, 2015, gave its approval for all the hydrocarbon projects including the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project as a part of the Centre\u2019s 2015 \u2018Discovered Small Fields policy\u2019.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe two contract areas, Karaikal (10.4 sq km) located in Puducherry and Neduvasal (10.0 sq km) located in Tamil Nadu were awarded under Discovered Small Field (DSF) bidding round.\n\nThey have an in-place volume of 4,30,000 metric tons of oil and oil equivalent gas.\n\nThe proposed Hydrocarbon Project at Neduvasal village in Pudukkottai district was recommended for award to GEM Laboratories Private Limited, a company based out of Davangere in Karnataka for extracting both oil and natural gas from hydrocarbon sediments in an area of about 10.0 sq km.\n\nWhat is Discovered Small Field Policy?\nThe Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi (CCEA) has approved the award of 31 contract areas as part of the Discovered Small Field (DSF) Bid Round 2016.\nThe contract was for 44 oilfields (in 31 contract areas), including 28 on-land and 16 offshore fields discovered by Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL)\nThese fields were offered under the new policy for small fields known as the Discovered Small Field (DSF) policy, 2015, which offers improved fiscal terms to enhance Oil and gas production and reduce import dependency of the country.\nThese fields were offered through a transparent international competitive bidding process. The bidding was open to all, including National Oil Companies (i.e. ONGC and OIL) and other central and state PSUs.\nThe\u00a0Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) replaced the previous licensing format (NELP) which was already in place for 18 years.\nThe New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) had issued separate licenses to different types of hydrocarbons, whereas HELP covered all hydrocarbons such as oil, gas, coal bed methane, etc.\nCurrently, there are three Operational Exploration Blocks (Approximately 1461 sq km), under the Production Sharing Contract System in Tamil Nadu where hydrocarbon exploration is going on.\nUnder the Nomination regime, 31 Mining leases (approximately 3500 sq km) have been granted in the State from where 600 tonnes of Oil and 30 lakhs cubic meters of Natural Gas are produced per day.\nTo date, more than 700 wells have been drilled for the extraction of Oil and Gas in Tamil Nadu.\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: Who are the protestors?\n\nThe villagers along with students, environmental activists, and farmers of Neduvasal, resorted to fasting at four centres across the district as a protest against the upcoming Hydrocarbon project.\nThe movement gained momentum when it attracted several people from the nearby villages to voice their support for the cause of the farmers.\nThe protest got support from social media.\nResidents of Vadakadu, where ONGC had sunk an exploratory well but abandoned the project, joined the protests.\nPolitical leaders and film personalities like Samathuva Makkal Katchi leader Sarath Kumar, film directors Pandiraj and Thangar Bachan, DMK MLAs C. Ve. Meyyanathan, S. Ragupathy, and Durai Chandrasekaran expressed their wholesome support to the protest.\nThe state had witnessed similar protests in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts in the Cauvery Delta region from 2011 against the coal bed methane and shale gas extraction project\u2014 for extracting methane gas using hydraulic fracturing\u2014 leading the Centre to scrap the project in November 2016.\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: What is the mode of protest?\nA large contingent of students from Chennai, Erode, Namakkal and Pudukkottai districts took part in a fast at Neduvasal village.\nSimilar fasting protests were held in Thilagar Thidal, Nallandarkollai and Kottaikadu villages.\nA group of activists from \u2018Thaneer\u2019 (an organization based in Tiruchi) took out a bike rally to Neduvasal to express their opposition to the project. But they were arrested by the police before reaching the destination place.\nNeduvasal Hydrocarbon Project: What are the reasons put forward by the protestors?\nThis hydrocarbon project would pose severe environmental problems and adversely affect the livelihood of farmers in and around Neduvasal.\nThe farmers also claimed that the fertility of the land would be affected.\nThere is also apprehension regarding the lowering of groundwater levels.\nThe displacement of the habitation of the people in the village.\nThe villagers also fear that this project may disturb the interface of the seawater and groundwater which may later result in the intrusion of saline water into the freshwater sources.\nThere may be no agricultural activity while the hydrocarbon exploration is on. The villagers in and around Neduvasal are completely dependent on agriculture for their livelihood and this may seriously affect their life pattern.\nThe government didn\u2019t have any information related to the exact location of hydrocarbon exploration and there is no clarity in how the crude oil will be extracted.\nWhat are the possible advantages of the Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project?\nThis is a major step towards self-sufficiency in crude oil production.\nThe Government of India aims to use the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) to reduce India\u2019s crude imports by 10% by 2022.\nIt aims to net revenue of Rs 9,300 crore from this project out of which the state is expected to get Rs 5,000 crore.\nThis project is believed to pass economic benefits to the State and its people in the form of royalty, VAT, additional employment generation and economic development as per the petroleum ministry.\nWhat are the assurances given by the authorities about the extraction process?\nThe extraction of Oil and Gas from sub-surface is a well-established practice and the Exploration and Production industry uses state-of-the-art technology for operations and takes maximum care for environmental effects.\nThe operators also get an Environment Impact Assessment done before carrying out any drilling activities and other activities.\nThe process of drilling and production requires a very limited surface land area (120X120 square meters) which will not affect agriculture or the soil of the entire lease area.\nAdditionally, operators are required to follow strict environmental norms for the use of operational land.\nThe oil and gas extraction is being carried out from deeper earth areas (more than 1000m) and thus doesn\u2019t affect groundwater aquifers which are located at much shallower levels.\nHydrocarbon extraction method is being used worldwide which has not seen any direct impact on water resources of the mining area.\nWhile drilling for oil and gas, cement casing is used; hence, there is no impact on groundwater as such.\nSummary\nNeduvasal, a fertile village of the Cauvery delta bordering Pudukottai and Thanjavur districts, is one of the 31 contract areas of small fields where exploration of hydrocarbons is to be taken up as per a recent decision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.\nVillagers claim that no information has been given to them on the project so far. They are apprehensive that the project would lead to a depletion of the water table and deprive them of their livelihood.\nChief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami gave assurances that any project which negatively affects farmers would not be allowed in the State.\n\nThe Neduvasal Hydrocarbon Project highlights the broader national and global debate on fossil fuel dependency, energy policy, and sustainable development. It underscores the challenges of balancing energy security with environmental sustainability and local community welfare, a dynamic seen in many parts of the world where local resources are tapped to meet national or global energy demands.\n\nArticle by: Priyanka Sunil",

India is used to trade with foreign nations even in BC.\n\nThe Periplus of the Erythraean Sea is a document (written by an anonymous sailor from Alexandria about AD 100) describing trade between countries, including India.\n\nSince 1498, Europeans have traded with the rulers of India using the sea route. The main export items then were spices like pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, mace, and cloves.\n\nFrom 1947-1991, the Indian economy remained largely as a closed economy. High taxes were levied on the import of items. Foreign investments like FDI were restricted.\n\nHowever, after the liberalization in 1991, foreign trade improved significantly.\n\nAlso read: India\u2019s Free Trade Agreements \u2013 The \u2018present\u2019 and the \u2018future\u2019\n\nExports and Imports\n\nNow, India exports around 7500 commodities to about 190 countries, and imports around 6000 commodities from 140 countries. Exports and Imports are not only restricted to commodities (merchandise). Service is also a major export/import item.\n\nTo make it simple, let\u2019s summarise foreign trade of India as below:\n\nExport of goods (merchandise/commodities)\nExport of services\nImport of goods (merchandise/commodities)\nImport of services\nBalance of Trade (BoT)\n\nBalance of Trade (BoT) is also known as Trade Balance.\n\nBalance of Trade (Merchandise) = Export of goods \u2013 Import of goods\n\nBalance of Trade (Services) = Export of services \u2013 Import of services\n\nNote: In general, if someone mentions Balance of Trade, he/she is intending only the Balance of Trade (Merchandise)\n\nExports of India: Facts You Need to Know\nTop Export Items: Petroleum products, precious stones, drug formulations & biologicals, gold, and other precious metals are the top exported commodities.\nIndia\u2019s merchandise exports are less than its merchandise imports.\nStill, India\u2019s merchandise trade balance has improved from 2009-14 to 2014-19 although most of the improvement in the latter period was on account of a more than fifty percent decline in crude prices in 2016-17.\nImports of India: Facts you need to know\nTop Import Items: Crude petroleum, gold, petroleum products, coal, coke & briquettes constitute top import items.\nIndia\u2019s service exports are more than its service imports. This means that India has a net service surplus.\nHowever, India\u2019s net services surplus has been steadily declining in relation to GDP.\nNow, India\u2019s service surplus finances about 50 percent of the merchandise deficit (the trade balance).\nTop Trading Partners of India\n\nIndia\u2019s top five trading partners continue to be the USA, China, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Hong Kong.\n\nTop 10 Export Commodities\nPetroleum Products\nPearl, Precious, Semiprecious Stones\nDrug Formulations, Biologicals\nGold and Other Precious Metal Jewellery\nIron and Steel\nElectric Machinery and equipment\nOrganic Chemicals\nRMG Cotton including Accessories\nMotor Vehicles/ Cars\nMarine Products\nTop 10 Countries to which India exports the most\nU S A\nUAE\nChina PRP\nHong Kong\nSingapore\nUnited Kingdom\nNetherland\nGermany\nBangladesh PR\nNepal\nService Exports: Top Services\n\nThe composition of service exports has remained largely unchanged over the years.\n\nSoftware services constitute the bulk of it at around 40-45 percent, followed by business services at about 18-20 percent, travel at 11-14 percent, and transportation at 9-11 percent.\n\nAlso read: Export Preparedness Index\n\nTop 10 Import Commodities\nPetroleum: Crude\nGold\nPetroleum Products\nCoal, Coke Briquettes, etc.\nPearl, Precious, Semiprecious Stones\nElectronic Components\nTelecom Instruments\nOrganic Chemicals\nIndustrial Machinery for Dairy etc.\nIron and Steel\nTop 10 Countries from which India imports the most\nChina PRP\nUSA\nUAE\nSaudi Arabia\nIraq\nSwitzerland\nHong Kong\nKorea RP\nSingapore\nIndonesia\nService Imports: Top Services\n\nOver the years, service imports in relation to GDP have been steadily rising putting pressure on BoP to worsen.\n\nHowever, the increase in service imports to GDP ratio is inevitable given a rising level of FDI and a gradual upscaling of the Make in India program.\n\nBusiness Services, Travel, and Transportation are the three top service imports.\n\nBalance of Payments (BoP)\n\nBalance of Payments (BoP) statistics systematically summarise, for a specific period, the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world.\n\nThe compilation and dissemination of BoP data is the prime responsibility of RBI.\n\nBoP = net credit in ( Current Account + Capital Account and Financial Account).\n\nIndia\u2019s Balance of Payments (BoP) position witnessed great improvement since liberalization in 1991.\n\nIndia\u2019s foreign reserves stood at US$ 572 billion as on November 2020.\n\nForeign Exchange (Forex) Reserves include Foreign Currency Assets, Gold,\u00a0 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), and Reserve Position in the IMF (Gold Tranche or Reserve Tranche).\n\nGlobal Trade\n\nGlobal Trade was growing at 5.7 percent in 2017. However, in 2019-20, it is estimated to grow only at 1.0 percent.\n\nEase of Doing Business: Performance of India\n\nIndia now ranks 68 out of the 190 countries under the indicator \u201cTrading across Borders\u201d in the Ease of Doing Business Report published by the World Bank. (2019)\n\nLogistics Industry in India\n\nThe logistics industry of India is currently estimated to be around US$ 160 billion and is expected to reach US$ 215 billion by 2020.\n\nNet Remittances from Indians employed overseas\n\nNet Remittances are part of the Current Account in the Balance of Payments statement published by RBI.\n\nNet remittances from Indians employed overseas have been constantly increasing year after year.\n\nFDI Inflows and FPI Inflows\n\nFDI and FPI are showing a positive trend in recent years.\n\nExternal Debt\n\nAfter witnessing a significant decline from 2014-15, India\u2019s external liabilities (debt and equity) to GDP increased at the end of June 2019 primarily driven by an increase in FDI, portfolio flows, and external commercial borrowings (ECBs).\n\nExternal debt as of the end of September 2019 remains low at 20.1 percent of GDP.\n\nForeign Trade Policy of India\n\nThe Foreign Trade Policy, 2015-20,\u00a0 notified by the Central Government, is an exercise of powers conferred under Section 5 of the Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1992 OR FT (D&R) Act.\n\nWho regulates Export Trade in India?\n\nExport trade is regulated by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) and its regional offices, functioning under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Department of Commerce, Government of India.\n\nPolicies and procedures required to be followed for exports from India are announced by the DGFT, from time to time.\n\nAlso read: Non-Tariff Barriers to Trade;\u00a0India\u2019s trade deficit\n\nUPSC Question based on International Trade of India\n\n[Question UPSC CSE 2020]\u00a0 With reference to the international trade of India at present, which of the following statements is/are correct?\n1) India\u2019s merchandise exports are less than its merchandise imports.\n2) India\u2019s imports of iron and steel, chemicals, fertilizers, and machinery have decreased in recent years,\n3) India\u2019s exports of services are more than its imports of services.\n4) India suffers from an overall trade/current account deficit.\n\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below:\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only\n(b) 2 and 4 only\n(c) 3 only\n(d) 1, 3 and 4 only\n\nAnswer: (d) 1, 3 and 4 only\n\nLearning Zone: The merchandise trade deficit is the largest component of India\u2019s Current Account Deficit (CAD). As per RBI\u2019s data, India\u2019s merchandise exports are higher than that of imports. Hence statement 1 is correct\n\nCommodity-wise composition of imports shows that imports of iron and steel, organic chemicals, and industrial machinery have registered positive growth rates as % of share imports. Hence statement 2 is incorrect.\n\nAs you learned in this article, India\u2019s net services (service exports \u2013 service imports) have been in surplus. Hence statement 3 is correct.\n\nTrade Deficit is usually taken as the difference between the exports of goods minus the import of goods. Current Account Deficit (CAD) denotes the net export of goods, services, and transfer payments. India has both a Balance of Trade Deficit as well as a Current Account Deficit (CAD). Hence statement 4 is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is (d) 1, 3, and 4 only.",

These terms are connected with international trade accounting.\n\nIn this post, we provide a mind-map approach to studying the Balance of Payments. We hope the same would help in quick understanding and revision.\n\nAlso read: Currency Carry Trade\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Balance of Payments (BoP)?\nBalance of Payments: Mindmap\nWhat would happen if a country spends more than it receives from abroad?\nFilling Current Account Deficit with Foreign Exchange Reserves\nIdeally, BoP should be Zero!

But, in countries like India, the financial account is included in the capital account itself.\nBalance of Payments: Mindmap\n\nWhat would happen if a country spends more than it receives from abroad?\n\nWhat would happen if an\u00a0individual spends more than his income? He must finance the same by some other means, right? It may\u00a0be by borrowing or by selling assets.\n\nThe same way, if a country has a deficit in its current account (spending more abroad than it receives from sales to the rest of the world), it must finance it by borrowing abroad or selling assets.\u00a0Thus, any current account deficit is of necessity financed by a net capital inflow.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFilling Current Account Deficit with Foreign Exchange Reserves\n\nA country could also engage in official reserve transactions, running down its reserves of foreign exchange, in the case of a deficit by selling foreign currency in the foreign exchange market. But,\u00a0official reserve transactions are more relevant under a regime of pegged exchange rates than when exchange rates are floating.\n\nA country is said to be in balance of payments equilibrium when the sum of its current account and its non-reserve capital account equals zero so that the current account balance is financed entirely by international lending without reserve movements.\n\nNote:\u00a0A BOP surplus is accompanied by an accumulation of\u00a0foreign exchange reserves by the central bank.\n\nAlso read: Internationalisation of Rupee\n\nIdeally, BoP should be Zero! How?\n\nFrom a balance of international payments point of view, a surplus on the current account would allow a deficit to be run on the capital account. For example, surplus foreign currency can be used to fund investment in assets located overseas. Also, if a country has a current account deficit (trade deficit), it will borrow from abroad.\n\nIn reality, the accounts do not exactly offset each other, because of statistical discrepancies, accounting conventions and exchange rate movements that change the recorded value of transactions.\n\nHow is the Balance of Payments Calculated?\n\nThe sum of the current account and capital account indicates the overall balance, which could either be in surplus or in deficit.\n\nBalance of Payments is the net credit in Current Account and Capital Account.\n\nBoP = net credit in ( Current Account + Capital Account and Financial Account).\n\nBoP Deficit or Surplus\nThe decrease (increase) in official reserves is called the overall balance of payments deficit (surplus).\nThe balance of payments deficit or surplus is obtained after adding the current and capital account balances.\nThe balance of payments surplus will be considered as an addition to official reserves (reserve use).\nBoP Crisis\nCountries with current account deficits can run into difficulties. If the deficit is large and the economy is not able to attract enough inflows of foreign investment, then their currency reserves will dwindle.\nThere may come a point when the country needs to seek emergency borrowing from institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, that may lead to external debt.\nCountries with deficits in their current accounts will build up increasing debt and/or see increased foreign ownership of their assets.\nBoP crisis is also known as the currency crisis.\nAutonomous Transactions vs\u00a0\u00a0Accommodating Transactions\nInternational economic transactions are called autonomous when transactions are made independently of the state of the BoP (for instance due to profit motive).\nThese items are called \u2018above the line\u2019 items in the BoP.\nThe balance of payments is said to be in surplus (deficit) if autonomous receipts are greater (less) than autonomous payments.\nAccommodating transactions (termed \u2018below the line\u2019 items), on the other hand, are determined by the net consequences of the autonomous items, that is, whether the BoP is in surplus or deficit.\nThe official reserve transactions are seen as the accommodating item in the BoP (all others being autonomous).\nErrors and Omissions\n\nErrors and Omissions constitute the third element in the BoP (apart from the current and capital accounts) which is the \u2018balancing item\u2019 reflecting our inability to record all international transactions accurately.\n\nBoT\u00a0vs BoP\n\nThe balance of Trade (BoT) or Trade Balance is a part of the Balance of Payments (BoP). BoT just includes the balance between export and import of goods.\nBoP not only adds the service-trade but also many other components in the current account (Eg: Transfer payments) and capital account (FDI, loans etc).\n\nRead: India\u2019s trade deficit\n\nRupee Convertibility\n\nThe Indian rupee is fully convertible only in the current account and not in the capital account.\n\nBoP: Latest Convention (BPM6 format)\n\nThe BoP can be broadly divided into two accounts namely, (a) current account, and (b) capital and financial account.\n\nThe current account measures the transfer of real resources (goods, services, income and transfers) between an economy and the rest of the world.\n\nThe capital and financial account reflect the net changes in financial claims on the rest of the world.\n\nThe current account is further subdivided into a merchandise account and an Invisibles account. The merchandise account consists of transactions relating to exports and imports of goods. In the invisible account, there are three broad categories namely, (a) non-factor services such as travel, transportation, insurance and miscellaneous services; (b) transfers which do not involve any value in exchange, and (c) income which includes compensation of employees and investment income.\n\nThe capital account can be broadly broken up into two categories namely, (a) non-debt flows such as direct and portfolio investments, and (b) debt flows such as external assistance, commercial borrowings, non-resident deposits, etc.\n\nThe sum of the current account and capital account indicates the overall balance, which could either be in surplus or in deficit.\n\nThe movement in overall balance is reflected in changes in the international reserves of the country.\n\nThings to note:\nBalance of Payments (BoP) statistics systematically summarise, for a specific period, the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world.\nThe compilation and dissemination of BoP data is the prime responsibility of RBI.\nIf an Indian investor earns interest or dividend in his investment abroad, that will be included in the current account of India.\nIf FDI is made by an American company in India, that investment will be accounted in the capital account of India.\nNRI deposits are calculated under Capital Accounts while Private Remittances are calculated under Current Account.\nIn general, National Income (Y) = Private Consumption Expenditure (C) + Investment (I) + Government Expenditure (G) + Net Exports (E).\nIn a closed economy, Savings (S) = Investment (I).\nIn an open economy, Savings (S) = Investment (I) + Net Exports (E)\nOR, Net Exports = Savings \u2013 Investment. This is actually the Balance of Trade (Trade Balance).",

Trade without barriers \u2013 free trade \u2013 is promoted by institutions like the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In this background, \u00a0as an emerging superpower, India\u2019s Free Trade Agreements deserve special attention.\n\nIn this article, let us analyze some of the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) signed by India and some of the new/proposed FTAs.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Free Trade Agreements (FTA)?\nIndia- ASEAN Free Trade Agreement\nEconomic Perspective\nChallenges in India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement\nIndia and RCEP\nAdvantages for India\nChallenges for India\nSouth Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)\nIndia-European Union Free Trade Agreement (Proposed)\nFuture of the Free Trade Agreements and India\u2019s stand on them\nWhat are Free Trade Agreements (FTA)?\n\nA Free Trade Agreement is an agreement between countries to reduce or eliminate trade barriers. Trade barriers include tariff barriers like taxes and nontariff barriers like regulatory laws.\n\nTrade barriers\u00a0include tariff barriers like taxes and nontariff barriers like regulatory laws.\n\nA Free Trade Agreement or FTA is an agreement between two or more countries where the countries agree on certain obligations that affect trade in goods and services, and protections for investors and intellectual property rights, among other topics.\n\nIndia- ASEAN Free Trade Agreement\nRecently, India and The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) completed 25 years of cooperation and partnership.\nWith the initiation of economic reforms in India from 1991 onwards, the then government initiated the \u2018Look East Policy\u2019 which was particularly focused on Southeast Asia and East Asia.\nThe successive governments rigorously implemented the policy. With the regime change in 2014, there was an upgrade of the \u2018Look East Policy\u2019 to the \u2018Act East Policy\u2019.\nThe India-ASEAN relationship and ties go way back in history. Culturally, Southeast Asia has borrowed heavily from India and there were even Indian kings who went to Southeast Asian lands and established new dynasties there.\nWith the end of the colonization era, slowly the ties between India and ASEAN started to develop yet again.\nThere was increasing contact between people and this led to a rise in exchanges and even economically.\nLook East Policy was a game-changer and after that, there has been no looking back and only growth of relations between the two regions.\nEconomic Perspective\nThe Economic relation is a pillar on which the two region\u2019s partnership rests. In this context, with the enforcement of the \u2018Look East Policy\u2019 there were growing trade relations in goods and investments. After the India-ASEAN free trade agreement was created in 2003, trade relations boomed even further.\nIn 2009, the Free Trade Agreement in Goods was signed and enacted in 2010. The ASEAN-India Free Trade Area (AIFTA) has been completed with the entry into force of the ASEAN-India Agreements on Trade in Service and Investments on 1 July 2015. With this, India will stand to gain as it has always asked for an FTA that will be more comprehensive and include services which has been India\u2019s stronger sector.\nThe ASEAN nations and India together consist of one of the largest economic regions with a total population of about 1.8 billion. ASEAN is currently India\u2019s fourth largest trading partner, accounting for 10.2 per cent of India\u2019s total trade. India, on the other hand, is ASEAN\u2019s 7th\u00a0largest trading partner.\nIndia\u2019s service-oriented economy perfectly complements the manufacturing-based economies of the ASEAN countries. The annual trade between India and ASEAN stood at approximately US$ 76.53 billion in 2014-15. However, it dropped to US$ 65.04 billion in 2015-16 due to declining commodity prices against the backdrop of a sluggish global economy.\nInvestment flows are quite remarkable both ways, with ASEAN accounting for approximately 12.5 per cent of investment flows into India since 2000. Singapore is the primary hub for both inward and outward investments.\u00a0Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India from ASEAN between April 2000 and May 2016 were about US$49.40 billion. FDI outflows from India to ASEAN countries, from April 2007 to March 2015, according to data from the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), was about US$38.672 billion.\nTo enhance economic and strategic relations with the Southeast Asian countries, the Indian government has put in place a Project Development Fund to set up manufacturing hubs in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam(CMLV) countries through separate Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs).\nChallenges in India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement\n\nEven though the Trade Agreement with ASEAN has helped trade grow immensely with India, still, the issue remains that the agreement has benefitted the ASEAN region more than India.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWith the agreement on goods signed, the domestic markets have faced stiff competition because they have to compete with the cheaper goods of the ASEAN region.\nFor example, the rubber imports from Malaysia, and palm oil imports from Indonesia have made it a tough ordeal for the local manufacturers of palm oil and rubber, especially the rubber plantations of Kerala who have complained about the cheaper imports ever since the agreement was about to be signed.\nThe other drawback of the agreement is that the agreement in services hasn\u2019t reaped many benefits for India. According to ASEAN rules, until all the nations have ratified the FTAs in their Legislatures, the FTA will not be enforced.\nThis has caused much trouble for India as the Philippines hasn\u2019t ratified the FTA in services there will be direct competition between India and the Philippines in direct competition in services which would be a disadvantage for the latter.\nOver the years, with the statistics and trade figures, it can be easily deciphered that the trade imbalance in favour of ASEAN and India has an expanding trade deficit with the region which dearly hurts its Current Account Deficit and thus, hurts India\u2019s overall financial.\nIndia and RCEP\n\nRegional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, also known as RCEP is a mega trade block that is being negotiated between the ten members of the ASEAN group and six other members namely South Korea, Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and India.\n\nIt is a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that is being proposed amongst these nations which will include goods and services, investments, intellectual property rights, economic and technical cooperation, and dispute settlement.\nIf negotiated and enforced, it will be one of the largest trading blocs in the world. With a combined Gross Domestic Product of almost $17 trillion and covering more than 40 per cent of the world\u2019s trade. It also covers more than 3 billion people.\nThe bloc aims at tariff liberalization amongst the nations and so, there will be easier market access amongst all the nations amongst themselves.\n\nAlso read: Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) \u2013 Will it counter TPP?\n\nAdvantages for India\nFor India, which is not a part of the other major trade blocs of the world, such as Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), this free trade agreement would prove to be of advantage as earlier it was feared that with the presence of these trade blocs and the negotiation of their FTAs, India might lose out its market share, especially in case of textiles, pharmaceuticals and medicines etc. to other Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam.\nAlso, with India already having an FTA with ASEAN Japan, and South Korea, with the negotiation of the RCEP, it will complement India\u2019s pre-existing FTAs and will allow better access to consumer markets in other nations.\nWith the FTA being negotiated even in services, it will add to the advantage for India where they have a comparative advantage over other nations, especially in the context of Information Technology related services, healthcare services, and educational services.\nChallenges for India\nThe agricultural sector of India, which faces issues like lack of investment, low productivity, obsolete technology, and fragmented landholdings will suffer even more as with the negotiation of the RCEP agreement, now, the Indian market will be flooded with products from other nations which are comparatively cheaper and have a more efficient agricultural sector.\nThe already negotiated FTA with ASEAN has hurt the interests of some particular communities such as rubber plantations and palm oil production. Also, the allied sectors, such as the dairy sector in India, which still is not at a mature stage, will face stiff competition from countries like New Zealand which has a very strong dairy sector and their economy thrives on the same.\nAlso, the industrial sector of India is still in a nascent stage. In the context of goods, India has already given up on a three-tier tariff reduction proposal that would offer different coverage for ASEAN, Japan, and South Korea and a much lower level of tariff reduction coverage for Australia, China, and New Zealand.\nWith the agreement on the intellectual property rights to be negotiated, which is being pressurized by Japan, this will lead to the issue that India may lose its status as the pharmaceutical hub of the world. Agreeing to data exclusivity, extending patenting terms and unduly strong enforcement measures will weaken the generic pharmaceutical sector and will come in direct conflict with section 3(d) of the Indian Patents Act.\nThis will make medicines expensive and inaccessible not just for Indians but for the entire developing world. India has already resisted pressure not succumbing to dilute the provisions of the European Union and the FTA to be proposed with the same. Thus, diluting the measures in this context might again open a Pandora\u2019s box for India.\nAlso, in the case of the services sector, where India is assuming and pitching for gains, it remains to be seen whether it will duly gain or not. India is pitching for Mode 3 and Mode 4 type gains. With Mode 4 types of gains highly unlikely to be awarded, in the context of Mode 3, except in the case of Information Technology and Information Technology Enabled Services, it remains to be seen whether it will benefit India much or not.\nFinally, to conclude, the FTA will pose a big challenge to the \u2018Make in India\u2019 program which the current government is aggressively promoting. For example, the granting of tariff-free access to Chinese goods, which have already flooded the Indian markets and have decimated the Indian goods and markets will further aggravate the situation and add to increase the budget deficit with China.\nSouth Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)\n\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation or SAARC, as it is known, is a region comprising of all the South-Asian nations or the subcontinent i.e. India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and the other two countries namely Afghanistan and Maldives. It was conceived to improve the interrelationships between the nations and improve people-to-people contact as all the people are united culturally but divided by the borders.\nIn this context, the concept of the South-Asia Free Trade Agreement or SAFTA was conceived for the first time in 1993 as a Preferential Trade Agreement ( an agreement amongst the nations to trade selected goods without tariffs or with very low tariffs) and later, it was upgraded to a Free Trade Agreement in 2004 and came into force in 2006. This was done to improve trade and economic relations amongst the member nations of SAARC.\nWith the classification of nations as Least Developing Countries and Non-Least Developing Countries, there was a creation of an equal platform for all the players in the region so that the Free Trade Agreement would not lead to issues for the domestic markets.\nHowever, despite more than ten years after the enactment of the FTA, the trade growth amongst the member nations is meagre. This puts a question mark on the concept of the creation of an FTA in the region. Because of the geopolitical scenario of the subcontinent, there have always been contentious issues among the neighbours. For example, India and Pakistan have always had their differences and their relationship becomes the elephant in the room in case of any summit and negotiations to be done. Also, the proximity of Pakistan to China has added to the troubles.\nOther smaller nations have also played the China card again and again against India which has led to a void in the confidence among the nations. The trade amongst the nations is so poor that it comprises only five per cent of the total trade of the nations.\nThe clause of \u2018sensitive list\u2019 has also hurt trade prospects which each nation apprehensive of losing out on its domestic industry as compared to the other nations and thus, has included quite a many of the list of goods and services to be traded in the sensitive list. When included in the list, the products become immune from tariff concession.\nIndia-European Union Free Trade Agreement (Proposed)\nIndia-European Union (EU) FTA, officially known as the Broad-Based Trade and Investment Agreement has been negotiated for quite a while. However, in 2013, there was a breakdown in talks between the two sides and the talks have been stalled ever since. The European Union wants India to reduce the import duties on alcohol and automobiles and India wants the EU to declare India as a \u2018data secure\u2019 country.\nAlso, in 2016, India unilaterally terminated Bilateral Investment Treaties with many countries across the world, with many of them being European nations. This has added to the increased scepticism of the nations who have question marks over the future investments to be made in India.\nThe reason why the Bilateral treaties have been terminated is that India has put forward its condition of exhausting all the judicial and litigation measures available in the country first and then only going for international litigation or arbitration. The 2016 Model Indian Bilateral Investment Treaty requires the foreign investor to litigate for at least five years in the national courts before approaching the international tribunal.\nIn contrast, the EU and Canada had put forward the idea of an Investor-State Dispute Mechanism at the global level in which the foreign investors in a country can drag the government to the international arbitration centres without exhausting the local litigation means and claim huge losses citing losses they suffered due to various reasons, including policy changes. This has been summarily rejected by India, Argentina as well and Japan. Japan has been opposing it because international arbitration will involve huge costs whereas India wants the foreign investors to exhaust the national judicial remedies and then only go for international arbitration.\nFuture of the Free Trade Agreements and India\u2019s stand on them\n\nThe unilateral termination of the BITs with so many nations should be reviewed, especially when India is being projected as a bright spot in the global economy.\n\nThe move comes as a regressive step as it increases the confusion of the foreign investors who wish to invest in India. Also, the clause which says at least five years of national litigation is necessary after which the international tribunals can be approached looks like a step in the wrong direction.\n\nThis goes against the government\u2019s slogan of \u2018More Governance, Less Government\u2019 and against the concept of \u2018Ease of Doing Business\u2019 in the nation.\n\nRegarding the FTAs, India should be very careful in the clauses of negotiation. Despite having a strong services sector in a select few categories, ( IT, ITES, Healthcare and Education, etc.) the agricultural sector as well as the industrial sector, especially the Micro, Small, and Medium Scale Enterprises are still not as mature and strong as compared to the other countries with which India is negotiating FTAs.\n\nFor the sake of gaining an advantage in the services sector and access to foreign markets in services, which are also not completely accessible because of the nation\u2019s reservations, India ends up compromising on the primary and secondary sectors which affects too many livelihoods and the economy overall.\n\nThus, the negotiations at an international level should be done only after proper deliberation and understanding of the situation.\n\nAlso read: Foreign Trade of India: Concepts of International Trade\n\nArticle by: Aadarsh Clerk",

Hence it benefits Indian companies to raise funds via issuing Masala Bonds.\nIt helps to internationalize the Indian rupee as international investors become more familiar with the Indian rupee, the Indian economy, and its growth prospects.\nThere will be a fall in foreign currency-denominated external commercial borrowings (ECB) with an increase in the popularity of masala bonds. This will create a favorable position in the debt market concerning exchange risks.\nIt\u2019ll help in the development of domestic bond markets due to competition from overseas investors. This, in turn, will create a new venue for retail investors.\nIssues\nAccording to Moody, the sustainability of financing via Masala Bonds is a challenge as investors are expected to be cautious in taking on currency risks from emerging markets.\nFurther, periodical rate cuts by RBI have made Masala Bonds less appealing to investors.\nThe possibility of higher\u00a0taxes\u00a0also has undermined the utility of the instrument.\nExchange rate risks are still borne by the issuing economy if foreign investors redeem their holdings of Indian masala bonds in bulk due to reasons such as changing international interest rates or deteriorating macroeconomic fundamentals in India.

The rising demand for Dim-sum bonds has promoted the use of the yuan in global trade and also provided investment avenues for yuan-holders outside of China.\n\nOffshore rupee liquidity and secondary market trading are needed to be established for the masala bond market to become a sustainable source of funding for Indian issuers. An increase in secondary trading will happen when the number of issuances increases. This will help in setting a benchmark for future deals.\n\nHowever, experts warn that too much reliance on external debt even in rupees can impact our rating by global agencies.

Of course, the funds can come from abroad (foreign investment), but without proper utilization of resources in a country, there cannot be sustainable growth.\n\nGrowth and Development\n\nWhen the national income increases (growth), ideally it should result in development (qualitative aspect \u2013 like health, education, employment etc.). There can also be cases when growth does not percolate to the bottom of the pyramid \u2013 non inclusive growth \u2013 that will not result in the development of weaker sections of the society. For sustainable development, inclusive growth is a must.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGrowth and Employment\n\nGrowth generates employment and employment generates further growth. In general, employment corresponds to the qualitative aspect of growth. If a country is on the growth trajectory, it will generate more employment opportunities and while the growth declines ( periods of recession), people start losing jobs.\n\nBack to the growth topic again\u2026\n\nHow to generate growth? What are the issues in growth, development and employment?\u00a0Is India growing? Are there issues with India\u2019s growth or development? \u2013 There should not be any doubt about the fact that India is growing. India is now growing at 5% per year. But the problem with India is that it was growing at near 9% three years back! So the growth has declined \u2013 That is the first issue with our growth.\n\nIssues in India\u2019s growth, development and employment:\nIndia\u2019s growth is declining. (currently at 5%).\nIndia\u2019s growth is largely contributed to by the service sector. There is stagnation in the manufacturing sector.\nIndian agriculture is still heavily dependent on monsoon. Nearly 50 % of the population dependent on agriculture which contributes only 14% of GDP.\nFor a country to grow, there should be investment in productive areas. There should also be supporting infrastructure. Currently India has issues in both.\nDue to external and internal factors, there is decline in foreign investment. This is widening our Current Account Deficit.\nFor providing welfare schemes, subsidies and defense expenditure, India is borrowing. The Fiscal Deficit of India is enlarging.\nIndia\u2019s export sector is not growing in accordance with the demands of import goods.\nGrowth is not entirely inclusive. There are still a significant portion of people below poverty line.\nThere are issues with employment too. Though the unemployment rate is in single digit now, most of the employment in India is disguised unemployment. (In agricultural sector). The average salary and per-capita income of Indians are very low.\n\n[Growth, Development and Employment: Specifically mentioned in\u00a0Civil Service Mains GS Paper 3.

    "[CONTENT] #588": "Before going deep into Investment Models, let\u2019s analyse another basic aspect : What is investment? Investment has slightly different meanings in economics and finance, but a combined definition can be as \u201cInvestment is the process of putting money in assets for increasing production or financial gains\u201c.\n\nYes,\u00a0investment is all about putting money in assets. And, the investment models speak about how to put the money in assets.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUnderstanding Investment in Detail\nRelation between Investment and GDP:\nFactors affecting Investment\nInvestment Models for UPSC Mains Exam :\nProject Finance Schemes and Finance Models : Understanding Models\nInvestment Models in Relation With India\nDifferent Models of Investment and Planning related to India includes:\nFactors affecting Investment Sentiments\nMock questions on Investment Models for UPSC Mains\nUnderstanding Investment in Detail\n\n[Investment Models: Specifically mentioned in\u00a0Civil Service Mains GS Paper 3. It can also be asked for\u00a0Prelims\u00a0and\u00a0Interview]\n\nFor a first hand understanding on investment, consider it as putting money in banks deposits, shares of companies, real estate, gold, business or industry. For a country to grow (and generate employment opportunities to all), it should produce more goods and services, and hence investments in business, agriculture or industry or supporting infrastructure is highly appreciated.\n\nIf government has sufficient funds to invest in these areas, then it seems well and fine, but a nation like India with a Fiscal Deficit of 5.1% of GDP cannot ask Government to take care of all investment needs. The investment should come from private players too and that\u2019s a win-win situation for all!\n\nRelation between Investment and GDP:\n\nGDP, the measure of national income is given by the formula : GDP = C + I + G + NX, where C is the consumption expenditure, G is government spending, and NX is net exports, given by the difference between the exports and imports, X \u2212 M.\u00a0Thus investment, \u2018I\u2019 is everything that remains of total expenditure after consumption, government spending, and net exports are subtracted (i.e. I = GDP \u2212 C \u2212 G \u2212 NX). [I corresponds to gross investment.]\n\nFactors affecting Investment\n\nInvestment is a function of Income and Rate of Interest [I=f(Y,r)]. Higher the income, the more will be the investment; higher the rate of interest the lesser will be the investment.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMore Income->More Savings->More Investment->More Income.\n\nAlso : No investment->No Growth->Poverty, Malnutrition, Unemployment etc.\n\nInvestment Models for UPSC Mains Exam :\n\nSo for more income, we need more investment. Which are the modes by which Investments can be attracted? Money for investing in productive assets can be from Public Sources (Government), Private Sources (Corporate) or Combined Sources (Public Private Partnership or PPP).\n\nThus one the basis of who invests in assets for increasing production, there are three major investment models.\n\nPublic Investment Model: For a government to invest, it needs revenue (mainly tax revenue), but the present tax revenues of India are not sufficient enough to meet the budgetary expenditure of India. So India cannot move ahead in the path of growth without private individuals; even for government to have a share in the investment, they need tax revenue from the private investors.\nPrivate Investment Model:\u00a0The private investment can come from India or abroad. If it\u2019s from abroad \u2013 they can be as FDI or FPI. (Details will be discussed later.) As India\u2019s Current Account Deficit is widening due to increased Oil Import, in this age of globalization, we cannot say NO to FDI or FPI.\u00a0Why private investment in India: For a country to grow and increase its income, the production has to be increased.\u00a0More goods and services has to be produced. Infrastructure to support production \u2013 transport, energy and communication \u2013 should also be developed.\u00a0But how can a nation with near 30% of population below poverty line, invest in production or infrastructure? Who has money to invest? Government?\nPublic Private Partnership Model: PPP means combining the best benefit from both public and private investments. Some of the Project Finance Schemes are as below:\n1. BOT (build\u2013operate\u2013transfer).\n2. BOOT (build\u2013own\u2013operate\u2013transfer).\n3. BOO (build\u2013own\u2013operate).\n4. BLT (build\u2013lease\u2013transfer).\n5. DBFO (design\u2013build\u2013finance\u2013operate).\n6. DBOT (design\u2013build\u2013operate\u2013transfer).\n7. DCMF (design\u2013construct\u2013manage\u2013finance).\n\nAgain, depending from where investment comes, there are two other investment models.\n\nDomestic Investment Model \u2013 It can be from Public, Private or PPP.\nForeign Investment Model \u2013 It can be 100% FDI or Foreign-Domestic Mix.\n\nAnd, depending on where the investment goes (or how investments are planned), there are various investment models. A few include:\n\nSector Specific Investment Models (In SEZ or MIZ etc).\nCluster Investment Model (Eg: Food Processing Industries)\nProject Finance Schemes and Finance Models : Understanding Models\n\nA road can be constructed by adopted different models. Let\u2019s analyze a few cases to understand the concept.\n\nCase 1: Government machinery and funds are directly used to construct a road. No\u00a0intermediaries\u00a0or third parties are involved. \u2014>Disadvantage: Government needs money to start the project.\nCase 2: A bid is placed for the road work contract. Usually a contractor or company with lowest bid gets the project. Government sanctions funds in part or full, depending upon the completion of stages.\nCase 3: Government spends no money from its pocket, but asks a company to construct the road. (No private firm will engage in constructing roads in a country unless they get returns for it \u2013 You know that!) Government offers to collect toll fees from the road for a fixed period of 10 or 15 years until they recover their cost and decent profit. \u2014> The benefit \u00a0of this approach is that without spending any amount from Government\u2019s pocket, the nation will get \u00a0a road. Toll charges in addition to tax paid is a matter of concern, but it\u2019s better than the case with no road or poor road with traffic congestion.\nInvestment Models in Relation With India\n\nHope it\u2019s clear by now that capital formation is necessary for any country to grow. But the process is not easy. The savings rate in India is now near 30%. Percapita Income of Indians is very low and hence the capital available for investing too is low. Investments should be studied from three angles \u2013 Households, Corporates and Government. Investments expect a return \u2013 be it from Government side or Private side. Though the return on investment in terms of profit or margin is the main motive behind investments, its effect on the welfare side and development should not be neglected. To add in the favorite terms of UPSC \u2013 investments should help in inclusive, sustainable development.\n\nDifferent Models of Investment and Planning related to India includes:\nHarrod Domar Model :\u00a0The model implies that economic growth depends on policies to increase investment, by increasing saving, and using that investment more efficiently through technological advances. It suggests that there is no natural reason for an economy to have balanced growth. It was more or less a One Sector Model. \u2014>Failed to attract investment on consumer goods in India as we lacked good capital goods industries.\nSolow Swan Model :\u00a0The neo-classical model was an extension to the 1946 Harrod\u2013Domar model that included a new term: productivity growth.\nFeldman\u2013Mahalanobis model :\u00a0\u00a0A high enough capacity in the capital goods sector in the long-run expands the capacity in the production of consumer goods.\u00a0Thus the essence of the model is a shift in the pattern of industrial investment towards building up a domestic consumption goods sector. It was a Two Sector Model which was later developed into Four Sector Model. Also known as Nehru-Mahalanobis model.\nRao ManMohan Model : Policy of Econmic Liberilization and FDI initiated in 1991 by Narasimha Rao and Dr.Manmohan Singh.\nLewis model of economic development by unlimited labour supply.\nInduced Investment Model.\nLeverage Investment Model.\nSaving led growth model. \u2014 Significance to India.\nDemand led growth model.\nConsumption led growth model.\nFactors affecting Investment Sentiments\nSavings Rate.\nTax Rate in the country. (Net income available after tax).\nInflation.\nRate of Interest in Banks.\nPossible Rate of Return on Capital.\nAvailability of other factors of production \u2013 cheap land, labour etc and supporting infrastructure \u2013 transport, energy and communication.\nMarket size and stability.\nInvestment friendly environment in the country (policies of the government).\nMock questions on Investment Models for UPSC Mains\nIndia\u2019s private-led overseas investment model has lessons for China.

    "[CONTENT] #594": "At the time of independence\u00a0of India, there was a large proportion of impoverished people in the country. Poverty alleviation and improvement of life standards of people were the major considerations of the government.\n\nIndian economy needed a direction, which was crippled by foreign subjugation. India was still a geographic expression and a nation in making. Other than the spirit of the freedom struggle, factors required for binding the people were few.\n\nSo the then politicians and think tanks opted for a planned economy and a centralized planning body to formulate a plan for socio-economic development. Thus, planning commission came into existence in March 1950 through a cabinet resolution which became a permanent body of experts.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAbout Planning Commission\nPlanning Commission of India (PC)\nFunctions and Responsibilities of the Planning Commission\nEvolution of Indian Planning\nPlanning Commission: Positives and Achievements\nPlanning Commission: Negatives and Problems\nWhy does India need a change from PC?\nAbout Planning Commission\n\nThe Planning Commission of India was set up by a Resolution of the Government of India in March 1950. Objectives of the government while starting PC were the following:\n\nPromote a rapid rise in the standard of living of the people by efficient exploitation of the resources of the country.\nIncrease production.\nOffer opportunities to all for employment in the service of the community.\nPlanning Commission of India (PC)\nPrime minister was the ex officio chairman of the planning commission assisted by a deputy chairman. It included 6 union cabinet ministers as its ex officio members. There was also a member secretary.\nThe planning commission was an autonomous body, which worked closely with union and state cabinets and had full knowledge of their policies. Institutionally it was a part of the cabinet organization and the \u2018demands for grants\u2019 for the PC was included in the budget for the cabinet secretariat.\nFunctions and Responsibilities of the Planning Commission\nMake\u00a0assessment of all resources of the country\nAugment\u00a0deficient resources\nFormulate\u00a0plans [Five Year Plans (FYP)] for the most effective and balanced utilization of resources and determining priorities.\nDetermine the stages of plan implementation\nDetermine the nature of machinery required.\nIndicate the factors which tend to retard economic developments.\nMonitor and evaluate.\nEvolution of Indian Planning\n\nThe first Five-year Plan was launched in 1951 and two subsequent five-year plans were formulated till 1965, when there was a break because of the Indo-Pakistan Conflict. Two successive years of drought, devaluation of the currency, a general rise in prices and erosion of resources disrupted the planning process and after three Annual Plans between 1966 and 1969, the fourth Five-year plan was started in 1969.\n\nThe Eighth Plan could not take off in 1990 due to the fast changing political situation at the Centre and the years 1990-91 and 1991-92 were treated as Annual Plans. The Eighth Plan was finally launched in 1992 after the initiation of structural adjustment policies.\n\nFor the first eight Plans the emphasis was on a growing public sector with massive investments in basic and heavy industries, but since the launch of the Ninth Plan in 1997, the emphasis on the public sector has become less pronounced and the current thinking on planning in the country, in general, is that it should increasingly be of an indicative nature.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPlanning Commission: Positives and Achievements\nPC laid emphasis on infrastructure developments and capacity building. As a result, huge investments were made in education, energy, industry, railways and irrigation.\nIndia became self-sufficient in agriculture and made great progress in capital sector goods and consumer sector goods.\nPC introduced many remarkable concepts like nationalisation, green revolution etc and transformed itself to align with new concepts like liberalisation, privatisation and inclusion.\nPlanning commission made great emphasis on social justice, governance, employment generation, poverty alleviation, health and skill development.\nThe transformation of India from a poor to an emerging economic power is credited to the orderly and phased manner in which planning was implemented.\nPlanning Commission: Negatives and Problems\n\nThere were many issues with planning methods followed in India. The drawbacks of the planning adopted via PC includes:\n\nNo structural mechanism for regular engagement with states.\nIneffective forum for the resolution of centre-state and inter-ministerial issues.\nInadequate capacity expertise and domain knowledge; weak networks with think tanks and lack of access to expertise outside government.\nFailed to implement land reforms.\nIt was a toothless body, was not able to make union/states/UTs answerable for not achieving the targets.\nDesigned plans with \u2018one size fit for all\u2019 approach. Hence, many plans failed to show tangible results.\nWeak implementation, monitoring and evaluation.\nWhy does India need a change from PC?\nThe contemporary world is governed by constitutional ethos like federalism rather than centralisation.\nIndias population has almost tripled to 121 Cr, and many of the Indian states are as big as European nations.\nIndian economy has expanded from a GDP of 10,000 crore to 100 lakh crore (at current prices) \u2013 ie. from a poor nation to one of the largest economies. India ranks 3rd in GDP at purchasing power parity, has surpassed Japan and is now standing just below the US and China. The new economy needs institutions which can take India forward in a global competitive environment.\nCo-operative federalism and fiscal federalism will help to meet the diverse needs of different states/UTs in which planning commission had failed drastically. Plans have to be formulated by fulfilling the aspirations of states by tailoring the plans to suit their needs and requirements.\nThe share of agriculture in GDP has been drastically decreasing\u00a0while the share of the service sector to GDP is increasing in India. From 1991, as our economy is liberalised, private firms have been playing a major role in the economy. Today we are living in a globalised world connected by modern transport, media, communications and networked international institutions and markets. With the increasing levels of development, the aspirations of people have soared from survival to safety and surplus. So governance systems need\u00a0to be transformed to keep up with the same.\nChange in the economic scenario where the government is supposed to be an enabler rather than a player or provider of first and last.

    "[CONTENT] #603": "The Central Plan amount is shrinking while Central Assistance is increasing \u2013 the 2014-15 budget paper analysis points to this fact. While the total plan expenditure has slightly increased this year (2014-15), the share for Central Plan is on a decrease while Central Assistance to state plans has increased. After the restructuring of Centrally Sponsored Schemes, the funding pattern of government too has changed.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Central Plan and Central Assistance to State Plans\nWhat was the split of the Plan Expenditure during last year (2013-14)?\nThe shrinking Central Plan!\nCentral Plan\nAdditional Central Assistance To State and UT Plans\nDifference between Central Sector Schemes and Centrally Sponsored Schemes\nCentral Sector Schemes\nCentrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS)\nAdditional Central Assistance Schemes\nThe Central Plan and Central Assistance to State Plans\n\nThe Indian Government expenditure can be broadly divided into two categories \u2013 Plan Expenditure and Non Plan Expenditure. Plan expenditure is as per the recommendations of Planning Commission as outlined in the Five Year Plans. The total plan expenditure (5.75 lakh crore in 2014-15) has two parts.\n\nCentral Plan Budget Support (2.36 lakh crore in 2014-15).\n(Additional) Central Assistance to State and UT Plans (3.38 lakh crore in 2014-15).\nCentral Plan and Central Assistance: The difference\n\nNB: From 2014-15 onwards, various Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) are part of Central Assistance. Earlier there were different heads like CSS, Additional Central Assistance etc.\n\nWhat was the split of the Plan Expenditure during last year (2013-14)?\n\nCentral Plan was Rs. 3.56 lakh crore and Central assistance to state plans had amounted to Rs. 1.19 trillion and out of total plan expenditure of Rs. 4.75 trillion in 2013-14 (RE).\n\nThe shrinking Central Plan!\n\nThe central plan outlay includes additional resources apart from the budget support (2.36 lakh crores in 2014-15). These additional resources come from IEBR of PE (Internal and external budgetary resources of public enterprises. (2.47 lakh crore for 2014-15). The total central plan outlay was decreased in the 2014-15 budget to cut the fiscal deficit, but Central assistance to states and UTs is on an increase.\n\nGovernment restructured the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) from BE 2014-15 (Plan). Accordingly,\n126 CSS have been restructured in 66 schemes which include 17 flagship programmes. In BE 2014-15, funds\u00a0have been provided under these schemes as Additional Central Assistance to State Plan. A much higher\u00a0allocation of \u00a0Rs. 3,38,408 crore in State Plan 2014-15 against BE 2013-14 of \u00a0Rs.1,36,254 crore reflects this change.\n\nCentral Plan\n\nThe central plan outlay goes to different sectors like:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEnergy.\nTransport.\nSocial Services.\nIndustry and minerals.\nGeneral economics services.\nCommunications.\nScience and Tech.\nAgriculture.\nGeneral Services.\nRural Development.\nIrrigation and flood control.\n\nMinistries which get major shares of Central plan are the following :\n\nMinistry of Petroleum and Natural gas.\nMinistry of Railways.\nMinistry of Power.\nMinistry of Road transport and highways.\n\nRemember that these are different from CSS which are connected with the central assistance given to states.\u00a0The states and UTs would now get 59 per cent of plan budget allocation, more than twice their share in FY14, whereas the share of Central Plan in plan account disbursement would drop from 75 per cent to 41 per cent.\n\nAdditional Central Assistance To State and UT Plans\n\nThe government restructured the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) from BE 2014-15 (Plan). Accordingly,\u00a0126 CSS have been restructured in 66 schemes which include 17 flagship programmes. In BE 2014-15, funds\u00a0have been provided under these schemes as Additional Central Assistance to State Plan. From 2014-15 Budget, fund allocation for almost all Centrally Sponsored Schemes like MGNEGA comes under the head Additional Central Assistance To States and UT Plans.\n\nNote: Planning Commission is governed by Gadgil-Mukherjee formula for normal central assistance.\u00a0The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula envisages that special category states get 30% of all central assistance. Of that, 90% is provided in grants and 10% in loans. For general category states, the ratio of grants to loans is 70:30.\n\nDifference between Central Sector Schemes and Centrally Sponsored Schemes\n\nBefore re-branding schemes into Central Plan and Additional Central Assistance to State Plans, there were mainly three classes of\u00a0schemes:\n\nCentral sector Scheme\nCentrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS)\nCentral Assistance Schemes \u2013 with many sub-categories like Normal Central Assistance(NCA), Special Central Assistance(SCA), Additional Central Assistance(ACA) etc.\nCentral Sector Schemes\n\nCentral sector schemes are 100% funded by the Union government and implemented by the Central Government machinery. Central sector schemes are mainly formulated on subjects from the Union List. Central Ministries may also implement some schemes directly in States/UTs, but resources under these Schemes are not generally transferred to States. (Fund from Union, implementation by union, list \u2013 union).\n\nEg: Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vyadyteekaran Yojana,\nRestructured-Accelerated Power\u00a0Development and Reform Programme\u00a0(R-APDRP).\n\nNB: For these Central Sector schemes, the funds are provided to the Implementing Agencies routed through REC and PFC to the State on a project level basis. Hence, these two schemes are classified under additional central assistance schemes too.\n\nCentrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS)\n\nUnder Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) a certain percentage of the funding is borne by the States in the ratio of 50:50, 70:30, 75:25 or 90:10 and the implementation is done by the State Governments. Centrally Sponsored Schemes are formulated in subjects from the State List. In case of CSS, the budgets are allocated under ministries concerned themselves and the entire process of release is also done by them. Funds are routed either through the consolidated fund of States and or are transferred directly to State/ District Level Autonomous Bodies/Implementing Agencies. (Fund from union and states, implementation by states, list \u2013 states).\n\nAdditional Central Assistance Schemes\n\nFund from union and states, implementation by states, list \u2013 union list or states. Examples of ACAs include:\n\nJawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM)\nAccelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP)\nNational Social Assistance Programme (NSAP)\nRashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY)\nRajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY)\nRestructured-Accelerated Power Development and Reform Programme (R-APDRP)\nBackward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF), of which there are (a) State Component (b) District Component\n\nNB:\u00a0For each new CSS/ACA/Flagship scheme, at least 25 percent of funds may be contributed by the General Category States and 10 percent of funds by the Special Category States including J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.\n\nUpdate (2015 Feb):\u00a0Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) now form a major part of the Central Assistance(CA) given by the center to states to implement the state plans. For ease of understanding CSS may now be treated synonymous to CA. There were other types of Central Assistance before 2015-16, but almost all of them are discontinued after the 14th Finance Commission recommendations for higher devolution taxes to states. As\u00a0states now get more revenue via higher devolution of central taxes, the Central Assistance to state plans has decreased. Refer Union Budget 2015-16 for latest figures.",

The Commission may also examine whether revenue deficit grants be provided at all.\n\nWhile making the recommendations, the XV-FC may consider\n\nResources of Central and State governments and their potential and fiscal capacity.\nDemand on the resources of respective governments.\nImpact of the enhanced devolution following 14th FC on the fiscal situation.\nImpact of GST and compensation for the losses in revenues for 5 years.\n\nThe Commission may consider proposing performance-based incentives to the States based on\n\nEfforts made in expansion and deepening of tax net under GST.\nEfforts and progress made in moving towards the replacement rate of population growth.\nAchievements in the implementation of flagship schemes of Government of India, disaster-resilient infrastructure, and sustainable development goals.\nProgress made in increasing capital expenditure, eliminating losses of the power sector, and improving the quality of such expenditure in generating future income streams.\nProgress made in increasing tax/non-tax revenues.\nPromoting savings by the adoption of Direct Benefit Transfers and Public Finance Management System.\nPromoting digital economy and removing layers between the government and the beneficiaries.\nProgress made in promoting ease of doing business and promoting labour-intensive growth.\nProvision of grants in aid to local bodies for basic services and implementation of a performance grant system in improving the delivery of services.\nControl or lack of it in incurring expenditure on populist measures.\nProgress made in sanitation, solid waste management and bringing in a behavioural change to end open defecation.\n\nThe Commission shall use the population data of 2011 while making its recommendations.\n\nThe Commission may review the present arrangements on financing Disaster Management initiatives regarding the funds constituted under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.\n\nControversies associated with the 15th Finance Commission\n\nThe Terms of Reference (ToR) of the 15th Finance Commission were opposed by some States. The main apprehensions were:\n\nProgressive states would lose heavily if the population-based on the 2011 census was considered for the devolution of central funds.\nStates that have performed well on population control would be penalized.\nPrevious FCs used 1971 Census numbers while the 14th commission had given weight to both the 1971 (17.5%) and 2011 (10%) censuses.\nSome states have a higher potential in expanding the GST tax base while others do not. Hence the performance on this parameter cannot be a basis for fund devolution.\nMany states run social sector schemes which are welfare-oriented. If these schemes are considered populist, these States will be penalized.\nStates are already under the burden of GST and devolution based on the 2011 Census will further constrain the fund position of the States.\nStates resent a devolution criterion that considers the implementation of Central schemes, as tax devolution is their constitutional right and not a largesse of the Central government.\nSince revenue deficit grants are proposed to be re-looked, there may be a reduction in the fiscal autonomy of the States and conditions for borrowing from external sources will also be reviewed.\n\nThese apprehensions were addressed by the Centre which said that there is no regional bias and that poorer States rely more on Centre\u2019s revenue than developed ones. Regarding the shift to Census 2011 numbers, it was mentioned that efforts made towards reducing population growth rate towards replacement rate were also included which balances the equation.\n\nRecommendations of the 15th Finance Commission\n\nThe 15th Finance Commission proposed recommendations for both vertical and horizontal devolution.\n\nVertical Devolution\n\n41% of the divisible pool to be devolved to the States in the year 2020-21.\n\nFC-XIV which had recommended 42%, had a view that tax devolution should be the primary route of transfer of resources to States as they are a more objective form of transfer of resources as compared to other forms. The XV-FC also agrees with this view but reduced the States\u2019 share to 41% because of the re-organization of the State of Jammu & Kashmir into UTs of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir through the Jammu & Kashmir Re-organization Act, 2019.\n\nUTs are the responsibilities of the Union and their demands have to be met from the Union Government\u2019s resources.\n\nHorizontal Devolution\n\nHorizontal devolution is done primarily to enable the States to provide basic public goods and services with equivalent tax effort. The various criteria to be considered for horizontal devolution are classified into three broad groups as follows.\n\nNeed-based criteria: Population, area and forest & ecology form the need-based criteria. This is needed to address the fiscal gap of States existing due to the structural mismatch between the States\u2019 resources and their expenditure liabilities.\nEquity-based criterion: Income distance forms the equity-based criterion to ensure fiscal equalization given the large differences in the resource base available and status of development within the country.\nPerformance-based criteria: Demographic performance and tax effort are part of the performance-based criteria that is framed to reward and incentivize States to perform better, in terms of utilization of resources available to them.\n\nTable 1 Horizontal Devolution Criteria\n\nCriteria\n\t\n14th\u00a0FC\n\t\n15th\u00a0FC\n\n\nIncome Distance\n\t\n50.0\n\t\n45.0\n\n\nPopulation of 1971\n\t\n17.5\n\t\n\u2013\n\n\nPopulation of 2011\n\t\n10.0\n\t\n15.0\n\n\nArea\n\t\n15.0\n\t\n15.0\n\n\nForest Cover\n\t\n7.5\n\t\n\u2013\n\n\nForest & Ecology\n\t\n\u2013\n\t\n10.0\n\n\nDemographic Performance\n\t\n\u2013\n\t\n12.5\n\n\nTax Effort\n\t\n\u2013\n\t\n2.5\n\n\nTotal\n\t\n100\n\t\n100\nPopulation: Only 2011 Census numbers are used as per the ToR. Population criterion is assigned a weight of only 15 per cent as some of the other criteria will also be scaled by it.\nArea: A moderate weight of 15 per cent for the area criterion is assigned larger area incurs some additional administrative costs but it may not lead to a proportional increase in the cost of providing services.\nForest and Ecology: This criterion is for the ecological services being provided by a State\u2019s forest cover to the country as a whole and is arrived at by calculating the share of the dense forest of each State in the aggregate dense forest of all the States. A weight of 10 per cent is assigned for the forest and ecology criterion.\nIncome Distance: Distance of per capita income is the criteria used to make the devolution formula more equalizing and progressive, and provides higher devolution to States with lower per capita income and lower own tax capacity. The XV-FC retained the income distance criterion with a weight of 45 per cent.\nDemographic Performance: An abrupt change from 1971 Census data to 2011 Census data should not unfairly penalize some States which have performed well on population control. Hence, the commission recommended introducing a new performance-based criterion to reward States who have performed well on the demography front. This criterion of demographic performance is computed by using the reciprocal of TFR of each State, scaled by the population data of Census 1971. States which have achieved lower TFR will be scored higher and vice versa. This criterion is assigned a weight of 12.5 per cent.\nTax Effort: The inclusion of tax effort as a performance-based criterion will reward the States with higher tax collection efficiency and encourage all States to be more tax efficient. It is computed by taking the ratio of the average of per capita own tax revenue of a State over three years and its per capita GSDP and scaling this ratio by the population of the State. Total weight of 2.5 per cent has been assigned to this criterion.\n\nUttar Pradesh and Bihar have received the largest devolutions for 2020-21 while Karnataka and Kerala saw the largest decreases in the share of the divisible pool.\n\nGrants in Aid\n\nRevenue Deficit Grants: 14 states are estimated to face a revenue deficit post-devolution. \u00a0The Commission has recommended revenue deficit grants worth Rs 74,341 crore to these 14 states. \u00a0Furthermore, the three states of Karnataka, Mizoram, and Telangana received special grants to make up the shortfall between untied transfers received by these States in the form of tax devolution plus revenue deficit grant in 2020-21 vis-a-vis the corresponding amount in 2019-20.\n\nSectoral Grants: The XV-FC is considering recommending sectoral grants for nutrition, health, pre-primary education, judiciary, rural connectivity, railways, statistics and police training, and housing during its tenure. Of these, grants for nutrition, to augment the efforts of the States towards reducing and ultimately eliminating malnutrition, is specifically recommended even in 2020-21.\n\nPerformance-based Incentives: Six broad areas are identified to provide performance-based incentives to States.\n\nImplementation of Agriculture Reforms\nDevelopment of Aspirational Districts and Aspirational Blocks\nPower Sector Reforms\nEnhancing Trade including Exports\nIncentives for Education\nPromotion of Domestic and International Tourism\nEmpowering Local Bodies\n\nSome significant changes made by XV-FC compared to previous Finance Commissions:\n\nTo recommend grants to all tiers of the Panchayati Raj to enable pooling of resources to create durable community assets and improve their functional viability.\nTo give grants to the Fifth and Sixth Schedule areas and Cantonment Boards.\nTo provide for tied grants in the critical sectors of sanitation and drinking water to ensure additional funds to the local bodies over and above the funds allocated for these purposes under the centrally sponsored schemes (CSS), Swachh Bharat and Jal Jeevan Missions.\nTo account for increasing urbanization the share of urban local bodies in Finance Commission grants to local bodies should be gradually increased to 40 per cent over the medium term.\nSince larger cities will tend to grow faster with the agglomeration effect, the fifty Million-Plus cities in the country need differentiated treatment, with special emphasis on meeting the challenges of bad ambient air quality, groundwater depletion and sanitation.\n\nGrants to Local Bodies:\n\nThe Commission has recommended a total of Rs 90,000 crore for grants to the local bodies in 2020-21.\nThis amounts to 4.31% of the divisible pool.\nThese grants will be made available to all three tiers of Panchayat- village, block, and district.\nThe inter-se distribution of grants for local bodies among the States may be based on population and area in the ratio of 90:10.\nFor 2020-21, the proportion of grants between rural and urban local bodies recommended by the XV-FC is in the ratio of 67.5:32.5.\nFor all urban bodies, the distribution of grants for 2020-21 is based on population.\nDisaster Risk Management\nTo promote local-level mitigation activities, mitigation funds shall be set up at both national and state levels in the form of NDMF and State Disaster Mitigation Funds (SDMF), following the Disaster Management Act.\nThe Commission recommended the creation of funds for disaster mitigation along with disaster response, which will now together be called as National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF) and State Disaster Risk Management Funds (SDRMF).\nRecommended grants for the State Disaster Risk Management Fund is Rs 28,983 crore. Out of this, the share of SDRF shall be 80 per cent and the share of SDMF 20 per cent. The allocation for the National Disaster Risk Management Fund is Rs 12,390 crore.\nAllocations for NDRF / SDRF will be further sub-divided into\nResponse and Relief \u2013 40 per cent\nRecovery and Reconstruction \u2013 30 per cent\nCapacity Building \u2013 10 per cent\nConclusion\n\nSeveral challenges have emerged since these recommendations were made by the XV-FC in the form of the global economic slowdown, lower tax revenue realization and above all, the enormous disruption to the economy created by the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThese will necessitate several additional demands for allocations to be made in the coming years.\n\nFurther, several policy issues like streamlining GST, Direct Tax Code, improving expenditure outcomes, etc. will need special focus from the government to achieve the noble objectives set before the Finance Commission.",

We have already\u00a0covered the major programs under Central Plan in a separate article.\n\nUpdate:\u00a0To learn the Centrally Sponsored Schemes and Central Sector Schemes as mentioned in the Union Budget 2018, refer this post.\n\nThis post is dedicated entirely to list the major programs under the Central Assistance for States and UT plans. It should be noted that Centrally Sponsored Schemes(CSS) forms a major chunk of the Central Assistance for State and UT plans. In that sense this article is also about the latest Centrally Sponsored Schemes.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Centrally Sponsored Schemes(CSS)?\nBudget allocation to CSS\nList of the Centrally Sponsored Schemes\nSchemes to be fully supported by Union Government\nSchemes to be run with the Changed Sharing Pattern\nSchemes delinked from support of the Centre\nWhy are some CSS de-linked from Center\u2019s support?\nWhy there are still CSS?\nFinance Commission and Recommendations\nReference:\nWhat are Centrally Sponsored Schemes(CSS)?\n\nUsually, Center can run schemes only on subjects mentioned in Union list (Central Plan/Central Sector Schemes). It\u2019s the duty of the states to implement programmes on items mentioned in the State list. But to encourage states to take up projects and programmes in the national interest, Center sponsors fully or partially many programmes on items mentioned in State list. These programs are called Centrally Sponsored Schemes.\n\nTo be precise,\u00a0CSS is the biggest component of Central Assistance to state plans(CA), where states don\u2019t have much flexibility. The other component \u2013 block grants to states \u2013 is a grant and states have full flexibility in utilizing. But in the Budget 2015, many of the plan grants(block grants) like\u00a0Normal Central Assistance, Special Plan Assistance, Special Central Assistance and Additional Central Assistance for other purposes are subsumed in the award of FC itself (greater share of taxes and non-plan grants). Thus, though considered as two separate entities before, Centrally Sponsored Schemes(CSS)\u00a0now being the major part of Central Assistance (CA) to states, the terms CSS and CA are often used interchangeably.\n\nBudget allocation to CSS\nNITI Aayog\u2019s Arvind Panagariya recommends reducing CSS\n\nAs per the\u00a0Union Budet 2015-16, the total Plan Outlay for 2015-16 is Rs. 4,65,277 crore.\u00a0The Budgetary support for Central Plan in 2014-15 is Rs.2,60,493 crore\u00a0while the total central assistance for\u00a0State and Union Territory Plans is Rs.2,04,784 crore. It should be noted that while the budgetary support for Central Plan has increased, the central assistance to state plans has decreased this year.\n\nList of the Centrally Sponsored Schemes\n\nAt present, there are 72 CSS, including six new\u00a0schemes introduced by the NDA government. Budget 2015-16 mentions about bringing down the number of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) in tune with the higher allocation for states as per 14th Finance Commission recommendations. Now there are only 31 schemes fully supported by Union Government and 24 schemes under partial support. 8 schemes are de-linked from center\u2019s support.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSchemes to be fully supported by Union Government\n\n1.

Impact Assessment Studies of AIBFMP\n\nNote: The Centre-State funding pattern is being modified in view of the larger devolution of tax resources to States as per the recommendations of 14th Finance Commission whereby in this scheme, the revenue expenditure is to be borne by the States. Subsequent to changed funding pattern, overall expenditure on the schemes will not decrease.\n\nSchemes delinked from support of the Centre\n\n1. National e-Governance Plan\n2. Backward Regions Grant Funds\n3. Modernisation of Police Forces\n4. Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyaan (RGPSA)\n5. Scheme for Central Assistance to the States for developing export infrastructure\n6. Scheme for setting up of 6000 Model Schools\n7. National Mission on Food Processing\n8. Tourist Infrastructure\n\nWhy are some CSS de-linked from Center\u2019s support?\n\nAs states are now given more direct funds which offer greater flexibility (extra to regular CSS), there is no need for additional spending through the CSS route by the Center.\n\nWhy there are still CSS?\n\nIdeally, all CSS should go. Funds should flow to states without pre-conditions to ensure greater flexibility. The center will save on inter-mediation costs and in the long term, there would also be higher implementation efficiency in terms of outcome yields on every rupee spent. But there are still Centrally Sponsored Schemes running on state subjects. The reasons are the following:\n\nKeeping in mind that some of these schemes represent national priorities especially those targeted at poverty alleviation, Centre has decided that it will continue to contribute to such schemes.\nThe schemes mandated by legal obligations and those backed by Cess collection have been fully provided for.\nFinance Commission and Recommendations\n\nFinance commission(FC) recommended 42 percent of Union Tax as share to states (vertical devolution). But will FC deal with the\u00a0split the 42 percent tax share among different states (horizonatal distribution)? Shouldn\u2019t the BIMARU states get more money than the prosperous states? Who takes care of this? If you are not sure, please see our next article which discuss the Center-State financial relations.\n\nThe objective of 14th FC has been to fill the resource gaps of each State to the extent possible through tax devolution.\nFC believe that while there are certain common factors that impact cost disability and fiscal capacity of States, there exist circumstances that are unique to individual States.\nFFC did not make a distinction between special and general category states in determining their norms and recommendations.\nHowever, FC have provided post-devolution revenue deficit grants for States where devolution alone could not cover the assessed gap.\nHence, Normal Central Assistance, Special Plan Assistance, Special Central Assistance and Additional Central Assistance for other purposes are subsumed in the award itself.\nREFERENCE:\nIndiabuget.nic.in \u2013 Budget at a glance 5\nIndiabuget.nic.in \u2013 Budget at a glance\u00a07\nIndiabuget.nic.in \u2013 Budget at a glance\u00a08\nIndiabuget.nic.in \u2013 Budget at a glance\u00a010",

The mainly cover items listed in states list.\n\nCentrally Sponsored Schemes vs Central Assistance\n\nCentrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) now form a major part of the Central Assistance(CA) given by the centre to states to implement the state plans. For ease of understanding, CSS may now be treated synonymously to CA.\n\nThere were other types of Central Assistance before 2015-16, but almost all of them are discontinued as states got higher revenue after the 14th Finance Commission recommendations (higher devolution of taxes to states).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRestructuring of Centrally Sponsored Schemes \u2013 Chaturvedi Committee Recommendations (2014)\n\nIn 2014, the UPA-2 government approved Planning Commission\u2019s proposal to merge the 147 Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and bring it down to 66 across various sectors for effective implementation and monitoring of the 12th Five Year Plan.\u00a0The merger proposal was in line with the recommendations of the Chaturvedi committee, which had suggested bringing down CSS to avoid overlap.\n\nCSS, Flagship Schemes and ACA: CSSs are\u00a0backed by Central government grant money. They\u00a0have been implemented by State governments over at least ten Five Year Plans. Out of the Centrally sponsored schemes, Government gives priority to certain special schemes to achieve social objectives. These schemes are called Flagship schemes. Schemes covered under additional central assistance are known as ACA.\n\nConceptually both CSS and Additional Central Assistance (ACA) Schemes have been passed by the Central Government to the State governments. The difference between the two has arisen because of the historical evolution and the way these are being budgeted and controlled and release of funds takes place. In case of CSS, the budgets are allocated under ministries concerned themselves and the entire process of release is also done by them.\n\nCentrally Sponsored Schemes and Flagship Schemes during UPA-2 regime\n\nTowards the end of the UPA-2 rule (after restructuring), there were 66 Centrally Sponsored Schemes. 17 schemes out of the 66 schemes were called Flagship schemes. Flagship schemes correspond to a few major schemes, with higher fund allocation and rigorously pursued by the Government to achieve its national objectives.\n\nPlease see below the list of 66 Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) including the 17 flagship schemes.\n\n66 Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) including the 17 flagship schemes: UPA-2 regime\nJawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) *.\nAccelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) *.\nNational Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) *.\nRashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) *.\nRajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) *.

ClearIAS.com will provide detailed overview and analysis of the important individual schemes in the coming articles.\n\nWhat is the significance of Article 282?\n\nArticle 282. Expenditure defrayable by the Union or a State out of its revenues:\u00a0The Union or a State may make any grants for any public purpose, notwithstanding that the purpose is not one with respect to which Parliament or the Legislature of the State, as the case may be, may make laws.\n\nCriticism of Centrally Sponsored Schemes\nCSS dictate Centers\u2019 agenda and priorities which may not be relevant for states.\nCSS offers little flexibility for the states.\nNeeds of states differ among themselves and a universal CSS package may not be practical in all cases.\nMany CSS which offers only partial support from Center may impose a burden on states.\nHow important is CSS for UPSC Exams?\n\nCSS are an important area for Prelims and Mains. UPSC aspirants should keep in mind that there are still many schemes outside the scope of CSS like Central Sector Schemes. The government in coming months may announce new schemes as they did with\u00a0RKSK. Aspirants are also advised to keep track of merging or renaming of schemes.\n\nFor example, National Rural livelihood Mission was renamed as Aajivika. Also, National Rural Health Mission and National Urban Health Mission were merged together and renamed as National Health Mission. Any scheme can be handpicked to frame a question. See related questions the\u00a02013 Mains question paper\u00a0for reference:\n\nThe concept of Mid-Day Meal (MDM) scheme is almost a century old in India with early beginnings in Madras Presidency in pre-independent India. The scheme has again been given impetus in most states in the last two decades. Critically examine its twin objectives, latest mandates and success.\nThe Central Government frequently complains on the poor performance of the State Governments in eradicating suffering of the vulnerable sections of the society. Restructuring of Centrally sponsored schemes across the sectors for ameliorating the cause of vulnerable sections of population aims at providing flexibility to the States in better implementation.

    "[CONTENT] #621": "Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) on January 7, 2014.\n\nThe programme will comprehensively address the health needs of the\u00a0near 25 crore adolescents, who account for over 21% of the country\u2019s population. RKSK\u00a0will include a sharp focus on adolescents\u2019 sexual health.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWho is an adolescent?\nWhat\u2019s new about the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK)?\nWho is an adolescent?\n\nThe RKSK programme defines an adolescent as a person within 10-19 years of age, in urban and rural areas, includes both girls and boys, married and unmarried, poor and affluent, whether they are in school or out of school.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK)?\n\nThere were 147 Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) till 2013 budget. (Yes, much to the dismay of UPSC aspirants; they had to by-heart so many Yojanas and Karykrams!) But Planning Commission has recently announced merging of many CSS to a manageable number (ie. 66), for ease of government officials like District Collectors (and for UPSC aspirants too :-)). But then, why another Karyakram now? Let\u2019s see what is new about RKSK?\n\nThe Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) will bring in several new dimensions, such as \u2013 mental health, nutrition, substance misuse, gender based violence and non-communicable diseases.\nThe programme introduces community based interventions through peer educators, and is underpinned by collaborations with other Ministries and State governments, knowledge partners and more research.\nNew focus on adolescents is in recognition of the fact that without adolescent health, maternal and child health outcomes may continue to elude us.\nAt present the Government\u2019s strategic approach in health sector is RMNCH+A\u00a0(Reproductive, Maternal, New born, Child Health + Adolescent) in which \u2018A\u2019 denotes adolescents.\n5 by 5 RMNCH+A matrix has been developed which lists out the 5 high impact interventions under each of the 5 pillars, all of which need to be implemented together, at the same time, with high coverage and quality.\nThe programme is an effort to move away from a \u2018doctor-driven\u2019 effort towards a holistic and participative programme.\nThe RKSK recognizes that all adolescents need attention even before the occurrence of any disease or problem, and in order to make informed decisions and choices.\nAdolescents present a unique opportunity to reap the country\u2019s demographic dividends.\nLifestyle and behavior related diseases such as substance abuse, inflicting self harm, tendency towards gender-based violence, low nutrition and physical inactivity, which begin and occur more during this phase, are fast becoming the causes for the highest mortality in this age group.\nThe programme emphasis seven \u2018Cs\u201d- coverage, content, communication, counselling, clinics and convergence.\nActive use of new technologies and social media platforms will form an integral part of the programme to reach the adolescents in their own spaces, with strategic partnerships with communities and peers.",

It deals in financial instruments (like bills of exchange, shares, debentures, bonds, etc).\nFund Raising By Business Units\n\nBusiness units have to raise short-term as well as long-term funds\u00a0to meet their working and fixed capital requirements from time to time.

So, we find two\u00a0different groups, one who invest money or lend money and the others, who borrow or use\u00a0the money.\n\nMain functions of financial market\n\nLet us now see the main functions of financial market.\n(a) It provides facilities for interaction between the investors and the borrowers.\n(b) It provides pricing information resulting from the interaction between buyers and sellers\u00a0in the market when they trade the financial assets.\n(c) It provides security to dealings in financial assets.\n(d) It ensures liquidity by providing a mechanism for an investor to sell the financial assets.\n(e) It ensures low cost of transactions and information.\n\nClassification of Financial Market\n\nA financial market consists of two major segments: (a) Money Market; and (b) Capital\u00a0Market. While the money market deals in short-term credit, the capital market handles\u00a0the medium term and long-term credit.\n\nFinancial Market Classification\nMONEY MARKET.\nCall Money.\nTreasury Bill.\nCommercial Paper.\nCertificate of Deposit.\nTrade bill.\nCAPITAL MARKET.\nSecurities Market\nPrimary Market : IPOs, Book Building, Private Placements.\nSecondary Market : Equity Market, Debt Market, Commodity Market, Futures and Options Market. (Secondary Market can be basically divided into two \u2013 spot market and forward market. Forward market has two divisions \u2013 futures and options/derivatives. Again, there are two types of options \u2013 put option and call option.)\nNon-Securities Market\nMutual Funds.\nFixed Deposits, Savings Deposits, Post Office savings.\nInsurance.\nMoney Market\n\nThe money market is a market for short-term funds, which deals in financial assets whose\u00a0period of maturity is upto one year. It should be noted that money market does not deal in\u00a0cash or money as such but simply provides a market for credit instruments such as bills of\u00a0exchange, promissory notes, commercial paper, treasury bills, etc. These financial\u00a0instruments are close substitute of money. These instruments help the business units, other\u00a0organisations and the Government to borrow the funds to meet their short-term requirement.\n\nThe Indian money market consists\u00a0of Reserve Bank of India, Commercial banks, Co-operative banks, and other specialised\u00a0financial institutions. The Reserve Bank of India is the leader of the money market in India.\u00a0Some Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and financial institutions like LIC,\u00a0GIC, UTI, etc. also operate in the Indian money market.\n\nTo read more click here.\n\nCapital Market\nCapital Market is an institutional arrangement for borrowing medium and long-term funds and which provides facilities for marketing and trading of securities. So it constitutes all long-term borrowings from banks and financial institutions, borrowings from foreign markets and raising of capital by issue various securities such as shares, debentures, bonds, etc. The securities market has two different segments namely primary and secondary market.\nTo read more click here.\nPrimary Market vs Secondary Market : The primary market consists of arrangements for procurement of long-term funds by companies by fresh issue of shares and debentures. The secondary market or stock exchange provides a ready market for existing long term securities. Stock exchange is the secondary market, which provides a place for regular sale and purchase of different types of securities like shares, debentures, bonds & government securities. It is an organised market where all transactions are regulated by the rules and laws of the concerned stock exchanges.\nSecondary Markets or Stock Exchanges : The functions of a stock exchanges are to provide ready and continuous market for securities, information about prices and sales, safety to dealings and investment, helps mobilisation of savings and capital formation. It acts as a barometer of economic and business conditions and helps in better allocation of funds. Stock exchanges provide many benefits to companies, investors and the society as a whole.\nBut they also suffer from limitations like exclusive speculation and fluctuation in prices due to rumours and unpredictable events. There are 21 stock exchanges in India presently, including BSE, NSE and OTCEI. Stock Exchanges are regulated by the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act and by SEBI. SEBI has initiated a number of reforms in the primary and secondary market to regulate the stock market. Documentary and procedural requirements for listing and trading have been made stricter and foolproof to protect investors\u2019 interest.\nThe secondary market has further two components.\u00a0First, the spot market where securities are traded for immediate delivery and payment.\u00a0The other is forward market where the securities are traded for future delivery and\u00a0payment. This forward market is further divided into Futures and Options Market (Derivatives\u00a0Markets).\nIn futures Market the securities are traded for conditional future delivery whereas in\u00a0option market, two types of options are traded. A put option gives right but not an\u00a0obligation to the owner to sell a security to the writer of the option at a predetermined\u00a0price before a certain date, while a call option gives right but not an obligation to\u00a0the buyer to purchase a security from the writer of the option at a particular price\u00a0before a certain date.\nMoney Market and Capital Market : A comparison\nPoint of Distinction\n\t\nMoney Market\n\t\nCapital Market\n\n\n1.

They are Call Money, Treasury Bill, Commercial Paper, Certificate of Deposit and Trade bill.\n\nBefore understanding the various instruments of Money Market in detail, it would be better if we start with the differences between Bill of exchange and Promissory Note.\n\nThese are two basic concepts, related with the instruments in money market.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDifference Between Bill of exchange and Promissory note\nBill of exchange\nPromissory Note\nImportant Money Market Instruments or Securities\nCall Money\nTreasury Bill\nCommercial Paper\nCertificate of Deposit\nTrade Bill\nDifference Between Bill of exchange and Promissory note\n\nBills of exchange and promissory notes are written commitments between two parties that confirm a financial transaction has been agreed upon. Below is the detailed concept of both terms.\n\nBill of exchange\n\nA bill of exchange is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order,\u00a0signed by the maker, directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money only\u00a0to or to the order of a certain person, or to the bearer of the instrument.\u00a0In a bill of exchange there are three parties the drawer, the drawee and the payee.\n\nPromissory Note\n\nA promissory note is an instrument in writing (not being a bank note or a currency\u00a0note) containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker, to pay a certain\u00a0sum of money only to or to the order of a certain person or to the bearer of the\u00a0instrument.\u00a0In a promissory note there are two parties the maker of the note and the payee.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNB :\u00a0In a promissory note there is a promise to make the payment whereas in a bill of exchange there is an order for making the payment. Also, a\u00a0promissory note requires no acceptance as it is signed by the person who is liable to pay. The drawer of a bill of exchange is generally the creditor of the drawee and therefore it must be accepted by the drawee before it can be presented for payment.\n\nImportant Money Market Instruments or Securities\n\nThere are various securities in Money Market as well as in Capital Market. Following are some of the important money market instruments or securities :\n\nCall Money\n\nCall money is mainly used by the banks to meet their temporary\u00a0requirement of cash. They borrow and lend money from each other normally on a\u00a0daily basis. It is repayable on demand and its maturity period varies in between one\u00a0day to a fortnight. The rate of interest paid on call money loan is known as call rate.\n\nTreasury Bill\n\nA treasury bill is a promissory note issued by the RBI to meet the\u00a0short-term requirement of funds. Treasury bills are highly liquid instruments, that means,\u00a0at any time the holder of treasury bills can transfer of or get it discounted from RBI.\u00a0These bills are normally issued at a price less than their face value; and redeemed at\u00a0face value. So the difference between the issue price and the face value of the treasury\u00a0bill represents the interest on the investment. These bills are secured instruments and\u00a0are issued for a period of not exceeding 364 days. Banks, Financial institutions and\u00a0corporations normally play major role in the Treasury bill market.\n\nCommercial Paper\n\nCommercial paper (CP) is a popular instrument for financing\u00a0working capital requirements of companies. The CP is an unsecured instrument issued\u00a0in the form of promissory note. This instrument was introduced in 1990 to enable the\u00a0corporate borrowers to raise short-term funds. It can be issued for period ranging\u00a0from 15 days to one year. Commercial papers are transferable by endorsement and\u00a0delivery. The highly reputed companies (Blue Chip companies) are the major player\u00a0of commercial paper market.\n\nCertificate of Deposit\n\nCertificate of Deposit (CDs) are short-term instruments\u00a0issued by Commercial Banks and Special Financial Institutions (SFIs), which are\u00a0freely transferable from one party to another. The maturity period of CDs ranges\u00a0from 91 days to one year. These can be issued to individuals, co-operatives and\u00a0companies.\n\nTrade Bill\n\nNormally the traders buy goods from the wholesalers or manufactures on\u00a0credit. The sellers get payment after the end of the credit period. But if any seller\u00a0does not want to wait or in immediate need of money he/she can draw a bill of\u00a0exchange in favour of the buyer. When buyer accepts the bill it becomes a negotiable\u00a0instrument and is termed as bill of exchange or trade bill. This trade bill can now be\u00a0discounted with a bank before its maturity. On maturity the bank gets the payment\u00a0from the drawee i.e., the buyer of goods. When trade bills are accepted by Commercial\u00a0Banks it is known as Commercial Bills. So trade bill is an instrument, which enables\u00a0the drawer of the bill to get funds for short period to meet the working capital needs.\n\nAlso read about Capital market.\n\nReferences : NOS and CBSE.",

Capital market embraces all forms of lending and borrowing, whether or not evidenced by the creation of a negotiable financial instrument. It has two components, the securities market and non-securities market.\n\nWe have seen that there are lot many securities exist in money market. Similarly, securities exist in Capital Market too. The market where securities are traded known as Securities market. The Securities Market refers to the markets for those financial instruments/ claims/obligations that are commonly and readily transferable by sale. The Securities Market has two interdependent and inseparable segments, the new issues (primary) market and the stock (secondary) market.\n\nAlso read: US Debt Ceiling Crisis and US Federal Government Shut down Explained\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDebt Market vs Derivative Market vs Commodity Market vs Equity Market\n\nNow let\u2019s have a quick look at the various markets and the instruments/securities associated with each.\n\n1. Debt Market\n\nThe Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) segment of the National Stock Exchange provides a trading platform for a wide range of fixed income securities that includes central government securities, treasury bills (T-bills), state development loans (SDLs), bonds issued by public sector undertakings (PSUs), floating-rate bonds (FRBs), zero-coupon bonds (ZCBs), index bonds, commercial papers (CPs), certificates of deposit (CDs), corporate debentures, SLR and non-SLR bonds issued by financial institutions (FIs), bonds issued by foreign institutions and units of mutual funds (MFs). (This means that debt market deals not only with capital market securities but also with money market securities).\n\nDebt Instruments: Debt instrument represents a contract whereby one party lends\u00a0money to another on pre-determined terms with regards to rate and\u00a0periodicity of interest, repayment of principal amount by the borrower\u00a0to the lender. Bonds and debentures are the major debt instruments.\n\nBonds and Debentures as debt instruments:\u00a0A Bond is a loan given by the buyer to the issuer of the instrument. Companies, financial institutions, or even the government can issue bonds. Over and above the scheduled interest payments as and when applicable, the holder of a bond is entitled to receive the par value of the instrument at the specified maturity date. Bonds can be broadly classified into Tax-Saving Bonds Regular Income Bonds. Also, note the below points which explain the difference between bonds and debentures.\n\nDebentures are bonds which have no collateral.\nBonds are more secure than debentures, but the rate of interest is lower.\nDebentures are unsecured loans but carry a higher rate of interest.\nIn bankruptcy, bondholders are paid first, but liability towards debenture holders is less.\nDebenture holders get periodical interest.\nBond holders receive accrued payment upon completion of the term.\nIn the Indian securities markets, the term \u2018bond\u2019 is used\u00a0for debt instruments issued by the Central and State governments\u00a0and public sector organizations and the term \u2018debenture\u2019 is used for\u00a0instruments issued by private corporate sector.\n2. Derivative Market [Financial Derivatives + Commodity Derivatives]\n\nDerivative is a product whose value is derived from the value of one or more basic\u00a0variables, called bases (underlying asset, index, or reference rate), in a contractual manner.\u00a0The underlying asset can be equity, forex, commodity or any other asset. For example,\u00a0wheat farmers may wish to sell their harvest at a future date to eliminate the risk of\u00a0a change in prices by that date. Such a transaction is an example of a derivative. The\u00a0price of this derivative is driven by the spot price of wheat which is the \u201cunderlying\u201d. Derivatives are securities under the SC(R)A and hence the trading of derivatives is governed\u00a0by the regulatory framework under the SC(R)A. In the Indian context the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SC(R)A) defines\u00a0\u201cderivative\u201d to include \u2013\n\nA security derived from a debt instrument, share, loan whether secured or unsecured,\u00a0risk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security.\nA contract, which derives its value from the prices, or index of prices, of underlying\u00a0securities.\nDerivative products initially emerged as hedging devices against\u00a0fluctuations in commodity prices and commodity-linked derivatives\u00a0remained the sole form of such products for almost three hundred\u00a0years. The financial derivatives came into spotlight in post-1970\u00a0period due to growing instability in the financial markets. However,\u00a0since their emergence, these products have become very popular and\u00a0by 1990s, they accounted for about two thirds of total transactions in\u00a0derivative products.\nThe following three broad categories of participants \u2013 hedgers,\u00a0speculators, and arbitrageurs trade in the derivatives market.\nDerivative contracts have several variants. The most common variants are forwards, futures,\u00a0options and swaps.\nDERIVATIVE CONTRACT INSTRUMENTS\nForwards: A forward contract is a customized contract between two entities, where settlement takes place on a specific date in the future at today\u2019s pre-agreed price.\nFutures: A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future at a certain price. Futures contracts are special types of forward contracts in the sense that the former are standardized exchange traded contracts.\nOptions: Options are of two types \u2013 calls and puts. Calls give the buyer the right\u00a0but not the obligation to buy a given quantity of the underlying asset, at a given price on or before a given future date. Puts give the buyer the right, but not the obligation to sell a given quantity of the underlying asset at a given price on or before a given date.\nWarrants: Options generally have lives of up to one year, the majority of options traded on options exchanges having a maximum maturity of nine months. Longer dated options are called warrants and are generally traded over-the-counter.\nLEAPS: The acronym LEAPS means Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities. These are options having a maturity of up to three years.\nBaskets: Basket options are options on portfolios of underlying assets. The underlying asset is usually a moving average or a basket of assets. Equity index options are a form of basket options.\nSwaps: Swaps are private agreements between two parties to exchange cash flows in the future according to a prearranged formula. They can be regarded as portfolios of forward contracts. The two commonly used swaps are: Interest rate swaps: These entail swapping only the interest related cash flows between the parties in the same currency and Currency swaps: These entail swapping both principal and interest between the parties, with the cash flows in one direction being in a different currency than those in the opposite direction.\nSwaptions: Swaptions are options to buy or sell a swap that will become operative at the expiry of the options. Thus a swaption is an option on a forward swap. Rather than have calls and puts, the swaptions market has receiver swaptions and payer swaptions. A receiver swaption is an option to receive fixed and pay floating. A payer swaption is an option to pay fixed and receive floating.\n3. Commodity Market [Commodity Derivatives]\n\nCommodity derivatives work almost the same way as financial derivatives, however with some differences.\u00a0In the case of financial derivatives,\u00a0most of these contracts are cash settled. Even in the case of physical settlement, financial\u00a0assets are not bulky and do not need special facility for storage. Due to the bulky nature\u00a0of the underlying assets, physical settlement in commodity derivatives creates the need\u00a0for warehousing. Similarly, the concept of varying quality of asset does not really exist\u00a0as far as financial underlying is concerned.\n\n4. Equity Market\n\nEquity, also called shares or scripts, is the basic building blocks of a company. A company\u2019s\u00a0ownership is determined on the basis of its shareholding. The BSE Sensex is the most popular index that tracks the movements of shares of 30\u00a0blue-chip companies on a weighted average basis. The rise and fall in the value of the\u00a0Sensex, measured in points, broadly indicates the price-movement of the value of shares. SEBI is the regulator of equity market in India.\n\nAlso read: Debt Sustainability\n\nNon-Securities Market\n\nMutual funds, Bank Deposits, Provident Fund, Post \u2013 office savings, Insurance etc. forms part of non-securities market.\n\nAlso read: Budget Documents Made Simple\n\nWhat is a Mutual Fund?\n\nA Mutual Fund is a body corporate registered with SEBI (Securities\u00a0Exchange Board of India) that pools money from individuals/corporate investors and invests the same in a variety of different\u00a0financial instruments or securities such as equity shares, Government\u00a0securities, Bonds, debentures, commercial paper\u00a0etc. Mutual funds can thus be considered\u00a0as financial intermediaries in the investment business that collect\u00a0funds from the public and invest on behalf of the investors. Mutual\u00a0funds issue units to the investors. The appreciation of the portfolio\u00a0or securities in which the mutual fund has invested the money leads\u00a0to an appreciation in the value of the units held by investors.",

    "[CONTENT] #633": "You might have heard terms like speculation, hedging, arbitrage, investment, trading etc. while reading the business page of your newspaper. For most of us, these are terms not very easy to understand or explain.\n\nIn this post we attempt explain the concept behind speculation and investment in layman\u2019s terms. We have used online sources like encyclopedia.com, investopedia.com etc. along with NOS and CBSE texts for reference.\n\nThe knowledge on these areas might turn quite handy for those with economics optional. Since UPSC Civil Services Interview also revolve around conceptual knowledge, understanding the fundamentals of economics always helps.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOverview\nSpeculation Transaction vs Investment Transactions\nSpeculation : As a matter of basic intention\nParticipants in the the derivative Market : Hedgers, Speculators and Arbitrageurs\nArbitrageurs\nHedgers\nSpeculators\nThe concept of Short Selling\nOverview\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the overview this topic.\n\nSpeculation Transaction vs Investment Transactions\n\nThe buyers and sellers at the stock exchange undertake mainly two types of operations, one for\u00a0speculation and the other for investment.\n\nInvestors: Those who buy securities primarily to earn a\u00a0regular income from such investment and possibly make some long-term gain on account\u00a0of price rise in future are called investors. They take delivery of the securities and make full\u00a0payment of the price. Such transactions are called investment transactions.\n\nSpeculators:\u00a0When the securities are bought with the sole object of selling them in future at higher\u00a0prices or these are sold now with the intention of buying at a lower price in future, are\u00a0called speculation transactions. The main objective of such transactions is to take advantage\u00a0of price differential at different times. The stock exchange also provides for settlement of\u00a0such transactions even by receiving or paying, as the case may be, just the difference in\u00a0prices.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFor example, Ramu bought 200 shares of Tata Steel Ltd. at Rs. 210 per share\u00a0and sold them at Rs. 235 per share. He does not take and give delivery of the shares but\u00a0settles the transactions by receiving the difference in prices amounting to Rs. 5,000 minus\u00a0brokerage. In another case, Manu bought 200 shares of ONGC Ltd. at Rs.\u00a087 per share and sold them at Rs. 69 per share. He settles these transactions by simply\u00a0paying the difference amounting to Rs. 3600 plus brokerage. However, now-a days stock\u00a0exchanges have a system of rolling settlement. Such facility is limited only to transactions\u00a0of purchase and sale made on the same day, as no carry forward is allowed.\n\nSpeculation : As a matter of basic intention\n\nThough speculation and investment are different in some respects, in practice it is difficult\u00a0to say who is a genuine investor and who is a pure speculator. Sometimes even a person\u00a0who has purchased the shares as a long-term investment may suddenly decide to sell to\u00a0reap the benefit if the price of the share goes up too high or do it to avoid heavy loss if the\u00a0prices starts declining steeply.\n\nBut he cannot be called a speculator because his basic\u00a0intention has been to invest. It is only when a person\u2019s basic intention is to take advantage\u00a0of a change in prices, and not to invest, then the transaction may be termed as speculation.\n\nSpeculation = Settlement by paying difference in price without delivery of securities\n\nIn strict technical terms, however, the transaction is regarded as speculative only if it is\u00a0settled by receiving or paying the difference in prices without involving the delivery of\u00a0securities. It is so because, in practice, it is quite difficult to ascertain the intention.\u00a0Some people regard speculation as nothing but gambling and consider it as an evil.\n\nBut it\u00a0is not true because while speculation is based on foresight and hard calculation, gambling\u00a0is a kind of blind and reckless activity involving high degree of chance element.\n\nNo only that, speculation is a legal activity duly recognized as a prerequisite for the success of stock exchange operations while gambling is regarded as an evil and a punishable activity. However, reckless speculation may take the form of gambling and should be avoided.\n\nParticipants in the the derivative Market : Hedgers, Speculators and Arbitrageurs\n\nThe following three broad categories of participants \u2013 hedgers,\u00a0speculators, and arbitrageurs trade in the derivatives market.\n\nArbitrageurs\n\nArbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of equivalent assets at prices which guarantee a fixed profit at the time of the transactions, although the life of the assets and, hence, the consummation of the profit may be delayed until some future date.\n\nThe key element in the definition is that the amount of profit be determined with certainty. It specifically excludes transactions which guarantee a minimum rate of return but which also offer an option for increased profits.\u00a0Arbitrageurs are in\u00a0business to take advantage of a discrepancy between prices in two different markets (Eg : NSE and BSE) .\n\nIf, for example, they see the futures price of an asset getting out of line with the cash\u00a0price, they will take offsetting positions in the two markets to lock in a profit.\n\nHedgers\n\nHedging is the simultaneous purchase and sale of two assets in the expectation of a gain from different subsequent movements in the price of those assets. Usually the two assets are equivalent in all respects except maturity.\u00a0Hedgers face risk associated\u00a0with the price of an asset. They use futures or options markets to reduce or eliminate\u00a0this risk.\n\nSpeculators\n\nSpeculation is the purchase or sale of an asset in the expectation of a gain from changes in the price of that asset.\u00a0Speculators wish to bet on future movements in the price of an asset. Futures\u00a0and options contracts can give them an extra leverage; that is, they can increase both\u00a0the potential gains and potential losses in a speculative venture. Day traders are speculators.\n\nNB : While Hedgers look to protect against a price change, speculators look to make profit from a price change. Also,\u00a0the hedger gives up some opportunity in exchange for reduced risk. The speculator on the other hand acquires opportunity in exchange for taking on risk.\n\nPS : Speculation involves high risk. Arbitrage involves limited risk. Hedging is done to avoid risk.\nThe concept of Short Selling\n\nShort selling is the sale of a security that is not owned by the seller, or that the seller has borrowed. Short selling is motivated by the belief that a security\u2019s price\u00a0will decline, enabling it to be bought back at a lower price to make a profit.\n\nShort selling may be prompted by speculation, or by the desire to hedge the downside risk of a long position in the same security or a related one. The risk of loss on a short sale is theoretically infinite.",

(Equity capital is the invested money that, in contrast to debt capital, is not repaid to the investors in the normal course of business.) For example, in a company, the total equity capital of Rs 5,00,00,000 is divided into 50,00,000 units of Rs 10 each. Each such unit of Rs 10 is called a Share. Thus, the company then is said to have 50,00,000 equity shares of Rs 10 each.\n\nNB: The holders of such shares are members of the company and\u00a0have voting rights.\n\nAlso read: Stock Market Regulations in India\n\nWhat is meant by a Stock Exchange?\n\nThe Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956 [SCRA] defines\u00a0\u2018Stock Exchange\u2019 as any body of individuals, whether incorporated\u00a0or not, constituted for the purpose of assisting, regulating or\u00a0controlling the business of buying, selling or dealing in securities.\u00a0Stock exchange could be a regional stock exchange or\nnational exchanges.\n\nWhat is a Depository?\n\nA depository is like a bank wherein the deposits are securities (viz.\u00a0shares, debentures, bonds, government securities, units etc.) in\u00a0electronic form.\u00a0At present there are two depositories in India, National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (CDS).\u00a0The minimum networth stipulated by SEBI for a depository is Rs 100 crore. A depository provides the following services:\n\nDematerialisation (demat), ie. is converting physical certificates to electronic form.\nRematerialisation (remat), i.e. getting physical certificates from the electronic securities.\nTransfer of securities or change of beneficial ownership.\nSettlement of trades done on exchange connected to the Depository.\nWhat is a Depository Participant (DP)?\n\nA Depository Participant (DP) is an agent of the depository through which it interfaces with the investor and provides depository services. Public financial institutions, scheduled commercial banks, foreign banks operating in India with the approval of the Reserve Bank of India, state financial corporations, custodians, stock-brokers, clearing corporations /clearing houses, NBFCs and Registrar to an Issue or Share Transfer Agent complying with the requirements prescribed by SEBI can be registered as DP.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn India, there are around 288 Depository Participants of NSDL which are registered with SEBI.

Transfer of resources from\u00a0those having idle resources (investors) to others who have a need for\u00a0them (corporates) is most efficiently achieved through the securities\u00a0market. Stated formally, securities markets provide channels for\u00a0reallocation of savings to investments and entrepreneurship. Savings\u00a0are linked to investments by a variety of intermediaries, through a\u00a0range of financial products, called \u2018Securities\u2019.\n\nAlso read: SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India)\n\nWhat is the role of the \u2018Primary Market\u2019?\n\nThe primary market provides the channel for sale of new securities.\u00a0Primary market provides opportunity to issuers of securities;\u00a0Government as well as corporates, to raise resources to meet their\u00a0requirements of investment and/or discharge some obligation. They\u00a0may issue the securities at face value, or at a discount/premium and\u00a0these securities may take a variety of forms such as equity, debt etc.\u00a0They may issue the securities in domestic market and/or international\u00a0market.\n\nWhy do companies need to issue shares to the public?\n\nMost companies are usually started privately by their promoter(s).\u00a0However, the promoters\u2019 capital and the borrowings from banks and\u00a0financial institutions may not be sufficient for setting up or running the\u00a0business over a long term. So companies invite the public to contribute\u00a0towards the equity and issue shares to individual investors. The way\u00a0to invite share capital from the public is through a \u2018Public Issue\u2019.\u00a0Simply stated, a public issue is an offer to the public to subscribe to\u00a0the share capital of a company. Once this is done, the company allots\u00a0shares to the applicants as per the prescribed rules and regulations\u00a0laid down by SEBI.\n\nWhat is an Initial Public Offer (IPO)?\n\nAn Initial Public Offer (IPO) is the selling of securities to the public\u00a0in the primary market. It is when an unlisted company makes either\u00a0a fresh issue of securities or an offer for sale of its existing securities\u00a0or both for the first time to the public. This paves way for listing and\u00a0trading of the issuer\u2019s securities. The sale of securities can be either\u00a0through book building or through normal public issue.\n\nWhat is a Prospectus ?\n\nA large number of new companies float public issues. While a large\u00a0number of these companies are genuine, quite a few may want to\u00a0exploit the investors. Therefore, it is very important that an investor\u00a0before applying for any issue identifies future potential of a company.\u00a0A part of the guidelines issued by SEBI (Securities and Exchange\u00a0Board of India) is the disclosure of 23 information to the public.\u00a0This disclosure includes information like the reason for raising the\u00a0money, the way money is proposed to be spent, the return expected\u00a0on the money etc. This information is in the form of \u2018Prospectus\u2019\u00a0which also includes information regarding the size of the issue, the\u00a0current status of the company, its equity capital, its current and past\u00a0performance, the promoters, the project, cost of the project, means of\u00a0financing, product and capacity etc. It also contains lot of mandatory\u00a0information regarding underwriting and statutory compliances. This\u00a0helps investors to\u00a0evaluate short term and long term prospects of the\u00a0company.\n\nWhat is meant by Market Capitalisation?\n\nThe market value of a quoted company, which is calculated by\u00a0multiplying its current share price (market price) by the number of\u00a0shares in issue is called as market capitalization. E.g. Company A has\u00a0120 crore shares in issue. The current market price is Rs. 100. The\u00a0market capitalisation of company A is Rs. 12000 crore.\n\nWhat is meant by Secondary market?\n\nSecondary market refers to a market where securities are traded after\u00a0being initially offered to the public in the primary market and/or\u00a0listed on the Stock Exchange. Majority of the trading is done in the\u00a0secondary market. Secondary market comprises of equity markets\u00a0and the debt markets.\n\nWhat is a Contract Note?\n\nContract Note is a confirmation of trades done on a particular day\u00a0on behalf of the client by a trading member (stock broker). It imposes a legally\u00a0enforceable relationship between the client and the trading member\u00a0with respect to purchase/sale and settlement of trades. It also helps to\u00a0settle disputes/claims between the investor and the trading member. It\u00a0is a prerequisite for filing a complaint or arbitration proceeding against\u00a0the trading member in case of a dispute. A valid contract note should\u00a0be in the prescribed form, contain the details of trades, stamped with\u00a0requisite value and duly signed by the authorized signatory. Contract\u00a0notes are kept in duplicate, the trading member and the client should\u00a0keep one copy each. After verifying the details contained therein,\u00a0the client keeps one copy and returns the second copy to the trading\u00a0member duly acknowledged by him.\n\nWhat is Insider Trading?\n\nInsider trading is defined as a malpractice wherein trade of a company\u2019s securities is undertaken by people who by virtue of their work have access to the otherwise non public information, which can be crucial for making investment decisions. When insiders (e.g. key employees or executives who have access to the strategic information about the company) use their strategic information for trading in the company\u2019s stocks or securities, it is called insider trading and is highly discouraged by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to promote fair trading in the market for the benefit of the common investor.\n\nBull Market vs Bear Market\n\nA bull market is a \u00a0financial market of a group of securities in which prices are rising or are expected to rise.\u00a0Bull markets are characterized by optimism, investor confidence and expectations that strong results will continue.\n\nBear market refers to a market condition in which the prices of securities are falling, and widespread pessimism causes the negative sentiment to be self-sustaining. As investors anticipate losses in a bear market and selling continues, pessimism only grows.\u00a0A bear market should not be confused with a correction, which is a short-term trend that has a duration of less than two months.\n\n[References : NSE, SEBI and Investopedia.]",

Now, poverty lines are set at $3.20 a day for people in \u201clower-middle-income\u201d countries, such as Egypt or India, and $5.50 a day for \u201cupper-middle-income\u201d countries, such as Jamaica or South Africa. The World Bank also released a third standard for high-income countries, like the US, at $21.70 a day.\n\nIn 2018, the World Bank introduced a Societal Poverty Line (SPL), to capture the relative aspect of poverty. The SPL is a hybrid line, combining the US$1.90-a-day absolute poverty line with a relative component that increases as median consumption or income in an economy rises.\n\nHowever, no single indicator can capture the multiple dimensions of poverty.\n\nPoverty Estimation by Dr Amartya Sen\n\nDr Amartya Sen provided a useful alternative to understanding poverty.\n\nHis capability approach to understanding poverty goes beyond income and stresses the whole range of means, available to achieve human capabilities such as literacy, longevity, and access to income.\n\nPoverty Line\n\nThe conventional approach to measuring poverty is to specify a minimum expenditure (or income) required to purchase a basket of goods and services necessary to satisfy basic human needs. This minimum expenditure is called the poverty line.\n\nThe basket of goods and services necessary to satisfy basic human needs is the Poverty Line Basket (PLB).\n\nThe proportion of the population below the poverty line is called the poverty ratio or headcount ratio (HCR).\n\nMost countries and international institutions (World Bank, United Nations, etc.) follow a similar approach to counting the poor.\n\nAlso read: Economic and Social Development \u2013 Sustainable Development, Poverty, Inclusion, Demographics, Social Sector Initiatives, etc.\n\nThe Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)\n\nThe Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is an international measure of multidimensional poverty covering 107 developing countries.\n\nGlobal MPI was first developed in 2010 by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for UNDP\u2019s Human Development Reports.\n\nThe Global MPI is released at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development of the United Nations in July, every year.\n\nGlobal MPI 2020\n\nThe Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) compares acute multidimensional poverty for 107 countries in developing regions. These countries are home to 5.9 billion people, three-quarters of the world\u2019s population.\n\nOf these people, 1.3 billion people (22%) are identified by the global MPI as multidimensionally poor as per the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index 2020.\n\nAccording to Global MPI 2020, India is 62nd among 107 countries with an MPI score of 0.123 and a\u00a027.91% headcount ratio, based on the NFHS 4 (2015/16) data.\n\n3 Dimensions and 10 Indicators in MPI\n\nThe MPI assesses poverty at the individual level.\n\nIf a person is deprived in a third or more of ten (weighted) indicators, the global MPI identifies them as \u2018MPI poor\u2019.\n\nThe extent \u2013 or intensity \u2013 of their poverty is also measured through the percentage of deprivations they are experiencing.\n\nHealth\tNutrition\tAny adult under 70 years of age or any child for whom there is nutritional information is undernourished.\nChild mortality\tAny child under the age of 18 years has died in the family in the five-year period preceding the survey.\nEducation\tYears of schooling\tNo household member aged \u2018school entrance age + six years or older have completed six years of schooling.\nSchool attendance\tAny school-aged child is not attending school up to the age at which he/she would complete class eight.\nStandard of living\tCooking Fuel\tThe household cooks with dung, wood, charcoal or coal.\nSanitation\tThe household\u2019s sanitation facility is not improved (according to SDG guidelines) or it is improved but shared with other households.\nDrinking-Water\tThe household does not have access to improved drinking water (according to SDG guidelines) or improved drinking water is at least a 30-minute walk from home, round trip.\nElectricity\tThe household has no electricity.\nHousing\tAt least one of the three housing materials for roof, walls and floor are inadequate: the floor is of natural materials and/or the roof and/or walls are of natural or rudimentary materials.\nAssets\tThe household does not own more than one of these assets: radio, television, telephone, computer, animal cart, bicycle, motorbike or refrigerator, and does not own a car or truck.\n\nOther parameters include:\n\ndisempowerment\npoor quality of work\nsocial exclusion\nrural-urban disparity\nthe threat of violence,\nliving in environmentally hazardous areas\nThe need for understanding multiple connotations\nMonetary-based poverty measures are inadequate: In most cases, not all individuals who are income-poor are multidimensionally poor, and not all multidimensionally poor individuals are income-poor.\nEconomic growth does not always reduce poverty or deprivation.\u00a0Several studies have found that economic growth is not strongly associated with a reduction in other deprivations, such as child malnutrition or child mortality.\nPoverty as multidimensional: Poor people describe ill-being to include poor health, nutrition, lack of adequate sanitation and clean water, social exclusion, low education, bad housing conditions, violence, shame, disempowerment, and much more.\nNeed for more policy-relevant information on poverty, so that policymakers are better equipped to deal with it: For example, an area in which most people are deprived of education requires a different poverty reduction strategy from an area in which most people are deprived of housing conditions.\nPoverty Estimation in India\n\nIn India, the first official rural and urban poverty lines at the national level were introduced in 1979 by Y. K. Alagh Committee and official poverty counts began for the first time.\n\nLater, in 1993, the D. T. Lakdawala Committee extended these poverty lines to states and over time allowing official poverty counts over time and in the states.\n\nIn 2005, recognizing that the rural poverty line was too low, the government appointed the Tendulkar committee to take a fresh look at the poverty lines. Reporting in 2009, the Tendulkar Committee revised upward the rural poverty line. Continued media criticisms led the government to appoint the Rangarajan Committee in 2012.\n\nReporting in June 2014, the Rangarajan Committee recommended raising further both the rural and urban poverty lines. The decision is yet to be taken on the Rangarajan Committee recommendations.\n\nTherefore, the Tendulkar poverty line remains the official poverty line and is the basis of the current official poverty estimates in 1993-94, 2004-05, and 2011-12.\n\nNote: As per the Tendulkar estimation, the percentage of people living below the poverty line in India is 21.9%. However, as per Rangarajan\u2019s estimation, the percentage of people living below the poverty line in India is 29.5%.\n\nAlso read: Urban Poverty\n\nPoverty alleviation programs in India\n\nIndia has been conducting various poverty alleviation programs.\n\nEmployment programmes and skill-building\nJawahar Gram Samriddhi Yojana:\u00a0The JRY was meant to generate meaningful employment opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed in rural areas through the creation of economic infrastructure and community and social assets.\nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) 2005: The Act provides 100 days of assured employment every year to every rural household. One-third of the proposed jobs would be reserved for women. Under the programme, if an applicant is not employed within 15 days s/he will be entitled to a daily unemployment allowance.\nNational Rural Livelihood Mission: Ajeevika (2011): It evolves out the need to diversify the needs of the rural poor and provide them jobs with regular income every month. Self Help Groups are formed at the village level to help the needy.\nNational Urban Livelihood Mission: The NULM focuses on organizing urban poor in Self Help Groups, creating opportunities for skill development leading to market-based employment and helping them to set up self-employment ventures by ensuring easy access to credit.\nPradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana: It will focus on the fresh entrants to the labor market, especially the labor market and class X and XII dropouts.\nFood and shelter\nFood for Work Programme:\u00a0It aims at enhancing food security through wage employment. Food grains are supplied to states free of cost, however, the supply of food grains from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns has been slow.\nAnnapurna: This scheme was started by the government in 1999\u20132000 to provide food to senior citizens who cannot take care of themselves and are not under the National Old Age Pension Scheme (NOAPS). This scheme would provide 10 kg of free food grains a month for eligible senior citizens. They mostly target groups of \u2018poorest of the poor\u2019 and \u2018indigent senior citizens\u2019.\nPradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana: It has two components: Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Grameen) and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Urban). It was launched in 2015. It unites schemes like Ujjwala Yojana (provides LPG to BPL), access to toilets, water, and drinking water facilities, and Saubhagya Yojana (electricity).\nOther schemes like the Integrated Child Development Program, Midday Meal scheme, etc are also providing food to the needy sections like children and women.\nAccess to credit\nPradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi: This scheme aims to provide financial assistance to provide working capital support to all the landholding farmers. This brings in the idea of universal basic income for the farmers in India.\nPradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana: It aimed at direct benefit transfer of subsidy, pension, insurance, etc., and attained the target of opening 1.5 crore bank accounts. The scheme particularly targets the unbanked poor.\nIntegrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP): It was introduced in 1978-79 and aimed at assisting the rural poor in the form of subsidy and bank credit for productive employment opportunities through successive plan periods.\nChallenges\nThe incidence of extreme poverty continues to be much higher in rural areas than in urban areas.\nDespite rapid growth and development,\u00a0an unacceptably high proportion of our population continues to suffer from severe and multidimensional deprivation.\u00a0\nWhile a large number of poverty alleviation programmes have been initiated, they function in silos. There is\u00a0no systematic attempt to identify people who are in poverty, determine their needs, address them, and enable them to move above the poverty line.\nThe\u00a0resources allocated to anti-poverty programmes are inadequate and there is a tacit understanding that targets will be curtailed according to fund availability. For instance, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act does not provide the guaranteed 100 days of work in many states.\nThere is\u00a0no method to ensure that programmes reach everybody they are meant for.\nLack of proper implementation and right targeting\nThere has been a\u00a0lot of overlapping of schemes.\nEvery year a huge number is added to the population pool of the country.\u00a0This renders the scheme ineffective.\nWay Forward\n\nThe World Health Organization has described poverty as the greatest cause of suffering on earth. Poverty eradication should not be the goal of the government but the goal of the government policies should be to create prosperity. Both monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty are needed to better inform the policies intended to address the needs and deprivations faced by poor populations.\n\nAccelerating rural poverty reduction:\nIt\u2019s\u00a0not just about agricultural growth, which has long been considered the key driver of poverty reduction. Rural India is not predominantly agricultural and shares many of the economic conditions of smaller urban areas.\nCapitalizing on the growing connectivity between rural and urban areas, and between the agriculture, industry, and services sectors, has been effective in the past.\nCreating more and better jobs\nFuture efforts will need to address job creation in more productive sectors, which has until now been lukewarm and has yielded few salaried jobs that offer stability and security.\nFocusing on women and Scheduled Tribes\nThe most worrying trends are the\u00a0low participation of women in the labour market and the\u00a0slow progress among scheduled tribes.\nIndia\u2019s women\u00a0have been\u00a0withdrawing from the labour force since 2005and less than one-third of working-age women are now in the labour force. As a result, India today ranks last among BRICS countries, and close to the bottom in South Asia in female labour force participation.\nScheduled Tribes\u00a0started with the highest poverty rates of all of India\u2019s social groups, and have progressed more slowly than the rest.\nWomen and Scheduled Tribes\u00a0are at risk of being locked out of India\u2019s growth and prosperity.\nImproving human development outcomes for the poor\nThe recent past shows that some problems, such as\u00a0undernutrition and open defecation, are endemic and not only confined to the poor but others too, and have not improved with economic growth.\nBetter health, sanitation, and education will not only help raise the productivity of millions, they will also empower the people to meet their aspirations and provide the country with new drivers of economic growth.\n\nTogether with mooting the discussion on the need to provide a universal basic income, infrastructural and skill development combined with effective implementation of welfare policies will go a long way in eradicating poverty in the country.\n\nRead:\u00a0Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES)",

Read further to know more.\n\nHuman capital, unlike physical capital, is intangible.\n\nYou all may have heard of the term \u2018capital\u2019 in economics. Adam Smith defines capital as \u201cThat part of man\u2019s stock which he expects to afford him revenue\u201d. Capital is one of the four factors of production \u2013 land, labour, and entrepreneurship being the other three.\n\nThere are many types of capital. However, for time being, we shall focus our discussion on two types of capital \u2013 physical capital and human capital.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPhysical Capital vs Human Capital\nWhat is Human Capital?\nHuman Capital vs Human Resource\nHuman capital definition\nTo Increase Human Capital, Where should you invest?\nHuman Capital vs Human Development\nFocus on Human Development\nWhere does India stand in terms of Human Capital or Human Development?\nHuman Development Agenda of the Government\nDemographic Dividend: Advantage of India\nHuman Development Report\nHuman Development Index 2018\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)\nGovernment\u2019s role in building human capital\nHuman Capital as per the Economic Survey of India\nGovernment Expenditure on Human Development\nConclusion\nPhysical Capital vs Human Capital\n\nPhysical Capital:\u00a0Physical capital is related to the non-human assets which help in the production process. \u00a0It includes machinery, buildings, computers, etc \u2013 which is tangible in nature. Physical capital is divided into 2 categories \u2013 working capital and fixed capital.\n\nHuman Capital: Human capital is connected with human assets \u2013 education, health, or skills. It cannot be touched, however, it can be measured and analysed.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is Human Capital?\n\nHuman capital is a term that denotes the monetary value of the knowledge, skills, and competencies of a person.\n\nTo calculate the human capital of an individual, you need to take his earnings today and add with it what he is likely to earn in future.\n\nHuman Capital vs Human Resource\n\nIn the manufacturing economy, humans are counted as \u2018labour\u2019 \u2013 one of the four factors of production. In that sense, an individual is a resource \u2013 ie. labour/worker.\n\nHowever, as we moved from a manufacturing economy to an informational economy, there is a paradigm shift in the way humans are seen. A human being is now not seen as a resource/labour, but rather is seen as an asset or capital. Hence the term \u2018Human Capital\u2019. Remember what we mentioned in the beginning \u2013 capital is also one of the four factors of production.\n\nHuman capital definition\n\nAccording to the OECD, human capital is defined as:\n\n\u201cthe knowledge, skills, competencies and other attributes embodied in individuals or groups of individuals acquired during their life and used to produce goods, services or ideas in market circumstances\u201d.\n\nHuman capital is viewed in terms of its value with respect to an organization or country.\n\nTo Increase Human Capital, Where should you invest?\n\nGenerally, human capital formation is considered as the outcome of investments in\n\neducation\nhealth\nskill/on-the-job training\nmigration\ninformation/digital literacy\n\nClearly, three of the most important pillars of human capital are Education, Health and Skills/Employment.\n\nThese are precisely the three vehicles through which various governments are focusing to build the human capital of next-generation citizens.\n\nIn this article we will focus on human capital in general, emphasizing on Human Development Report. We have already written on Education, Health, and Skill/Employment, however, you can expect more elaborate articles on the same from us in future, covering the entire gamut of human capital.\n\nHuman Capital vs Human Development\n\nThough both terms are used interchangeably, there is a difference between the two concepts:\n\nHuman capital considers education, health and other investments as a means to increase labour productivity. The concept considers human beings as a means to an end; the end being the increase in productivity.\nWhereas human development considers\u00a0human beings as ends in themselves and thus\u00a0education, health etc. as their rights.\nFocus on Human Development\n\nIt is from the 7th Five Year Plan onward that we began to focus on Human Development. To quote the Plan document, \u201cHuman resources development has necessarily to be assigned a key role in any development strategy, particularly in a country with a large population.\u00a0Trained and educated on sound lines, a large population can itself become an asset in accelerating\u00a0economic growth\u00a0and\u00a0ensuring a social change in desired directions\u201c.\n\nWhere does India stand in terms of Human Capital or Human Development?\n\nIndia\u2019s achievements in this field are not that envious.\n\nIndia stands at 102/130 \u2014 Global Human Capital Index, 2017.\n\nIndia\u2019s rank in Human Development Index (HDI) 2018 is 130.\n\nAmartya Sen, in his book, \u2018An Uncertain Glory: India and Its Contradictions \u2018 opined that: India should invest in its public services. Leaving aside her per capita income, which has grown impressively, India is falling behind its neighbours in South Asia in the social indicators.\n\nHuman Development Agenda of the Government\n\nBe that as it may, human development is an important agenda in government policies. Economic Survey 2018-19 has opined that:\n\n\u2018Inclusiveness has been the cornerstone of India\u2019s development agenda. Over the last few years, efforts in this direction have been accelerated by the Government through the mantra of inclusiveness \u2018Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas\u2019, further elaborated by ensuring \u2018Sabka Vishwas\u2019.\n\nAs India is a developing economy with resource constraints, we have to prioritize and optimize the expenditure on social infrastructure to promote sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\nIt is critical at this juncture to focus on public investments in human capital and strengthen the delivery mechanisms of government interventions to ensure transparency and accountability.\n\nWith India having the demographic advantage, improving educational standards, skilling the youth, enhancing job opportunities, reducing disease burden and empowering women will help in realizing the potential of a buoyant economy in the future.\n\nRead:\u00a0Human Development in India\n\nDemographic Dividend: Advantage of India\n\nIndia is home to the world\u2019s youngest population as half of its population is below the age of 25.\n\nThis demographic advantage in India is available for five decades from 2005-06 to 2055-56, longer than any other country in the world.\n\nThis demographic advantage can be reaped only if education, skilling, and employment opportunities are provided to the young population.\n\nRead:\u00a0Demographic Dividend\n\nHuman Development Report\n\nHuman Development Report (HDR) is published by UNDP. HDI takes into account three indicators vis, long healthy life, access to knowledge, access to a decent standard of living.\n\nHDR 2016 has opined that India\u2019s economic progress since 1991 has not been translated to human investment, resulting in a\u00a0lost decade\u00a0for India. Universalizing health and education could have pulled the population out of the poverty trap. There is a need to ask the question: who had benefited from the development and why only them?\n\nHuman Development Index 2018\n\nIndia climbed one spot to 130 out of 189 countries. India\u2019s HDI value for 2017 is 0.640, and thus India is in the medium human development category.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2017, India\u2019s HDI value increased from 0.427 to 0.640, an increase of nearly 50 percent.\u00a0Within South Asia, India\u2019s HDI value is above the average of 0.638 for the region, with Bangladesh and Pakistan, countries with similar population size, being ranked 136 and 150 respectively.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2017, India\u2019s life expectancy at birth increased by nearly 11 years, with more significant gains in expected years of schooling.\n\nToday\u2019s Indian school-age children can expect to stay in school for 4.7 years longer than in 1990.\n\nIndia\u2019s GNI per capita increased by 266.6% between 1990 and 2017.\n\nNorway, Switzerland, Australia, Ireland, and Germany lead the ranking, while Niger, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Chad and Burundi have the lowest scores.\n\nDisparities between and within countries continue to stifle progress. Scrutiny of HDI\u2019s components reveals the unequal distribution of outcomes in education, life expectancy and income within countries. The Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) compares levels of inequality within countries.\n\n26.8% of India\u2019s HDI value is lost on account of inequalities, which is more than its South Asian neighbours. This confirms that inequality remains a challenge for India as it progresses economically. State-level HDIs reveal the inter-state disparities in India.\n\nSubnational Human Development\u00a0Index (SHDI) for different States for the period 1990 and 2017, released by UNDP shows that all states have shown significant improvement in levels of human development. Most Southern and Northern States have performed much better as compared to their Eastern counterparts who have registered poor performance in SHDIs. Goa, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, and Punjab occupy the top four positions while Bihar, UP, and MP are at the bottom.\n\nFrancine Pickup, Country Director, UNDP India said, \u201cThe Government of India is committed to improving the quality of life for all its people. The success of India\u2019s national development schemes like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Swachh Bharat, Make in India, and initiatives aimed at universalizing school education and health care, will be crucial in ensuring that the upward trend on human development accelerates and also achieve the Prime Minister\u2019s vision of development for all and the key principle of the Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 to leave no one behind.\u201d\n\nGender gaps in the early years are closing, but inequalities persist in adulthood. Despite considerable progress at the policy and legislative levels, women remain significantly less politically, economically and socially empowered than men. Only 39 percent of adult women have reached at least a secondary level of education as compared to 64 percent of males. Female participation in the labor market is 27.2 percent compared to 78.8 for men. India ranks 127 out of 160 countries on the Gender Inequality Index.\n\nQuality of Development should also be kept in focus apart from HDI numbers.\n\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG)\n\nThe 17 SDGs and 169 targets envisaged in the Agenda 2030 are closely interrelated with social infrastructure.\n\nWith the underlying dimensions of education and health embedded in SDGs, the improvement in the Human Development Index is also interlinked to SDGs.\n\nNITI Aayog has developed SDG India Index to measure India\u2019s performance in SDGs.\n\nSDG India Index 2018 indicates Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Himachal Pradesh as top-performing states while Bihar, UP, Assam as the lowest performers.\n\nWe will look into specific goals of SDG which are related to Human Development in later sections.\n\nGovernment\u2019s role in building human capital\n\nSince it is hard to establish a co-relation of visible cause and effect from the growth of human capital (education, health etc.) to economic growth, there is low political will and investment in this sector. But investments in human capital can\u2019t be outsourced to private players completely. Government intervention is essential in this field because:\n\nSince education and health create both private and social benefits, both private and public institutions are needed in these fields.\nExpenditures on education and health make a substantial long-term impact and\u00a0they cannot be easily reversed, so government intervention is necessary.\nIndividual consumers of these services do not have complete information about the quality of services and their costs.\u00a0This may create monopoly\u00a0power and\u00a0exploitation by private players if adequate government regulation is not present.\nThe main role of the government is to ensure private providers of these services adhere to the standards stipulated by the government and charge the correct price.\nIn modern human rights vocabulary, these are considered vital rights of citizens.\nGovernment intervention in this area is required for improving accessibility and providing cost-effective services to the poor.\nMoreover, as per World Economic Forum, strengthening the policy and institutional ecosystem supporting inclusive growth and human capital development deserves to be a top policy priority for countries, whether they are experiencing slow growth, elevated inequality, or both. This is imperative for countries seeking to thrive in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\nThus because of both the intrinsic value and instrumental value of human capital, the government should actively involve itself in this arena.\n\nWith a slew of measures and policies like New Education Policy, New Health Policy and legislation like the National Medical Commission etc., the government is focusing on milking the demographic dividend. Concurrently, as per the Economic Survey, the government\u2019s expenditure on social sector has also increased.\n\nHuman Capital as per the Economic Survey of India\n\nTo engineer an inclusive and sustainable growth for India, the social infrastructure like education, health and social protection are being given utmost priority by the Government. The Government has been enhancing the expenditure on human capital along with adopting measures to improve the efficiency of expenditure by a convergence of schemes. Several labour reform measures including legislative ones are being implemented for the creation of employment opportunities and for providing sustainable livelihoods for the population who are largely engaged in the informal economy. Bridging the gender gaps in education, skill development, employment, earnings and reducing social inequalities prevalent in the society have been the underlying goals of the development strategy to enhance human capabilities.\n\n\u2013 Economic Survey 2016-17.\n\nGovernment Expenditure on Human Development\n\nGovernment expenditure on social infrastructures like health and education reflects the government\u2019s commitment to these sectors.\n\nIt is also necessary for improving accessibility for marginal and vulnerable sections of society.\n\nThe expenditure on social services by the Centre and States as a proportion of GDP has increased by more than 1% points during the period 2014-15 to 2018-19.\n\nThe increase was spread across all social sectors.\n\nThe share of expenditure on social services out of total budgetary expenditure increased from 24.9% in 2013-14 to 26% in 2018-19.\n\nConclusion\n\nHuman capital is a term that denotes the economic value of the knowledge, skills, and competencies of a person.\n\nFor a country like India, with a one-time huge opportunity of demographic dividend, it\u2019s high time to focus on human capital.\n\nUnless, we give adequate stress to education, health and skills \u2013 we will lose this golden opportunity.\n\nAs of now, our rank in various indices \u2013 human capital and human resource \u2013 is not encouraging. Both government and private entities should give better focus on the same.\n\nArticle written by : Sethu Krishnan M, curated by ClearIAS Team",

Nalanda has the oldest university system of education in the world. Students from across the world were attracted to Indian knowledge systems.\n\nMany branches of the knowledge system had their origin in India. Education was considered a higher virtue in ancient India.\n\nHowever, the renaissance and scientific thinking as happened in Europe didn\u2019t happen in India at that time.\n\nThe British who took control of the Indian affairs by that time had different priorities. Education in British India initially lagged a lot.\n\nHowever, later, the British established the modern education system still followed in India. They replaced age-old systems of education in the country with English ways.\u00a0\n\nStill, the education system in India needs a lot of reforms.\n\nAlso read: Examination System in India\n\nCurrent Status of Education in India: Data from Census 2011\n\nLiteracy rate in India as per\u00a0Census 2011:\u00a074%.\nLiteracy rate: Male: 82.1%; Female: 65.5%\nKerala tops the rankings, followed by Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu.\nBihar is the lowest among states, followed by Arunachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, etc., however, they are improving their position.\nBihar has a literacy rate of 63.8%, and that of women is 53.3%.\nLiteracy rates for both adults as well as youths have increased, still, the absolute number of illiterates in India is as much as India\u2019s population was at the time of independence.\nThe gender gap in terms of literacy began to narrow first in 1991 and the pace has accelerated, however still lags far behind the global female literacy rate of 7% (UNESCO 2015).\nThere are large state variations in the gender gap.\nHowever, during 2001 \u2013 2011, the male literacy rate increased by 6 percentage points but female literacy increased by nearly 12 percentage points. Achievement in female literacy in Bihar is noteworthy: from 33% in 2001 to 53% in 2011.\nBe that as it may, India is still lagging behind the world\u00a0literacy rate of 86.3%(UNESCO 2015).\u00a0A major group of states lies in the average rank i.e. just above the national level of 64.8 percent.\u00a0\nIndian Education System: The Present Pyramidal Structure\n\nThe Indian education system can broadly be considered as a pyramidal structure:\n\nPre-primary level: 5-6 years of age.\nPrimary (elementary) level: 6-14 years of age. Elementary-level education is guaranteed by our constitution under Article 21 A. For this level, the government has introduced Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) under the Right To Education(RTE) Act.\nSecondary level: Age group between 14-18. For this level, the government has extended SSA to secondary education in the form of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.\nHigher education: generally of three levels: UG\u2192 PG\u2192 MPhil/PhD. To cater to the requirements of higher education,\u00a0the government has introduced Rashtriya Uchhattar Shiksha Abhiyan(RUSA).\n\nRead: Examination System in India\n\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG) related to Education\n\nGoal 4 of SDG: Education for all \u2013 ensures equitable, inclusive, and quality education along with the promotion of lifelong learning opportunities for all by 2030.\n\nProvisions in the Indian Constitution related to Education\nUnder\u00a0Article 45 in DPSP, it was mentioned that the government should provide free and compulsory education for all children up to the age of 14 years within 10 years from the commencement of the Constitution. As this was not achieved, Article 21A was introduced by\u00a0the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2002, making elementary education a fundamental right rather than a directive principle. Article 45 was amended to provide for early childhood care and education to children below the age of six years.\nTo implement Article 21A, the government legislated the RTE Act. Under this act, SSA \u2013 Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan \u2013 got a further impetus. SSA aims to provide Universalization of Elementary Education (UEE) in a time-bound manner.\nSSA has been operational since 2000-2001. Its roots go back to 1993-1994 when the District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) was launched. However, under the RTE Act, it got legal backing.\nRTE Act 2009\n86th Amendment Act 2002 introduced Article 21-A, which provides for free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right.\nThe Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act was enacted to implement this fundamental right.\nProvisions of the RTE Act\nRight of children to free and compulsory education till completion of elementary education in a neighborhood school.\n\u2018Compulsory education\u2019 means an obligation of the government to provide free elementary education and ensure compulsory admission, attendance, and completion of\u00a0elementary education.\nProvision for a non-admitted child to be admitted to an age-appropriate class.\nNorms and standards like Pupil pupil-teacher ratios (PTRs), buildings and infrastructure, school-working days, teacher-working hours, and appropriately trained and qualified teachers are\u00a0enumerated.\nRational deployment of teachers, ensuring that there is no urban-rural imbalance in their postings.\nProhibition of deployment of teachers for non-educational work, other than services like decennial census, elections, etc.\nIt prohibits (a) physical punishment and mental harassment (b) screening procedures for admission of children (c) capitation fees (d) private tuition by teachers (e) running of schools without recognition.\nDevelopment of curriculum in consonance with the values enshrined in the constitution, ensuring all-around development of the child, building a system of child-friendly and child-centered learning.\nTo further inclusiveness, 25%\u00a0reservation is provided for disadvantaged students in private schools.\nCriticisms of the RTE Act\nEven though the RTE + SSA have increased access to schools, resulting in a high enrollment rate, dropout rates increased in tandem. However, there is inadequate attention given to this scenario.\nThere is inadequate attention to the PTR:\nThere is a fear of financial burden on the government for teacher recruitment and training.\nThe grey area of teacher transfer is also not helping the cause.\nThere is a provision for the academic calendar to be decided by the local authority, but it has not been implemented.\nSince all state holidays are not relevant for all localities, such a calendar preparation by local authorities can increase attendance and can also encourage local panchayats to take ownership of schools.\nThere is a divergence between urban-rural and rich-poor education.\nRTE students in private schools are paying extra fees as the schools claim that the government fund provided for the same is not adequate.\nMost private schools treat RTE as charity and demand that the onus of universalizing education should be on the government\u2019s head rather than putting pressure on them.\n70% of students are in government schools. So it must be fixed in priority, by providing infrastructure, teacher quality, and targeted\u00a0learning\u00a0for children from\u00a0disadvantaged\u00a0groups to provide an equitable education system.\nRajya Sabha amends the RTE bill, scrapping the no-detention policy and thus\u00a0reinstating detention for students of Class V and Class VIII if they fail to pass examinations.\nUnder the RTE Act, till class 8, students should not be failed in exams. This is called the No detention policy. It had reduced dropout rates.\nThere is growing criticism of the policy resulting in reducing the quality of elementary education. Hence the RTE Act was amended to scrap the policy.\nRTE Act prioritized schooling of children only from the age of 6, thus ignoring pre-school education. Kothari Commission had recommended the establishment of a center for the development of pre-primary education in each district.\nRTE Act recommends a PTR of 30:1 for primary classes and 35:1 for upper primary classes\nDistrict Information System for Education (DISE) report states that 30% of primary and 15% of upper primary schools have higher PTRs.\nAccording to the Economic Survey 2018-19, the PTR at the national level for primary schools is 23 and 27 for secondary schools. Thus PTR appears to be satisfactory, as there are sufficient teachers. However, the main issue is a balanced deployment of teachers based on student strength.\nEven though the Student-Classroom ratio (SCR) improved in almost all of the States, there is disparity across the country.\nModern Education in India: The Evolution of the System through various policies\n\nThe British government had introduced modern education in India. From Macaulay\u2019s minutes to Wood\u2019s dispatch to several commissions like the Sadler Commission, 1904 Indian education policy, etc. built the foundation of the Indian education system during the colonial period.\n\nRadhakrishnan committee\n\nIn 1948-49, the University Education Commission was constituted under Radhakrishnan. It molded the education system based on the needs of an independent India. The pre-Independent Indian education value system was catering to colonial masters. There was a need to replace Macaulayism\u00a0with the Indian value system.\u00a0(Macaulayism\u00a0is the policy of eliminating indigenous culture through the planned substitution of the alien culture of a colonizing power via the education system). Some of the values mentioned in the commission were:\n\nWisdom and Knowledge\u00a0\nAims of the Social Order: the desired social order for which youths are being educated.\nLove for higher values in life\nTraining for Leadership\n\nThe Independent Indian education system developed along the lines of this value framework. In the present times, where there are imminent threats of political ideologies hijacking the pedagogy of education and commercialization of education eroding value systems, it is appreciable to dust off the values promulgated by the commission. A recent controversial circular by the Central University of Kerala (CUK), directing that research topics for Ph.D. students must be by \u2018national priorities\u2019, and research in \u2018irrelevant topics\u2019 and \u2018privilege areas\u2019 must be discouraged, is a case in point.\n\nKothari commission\n\nIf the Radhakrishnan committee charted out the value system of the Indian education system, it was the Kothari Commission that provided the basic framework of the same. The commission provided for:\n\nStandardization of educational system on 10+2+3 pattern.\nEmphasized the need to make work experience and social/national service an integral part of education.\nLinking of colleges to several schools in the neighborhood.\nEqualization of opportunities to all and to achieve\u00a0social and national integration.\nNeighborhood school system without social or religious segregation and a school complex system integrating\u00a0primary and secondary levels of education.\nEstablishment of Indian Education Service.\nOn-the-job training of the teaching staff and efforts to raise the status of the teachers to attract talents into the profession.\nTo raise expenditure on education from 2.9% of the GDP to 6% by 1985.\n\nThis committee report paved the way for the National Educational Policy 1968 which provided the base and roadmap for further development of the education system in India.\n\nNational Educational Policy\u00a01968\nThe policy provided for \u201cradical restructuring\u201d and\u00a0equalization of educational opportunities to achieve national integration and greater cultural and economic development.\nIncrease public expenditure on education to 6% of GDP.\nProvide for better training and qualification of teachers.\nThree-language formula: state governments should implement the study of a modern Indian language, preferably one of the southern languages, apart from Hindi and English in the Hindi-speaking states, and of Hindi along with the regional language and English in the non-Hindi-speaking states. Hindi was encouraged uniformly to promote a common language for all Indians.\nNational Educational Policy\u00a01985\nThe policy aimed at the removal of disparities and to equalize educational opportunities, especially for women, SC and ST.\nLaunching of \u201cOperation Blackboard\u201d\u00a0to improve primary schools nationwide.\nIGNOU, the Open University, was formed.\nAdoption of the \u201crural university\u201d model, based on the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi, to promote economic and social development at the grassroots level in rural India.\nT.S.R.Subramanium committee report\nEarly Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) \u2013\u00a0children from four to five years of age \u2013 to be declared as a fundamental right.\nECCE is inconsistent across states. So all government schools should have facilities for pre-primary education, which would facilitate pre-school education by the government instead of the private sector.\nExam reform:\nThe policy of no detention should be upheld only till class five and not till class eight.\nTeacher Management:\nThere is a steep rise in teacher shortage, absenteeism, and grievances.\nNeed to constitute an Autonomous Teacher Recruitment Board.\nFour years integrated B.Ed. the course should be introduced.\nICT in Education:\nThere is an inadequate integration of information technology (IT) and the education sector.\nVocational education and training:\nThe National Skills Qualification Framework should be scaled up.\nThe choice of vocational courses should be in line with local opportunities and resources.\u00a0\nBringing formal certification for vocational education at par with conventional education certificates.\nAll India Education Service.\nNational Higher Education Promotion and Management Act (NHEPMA):\nExisting separate laws governing individual regulators in higher education\u00a0should be replaced by the said act.\nThe role of existing regulatory bodies like UGC and AICTE should be revised.\nNational Accreditation Board (NAB) subsuming the existing accreditation bodies.\nKasturirangan Report On School Education (Draft National Education Policy)\n\nFor restructuring the education system in India, the government is preparing to roll out a New Education Policy that will cater to Indian needs in the 4th Industrial Revolution by making use of its demographic dividend. Committee for Draft National Education Policy (chaired by Dr. K. Kasturirangan) submitted its report on May 31, 2019.\n\nYou can read about the National Education Policy 2020 in detail here.\n\nSchool Education:\u00a0\nProblems\nLow accessibility.\nThe curriculum doesn\u2019t meet the developmental needs of children.\nLack of qualified and trained teachers.\nSubstandard pedagogy.\nCurrently, most early childhood education is delivered through anganwadis and private preschools. However, there has been less focus on the educational aspects of early childhood.\nThe policy recommends developing a two-part curriculum for early childhood care and education.\nGuidelines for up to three-year-old children.\nEducational framework for three to eight-year-old children.\nThis would be implemented by improving and expanding the Anganwadi system and co-locating anganwadis with primary schools.\nThe Right to Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act):\nExpanding the ambit of the Act to all children between the ages of three to 18 years, thus\u00a0including early childhood education and secondary school education.\nReview recent amendments to the RTE Act on continuous and comprehensive evaluation and the no-detention policy.\nThere should be no detention of children till class eight. Instead, schools must ensure that children are achieving age-appropriate learning levels.\nCurriculum framework:\nThe current structure of school education is to be restructured based on the development needs of students.\n10+2+3 structure to be replaced by 5-3-3-4 design comprising: (i) five years of foundational stage (three years of pre-primary school and classes one and two), (ii) three years of preparatory stage (classes three to five), (iii) three years of middle stage (classes six to eight), and (iv) four years of secondary stage (classes nine to 12).\nThe current education system solely focuses on rote learning. The curriculum load should be reduced to its essential core content.\nSchool exam reforms:\nCurrent board examinations:\nForce students to concentrate only on a few subjects.\nDo not test learning in a formative manner.\nCause stress among students.\nTo track students\u2019 progress throughout their school experience, State Census Examinations in classes three, five, and eight should be established.\nRestructure the board examinations to test only the core concept. These board examinations will be on a range of subjects. The students can choose their subjects and the semester when they want to take these board exams. The in-school final examinations may be replaced by these board examinations.\nSchool infrastructure:\nAlthough establishing primary schools in every habitation has increased access to education, it has led to the development of very small schools making it operationally complex. Hence the multiple public schools should be brought together to form a school complex.\nA complex will consist of one secondary school (classes nine to twelve) and all the public schools in its neighborhood that offer education from pre-primary to class eight.\nThese will also include anganwadis, vocational education facilities, and an adult education center.\nEach school complex will be a semi-autonomous unit providing integrated education across all stages from early childhood to secondary education.\nThis will ensure that resources such as infrastructure and trained teachers can be efficiently shared across a school complex.\nTeacher management:\nA steep rise in a teacher shortage, lack of professionally qualified teachers, and deployment of teachers for non-educational purposes have plagued the system.\nTeachers should be deployed with a particular school complex for at least five to seven years.\nThey will not be allowed to participate in any non-teaching activities during school hours.\nExisting B.Ed. the program will be replaced by a four-year integrated B.Ed. program that combines high-quality content, pedagogy, and practical training. An integrated continuous professional development will also be developed for all subjects.\nRegulation of schools:\nSeparating the regulation of schools from aspects such as policymaking, school operations, and academic development.\nIndependent State School Regulatory Authority for each state will prescribe basic uniform standards for public and private schools.\nThe Department of Education of the State will formulate policy and conduct monitoring and supervision.\nHigher Education\nAccording to the All India Survey on Higher Education, the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education in India has increased from 20.8% in 2011-12 to 25.8% in 2017-18. Lack of access is a major reason behind the low intake of higher education. The policy aims to increase GER to 50% by 2035.\nRegulatory structure and accreditation:\nMultiple regulators with overlapping mandates reduce the autonomy of higher educational institutions and create an environment of dependency and centralized decision-making.\nThe National Higher Education Regulatory Authority (NHERA) should\u00a0replace the existing individual regulators in higher education. Thus the role of all professional councils such as AICTE would be limited to setting standards for professional practice. The role of the UGC will be limited to providing grants.\nSeparate the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) from the UGC into an independent and autonomous body. It will function as the top-level accreditor and will issue licenses to different accreditation institutions. All existing higher education institutions should be accredited by 2030.\nEstablishment of new higher educational institutions:\nReplacing the current system of establishing higher educational institutions by Parliament or state legislatures. Instead, institutions can be set up through a Higher Education Institution Charter from NHERA.\nRestructuring of higher education institutions:\nPhasing out the current complex system of naming Higher education institutions(HEI) as \u2018deemed to be university\u2019, \u2018affiliating university\u2019, \u2018unitary university\u2019 etc. HEI will be restructured into three types:\nResearch universities focus equally on research and teaching.\nUniversities focus primarily on teaching.\nColleges focus only on teaching at undergraduate levels.\nAll such institutions will gradually move towards full autonomy.\nEstablishing a National Research Foundation (NRF):\nTotal investment in research and innovation in India has declined from 0.84% of GDP in 2008 to 0.69% in 2014. India also lags behind many nations in the number of researchers, patents, and publications.\nNRF will act as an autonomous body for funding, mentoring, and building the capacity for quality research.\nMoving towards a liberal approach:\nUndergraduate programs should be made interdisciplinary by redesigning their curriculum to include: a common core curriculum; and one/two area(s) of specialization.\nIntroduce four-year undergraduate programs in Liberal Arts.\nBy the next five years, five Indian Institutes of Liberal Arts must be set up as model multidisciplinary liberal arts institutions.\nProfessional development of faculty:\nPoor service conditions and heavy teaching loads, augmented by a lack of autonomy and no clear career progression system, have resulted in low faculty motivation.\nIntroduction of a Continuous Professional Development program and permanent employment track system for faculty in all higher education institutions by 2030.\nThe student-teacher ratio of not more than 30:1 must be ensured.\nOptimal learning environment:\nAll higher education institutions must have complete autonomy on curricular, pedagogical, and resource-related matters.\n\nRead: Institutions of Eminence Scheme\n\nAdditional Key Focus Areas:\n\nAdditional key focus areas are (1) Technology in Education (2) Vocational Education (3) Adult Education and (4) the Promotion of Indian Languages.\n\nTECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION\nTechnology plays an important role in:\nImproving the classroom process of teaching, learning, and evaluation\nAiding teacher training.\nImproving access to education.\nImproving the overall planning, administration, and management of the entire education system.\nElectrification of all educational institutions paves the way for technology induction.\nNational Mission on Education through ICT:\nAn autonomous body, the National Education Technology Forum, set up under the Mission, will facilitate decision-making on the use of technology.\nNational Repository on Educational Data: maintain all records related to institutions, teachers, and students in digital form.\nSingle online digital repository to make available copyright-free educational resources in multiple languages.\nVOCATIONAL EDUCATION\nLess than 5% of the workforce in the age group of 19-24 receives vocational education in India, in contrast to 52% in the USA, 75% in Germany and 96% in South Korea.\nNational Policy on Skills Development and Entrepreneurship (2015) aimed at offering vocational education in 25% of educational institutions. The policy expands this to include all educational institutions in a phased manner over 10 years.\nVocational courses: All school students must receive vocational education in at least one vocation in grades 9 to 12.\nHigher Education Institutions must offer vocational courses that are integrated into undergraduate education programs.\nThe draft Policy targets to offer vocational education to up to 50% of the total enrolment in higher education institutions by 2025, up from the present level of enrolment of below 10%.\nNational Committee for the Integration of Vocational Education for charting out plans for the above objectives.\nADULT EDUCATION\n\nAs per Census 2011, India had a total of 26.5 crore adult non-literate (15 years and above).\n\nEstablishing an autonomous\u00a0Central Institute of Adult Education as a constituent unit of NCERT. It will develop a National Curriculum Framework for adult education.\nAdult Education Centers will be included within the school complexes.\nRelevant courses are made available at the National Institute of Open Schooling.\nNational Adult Tutors Programme to build a cadre of adult education instructors and managers.\n\nRead:\u00a0 New India Literacy Programme (NILP)\n\nEDUCATION AND INDIAN LANGUAGES\nThe medium of instruction must be the mother tongue until grade 5, and preferably until grade 8.\n3 language formula be continued and flexibility in the implementation of the formula should be provided. Implementation of the formula needs to be strengthened, particularly in Hindi-speaking states. Schools in Hindi-speaking areas should also teach Indian languages from other parts of India for national integration.\nTo promote Indian languages, a National Institute for Pali, Persian, and Prakrit will be set up.\nThe mandate of the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology will be expanded to include all fields and disciplines to strengthen vocabulary in Indian languages.\nTransforming Education\n\nThe policy talked about the synergistic functioning of India\u2019s education system, to deliver equity and excellence at all levels, from vision to implementation, led by a new Rashtriya Shiksha Aayog.\n\nEDUCATION GOVERNANCE\n\nRevitalize education governance by bringing in synergy and coordination among the different ministries, departments, and agencies.\n\nConstitute the National Education Commission or Rashtriya Shiksha Aayog, as an apex body for education headed by the Prime Minister. It would be responsible for developing, implementing, evaluating, and revising the vision of education and overseeing the implementation and functioning of bodies including the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), National Higher Education Regulatory Authority, and National Research Foundation.\nThe Ministry of Human Resources and Development must be renamed the Ministry of Education to bring the focus back on education.\nFINANCING EDUCATION\nThe Draft Policy reaffirmed the commitment to spending 6% of GDP as a public investment in education.\nThe draft Policy seeks to double the public investment in education from the current 10% of total public expenditure to 20% in the next 10 years. 5% will be utilized for higher education, 2% in school education, and 1.4% for early childhood care and education.\nThere should be optimal and timely utilization of funds through the institutional development plans and by plugging loopholes in the disbursement of funds.\nCriticism of the New Education Policy of India\nThe New Education Policy lacks operational details.\nIt is not clear from where the funding will be sourced.\nEnough importance is not given to innovation, startup culture or economic principles to be added to the curriculum.\nOne-size-fits for all states can\u2019t be a solution as each state in India is diverse in its educational needs. Controversy on NEET has shown this.\nWith technological advancement and the democratization of knowledge, the policy should have focused more on how to teach rather than what to teach.\nEconomic Survey 2017-18 mentioned the perils of the distinction between research institutions and universities in higher education. The policy recommendation of three distinct higher education institutions of research universities, teaching universities, and teaching colleges will further augment the gap between research and universities.\nThe draft policy is silent on the Institutions of Eminence and agencies like the Higher Education Funding Agency.\nThe role of Rashtriya Shiksha Aayog should be defined clearly. What would be its role vis-a-vis existing regulators? Also, there are criticisms from some quarters that RSA will open the door to the politicization of education.\nEarlier the 3-language formula proposed by the draft policy made Hindi compulsory in non-Hindi speaking states. However, after the furor, the proposal was removed.\nEven though the policy talks about bringing \u201cunrepresented groups\u201d into school and focusing on educationally lagging \u201cspecial education zones\u201d, it doesn\u2019t comprehensively address the inequalities prevalent in the system. It misses methods to bridge the gaps between rich and poor children.\nThe policy proposes to remove the provision mandating that primary schools be within stipulated distance from students\u2019 homes and common minimum infrastructure and facility standards that should be met by all schools. If a common minimum standard is not specified, it will create an environment where quality in some schools will fall further thus augmenting the inequalities between schools across the country.\n\nIndia\u2019s education history is rich with ambitious policies failing at the altar of inadequate implementation of the same. In the absence of a handholding mechanism for states to embark on the path-breaking reforms mentioned in the policy and that too in a short time, will be too much to ask.\n\nFunding requirements and governance architecture pose major challenges in the implementation of the policy. Political commitment is required to increase funding. RTE Act expansion to include preschool should keep in mind the present infrastructure inadequacies and teacher vacancies.\n\nRashtriya Shiksha Aayog may face administrative problems and turf battles. Also, it will raise questions on the role of new bodies like the National Medical Council.\n\nThe recent controversy on 3 language formula shows the sensitivity of language education in India and care should be taken to appreciate the emotional overtures while implementing the same.\n\nPolitically acceptability, social desirability, technological feasibility, financial viability, administratively doability, and judicially tenability are 6 pillars that will impact the implementation of the policy.\n\nBe that as it may, the new education policy aims to address the challenges of (i) access, (ii) equity, (iii) quality, (iv) affordability, and (v) accountability faced by the current education system. It aims to revitalize and equip the education system to meet the challenges of the 21st century and 4th industrial revolution rather than catering to 19th and 20th century needs of industrialization. Also, India is on the cusp of a demographic dividend, rather than entered into this phase. So the education system catering to these needs is not a luxury that we hope for but rather a dire need at this moment in Indian history.\n\nThe Problems associated with the Education System in India\n\nHRD ministry: Over 1.4 million schools and 50,000 higher educational institutions are operating in India. Out of 907 universities, there are 399 state universities, 126 deemed-to-be universities, 48 central and 334 private universities.\n\nEven after more than a hundred years of \u201cGokhale\u2019s Bill\u201d1911, where universal primary education was originally mooted, India is yet to achieve this goal.\nChina had achieved it in the 1970s. As per Census 2011, over 26% of India\u2019s population is still illiterate, compared to 4% in China. About 50% of India\u2019s population has only primary education or less, compared to 38% in China. The 13% of the population with tertiary education at the upper end in India is comparable with China.\nHowever, according to Educational Statistics at a Glance (ESAG) 2018, the thrust on providing primary education has yielded results across social and gender categories in the Gross Enrolment Rate (GER).\nProgress has been made in respect of female participation up to secondary level and GER for girls has exceeded that of boys.\nBut the girl\u2019s enrollment rate is lower than that of boys at the higher education level.\nA gap is visible across social categories in terms of enrollment rate at the higher education level.\nAccording to NSSO\u2019s 71st round (2014), drop-out rates are very high for boys at the secondary school level. Reasons for the same are economic activities, lack of interest in education, and financial constraints.\nThe transition rate from secondary school to senior secondary and further to higher education is very low.\n\nDespite these highly ambitious education policies and elaborate deliberations on the same, the outcomes are rather shaky. Major criticisms and shortcomings of these policies and their implementations are:\n\nElitist bias in the implementation of education policies is reflected in the top-heavy structure of India\u2019s education profile, neglecting basic education and prioritizing higher education.\u00a0The ratio of per-student public expenditure at the tertiary level is high relative to the primary level in India.\nHalf the population is crowded at the bottom, either illiterate or with only primary education. Meanwhile, a disproportionately large segment is at the upper end with tertiary education.\nPoor\u00a0quality of education.\nThe 2015 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)reflects this deteriorating quality. The report opines that deficits in foundational reading and arithmetic skills are\u00a0cumulative, which leaves students grossly\u00a0handicapped for further education.\nIndia had fared poorly in the Programme for International Student Assessment\u00a0(PISA) test in 2008, and 09.\nEducation policies in India are focused on inputs rather than on learning outcomes.\nIssues with teachers\nTeacher\u00a0shortages.\nLocal politics.\nCorruption in teacher appointment.\nDefects in teacher training.\nSocio-cultural factors like caste division, and cynical attitude towards the teaching profession.\nThe incentive structure for government school teachers is highly skewed, guaranteeing poor performance.\nThere is no accountability, as there is a guaranteed lifetime job independent of performance.\nInadequate public spending.\nFrom 1952-2012, education expenditure as a percentage of total government expenditure increased from 7.92 to 11.7, and as a percentage of GDP increased from 0.64 to 3.31. But it has still not reached 6% of GDP, as was recommended by the Kothari Commission way back in 1964.\nExpenditure by the government on elementary education is more than tertiary level, but expenditure per student is more in tertiary. So there is a need to increase expenditure in all segments.\nNon-inclusive and in-equitable education system.\nAll India survey on higher education has shown that in West Bengal Muslim students in universities are very low. Lack of education at the primary and secondary levels is said to be the main reason.\nEven though Article 15(4),(5) provides reservations for SC, ST, and OBC in higher education institutions, the Economic Survey 2018-19 points out their inadequate representation in these institutions.\nThe suicide of Rohit Vemula, a Ph.D. scholar at the University of Hyderabad, in 2016 had brought forward the discrimination still existing in these institutions.\nAlso, the representation of teachers at these levels is skewed against the backward class in spite of reservations. Article 16(4) provides for reservations of backward class in jobs.\nThe rich-poor divide is also visible at all levels of the education system.\nAt the school level, poor children are primarily concentrated in government schools. The poor quality of government schools thus disproportionately affects these children and creates a vicious cycle of illiteracy.\nAt the higher education level, the situation is more critical. One reason for the introduction of the National Medical Commission Bill is to curb the exorbitant fees charged by medical colleges.\nThe inadequate employable skills of youth in India.\nYouths coming out of the higher education system in India are not employable, as they lack relevant industry-level skills.\nIndia\u2019s long-standing neglect of primary and secondary education has limited access to quality basic education. No skill development program can succeed without an underlying foundation of basic education.\nNational Policy on\u00a0Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015(PMKVY) has shown disappointing results.\nBudget 2019-20\u00a0stated that the government enables about 10 million youth to take up industry-relevant skill training through the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). The\u00a0 Budget has also increased focus on\u00a0\u2018new-age skills\u2019\u00a0like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, 3D Printing, Virtual Reality, and Robotic.\nCurrently, B Tech courses in AI are offered mostly in premier institutions only.\nSports education is a grossly neglected area in the Indian education scenario. Even today sports education is considered a luxury in India.\nThe budget 2019-20 proposed the National Sports Education Board for the development of sportspersons under the\u00a0Khelo India program (2017).\n\nNow we will look at each rung of the education ladder in India.\n\nEarly childhood education\nEarly childhood education (ECE) is needed for\u00a0cognitive development in the early stage.\nIntegrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS)\u00a0has a component for providing ECE through Anganwadis. But lack of effective\u00a0regulation in this sector is eroding the quality of ECE.\nThere is a National Early Childhood Care and Education Policy 2013. However, the policy has not been properly implemented.\nThere are multiple service providers but there is no clarity in the types of services provided.\nThe sprawling of an unregulated private channel, both organized and unorganized, which is also spreading to rural areas, has led to inequitable access, uneven quality, and commercialization of ECE.\nBoth Anganwadis and private schools focus on reading, writing, and arithmetic rather than cognitive and conceptual development.\nThere is a decline in the quality and training of teachers.\nS.R. Subramanian\u2019s committee report has brought focus to the quality deterioration in this sector.\nPrimary level\nThere is an increasing trend of parents choosing private schools for the primary level. However, there is variable quality in private schools. Also, fees vary from school to school and are on the higher side.\nEschew rigid curricula and make them more cognitive and flexible. There should be a broader cognitive approach than rote learning.\nThere is a need for activity-based learning. Teachers should teach at the right level, rather than teaching for the average learner.\nThe government has launched Padhe Bharat Bade Bharat \u2013\u00a0targeting early reading and writing. The twin-track\u00a0approach of comprehension and math is the main focus.\nThere is a supply-side problem. The government is pumping funds through government schools thus increasing the number of schools and thus enrollment. However, quality and inclusiveness have dropped and dropout rates increased. These lead to poor learning outcomes.\nSCHOOL COMPLEX\nRTE and SSA have resulted in over-access but low-quality primary-level education. Now the aim should be to integrate these into school complexes, as mentioned by the Kasturirangan committee report, thus rationalizing the number of schools in an area.\nThe \u2018Adarsh\u2019 integrated school system of Rajasthan is an example of a school complex system. Here one school provides classes from l to XII under one principal. There is one such school in every gram panchayat.\nThis is an efficient way to solve teacher shortages and also to address the shortages of secondary schools. It can also address the problem of resource scarcity by integrating and rationalizing resources.\nInclusive learning can be furthered through school.\nAlso, these complexes can act as a pivot around which new reforms in education can be implemented.\nSecondary level\n\nASER Rural 2017: In 2017, ASER changed the age group of the survey from primary level to secondary level. The report mentions the following:\n\nEnrollment is low in this age group. There is a high digital divide at this level. Low quality also persists at this level. There is a high amount of absenteeism as well.\nThere is a need to expand RTE to cover the 14-18 age groups.\nTo realize the demographic dividend, skill education for these groups is necessary.\n\nEconomic Survey 2018-19 points out that Indian demography is changing and it requires more quality secondary education system rather than merely an increasing number of primary-level schools.\n\nPRIVATE FEES\nThere is an arbitrary hike in private school fees. Supreme Court in Islamic Academy of Education vs Karnataka 2003\u00a0had said that there is autonomy for private schools to raise fees.\u00a0A reasonable surplus can be generated by schools for the expansion of the institution; however, a balance between the autonomy of the institution and measures to prevent the commercialization of education is needed.\nThe vagueness in the judgment regarding \u2018reasonable surplus\u2019 and \u2018commercialization\u2019 of education has watered down the outcome of the judgment.\nThere are state laws for capping fees. However, implementation problems and litigation make them ineffective.\nCAG report mentioned misreporting and mismanagement by private schools. So laws should address this problem through stricter inspection, penalties, etc.\nHigher education\n\nThere is an increasing number of higher education institutions but their quality is questionable, effectively making \u2018islands of excellence amidst the sea of mediocrity. Increased accessibility to a low-quality higher education system has made democratization of mediocrity.\n\nRaghuram Rajan, the ex-RBI governor, argued that India needs idea factories and universities by leveraging India\u2019s inherent strengths like tolerance, diversity, etc. He said that there is a need for strong accreditation agencies and continuing education.\n\nProblems of the higher education system in India\n\nThere is a dual problem of both quality and quantity. The gross enrollment ratio (GER) in higher education is only 24.5.\nEven though education policy had an elitist bias in favor of higher education, the state of the same is much worse than the state of school education. Unlike school education, there is no national survey of the learning levels of college students.\nThe desired levels of research and internationalization of Indian campuses remain weak points.\nThere is a lack of adequate funds allotted to higher education.\nAlso, there is a low philanthropic investment in this sector. This creates an exclusive dependency on government funding by universities. This, in turn, reduces the autonomy and vision of these universities.\nPrivatization of higher education has not been led by philanthropy but the commercial interest that does not have a symbiotic relationship with the vision of universities.\nThese have led to inadequate human capacity, shoddy infrastructure, and weak institutions. Recommendations of the Narayana Murthy committee,\u00a0on the role of the corporate sector in higher education, have not been implemented and thus channeling of CSR funds to higher education remains inadequate.\nBanks and financial institutions are not giving adequate attention to this area. Giving PSL status to these institutions can be considered.\nIndian higher education system is of a linear model with very little focus on specialization.\nThe regulatory environment of higher education is in shambles.\nUGC and AICTE act more as controllers of education than facilitators.\nDue to the mushrooming of colleges at a higher rate since the 1980s, there is a regulatory sprawl in higher education.\nPoor governance, with mindless\u00a0over-regulation, is widespread in this sector. Educational institutions responded to this with claims of academic and institutional autonomy for themselves, which was mostly a smokescreen for a culture of sloth in these institutions.\nThere is a concentration of powers, as these regulatory institutions control all aspects like accreditation, curriculum setting, professional standard-setting, funding, etc.\nYashpal Committee\u00a02010points out several problems in higher education in India:\nCompartmentalization and fragmentation of the knowledge system.\nDisconnect with society.\nOveremphasis on entrance tests.\nAbsence of innovation in learning methods.\nCorrosion of autonomy of universities.\nFor long basic disciplines across the physical and social sciences and humanities were ignored.\nThere was an increasing trend of bright students choosing foreign institutes over Indian institutes for higher studies. This resulted in a \u2018brain drain\u2018.\nHowever, the Economic Survey 2017-18 mentioned that there is an increase in Ph.D. enrolment in India in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) due to efforts by the government to increase the number and quantum of fellowships. However, there are still fewer researchers in India in comparison to other countries.\nBudget 2019-20 proposes \u2018Study in India\u2019\u00a0with a focus on bringing foreign students to higher educational institutions in India to make India a \u201chub of higher education.\u201d\nHigher education institutions are used as rewards for loyalists and channels of graft by political parties in power.\nIndian higher education system is plagued by unregulated and shoddy coaching institutions. The coaching industry makes around Rs. 24000 crores a year in India. Proper regulation of the same is required.\nResearch and development (R&D)\n\nEconomic Survey 2017-18 stated: \u201cTo transform from net consumer to net producer of knowledge, India should invest in educating its youth in science and mathematics, reform the way R&D is conducted, engage the private sector and the Indian diaspora, and take a more mission-driven approach in areas such as dark matter, genomics, energy storage, agriculture, and mathematics and cyber-physical systems\u201d.\n\nAlthough Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) is consistently increasing, as a fraction of GDP it has been stagnant between 0.6-0.7\u00a0 percent of GDP over the past two decades.\nThe universities play a relatively small role in the research activities in India. There is a disconnection between research institutes and universities. This results in the compartmentalization of research activities and teaching into two separate silos.\nThe\u00a0separation of research from teaching leads to a situation where universities\u00a0have students but need additional faculty support, while research institutes have qualified faculty but are starved of young students.\nIndia was, at one point, spending more on R&D as a percentage of GDP than countries like China \u2013 but currently, India under-spends on R&D.\nDoubling of R&D spending is necessary and much of the increase should come from the private sector and universities.\nTHE NEED OF THE HOUR\nIt is imperative to improve math and cognitive skills at the school level to make a difference at a higher level.\nThere is a need to expand R&D in India and to go beyond paper presentations and patents to a broader contribution of providing value for society.\nThere is also a need to encourage Investigator-led Research for funding science research.\u00a0Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) 2008,\u00a0a statutory body of DST, is a step in the right direction.\nIncrease funding for research from the private sector as well as from state governments. The private sector should be incentivized to both undertake more R&D and support STEM research through CSR funds.\n50:50 partnerships with SERB for industry-relevant research under the Ucchatar Avishkar Yojana (UAY) is the right way to go forward.\nIt would strengthen state universities and provide knowledge in areas specific to a state.\nNational Research Foundation,\u00a0to fund, coordinate, and promote research at the college level, is proposed by the Kasturirangan report. It is reiterated in Budget 2019-20: NRF will ensure the overall research ecosystem in the country is strengthened with a focus on areas relevant to national priorities without duplication of effort and expenditure. The funds available with all Ministries will be integrated into NRF.\nLink national labs to universities and create new knowledge ecosystems. Together they can link up with the commercial sectors and help develop industrial clusters.\nTake a mission-driven approach to R&D \u2013 focus on a few key areas like:\nNational Mission on Dark Matter\nNational Mission on Genomics\nNational Mission on Energy Storage Systems\nNational Mission on\u00a0Mathematics\nNational Mission on Cyber-Physical Systems\nNational Mission on Agriculture\nLeverage the rich scientific\u00a0diaspora\u00a0that India possesses. The growing strength of India\u2019s economy and the growing anti-immigrant atmosphere in some Western countries provide a good opportunity to attract back more scientists. Government programs for the same include:\nRamanujan Fellowship Scheme.\nInnovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) Faculty Scheme.\nRamalingaswami Re-entry Fellowship.\nVisiting Advanced Joint Research Faculty Scheme (VAJRA).\nImprove the culture of research thus \u2018ease of doing research\u2019. There is a need for less hierarchical governance systems that encourage risk-taking and curiosity in the pursuit of excellence.\nGreater public engagement of the science and research establishment is needed. A greater effort at science communication\u00a0is needed.\nGovernment initiatives on higher education\n\nThe government is trying to revitalize the Indian higher education system and for this many initiatives have been launched. Let\u2019s discuss the importance of them.\n\nNational Testing Agency (NTA) 2017\nNTA was set up for conducting entrance exams in higher educational institutions. It is based on the recommendations of the Ashok Mishra committee on IIT entrance 2015.\nIt will conduct JEE, NEET, National Eligibility Test (NET), Common Management Admission Test (CMAT), and Graduate Pharmacy Aptitude Test (GPAT).\nIt will provide diversity and plurality in higher education. It will also ensure independence and transparency in conducting the exams.\nHowever, it should be ensured that the computer-based test should not lead to further exploitation of rural students.\nNEET\nNEET stands for National Eligibility cum Entrance Test. It is for admissions in medical courses by replacing a plethora of medical entrance tests with one national-level test.\nSupreme Court had said that NEET should be the sole basis for admission to medical courses.\nThere is a controversy about whether urban and CBSE students will dominate NEET. The government should pay heed to this criticism.\nTamil Nadu had claimed that NEET will be difficult for rural and underprivileged children who cannot afford tuition.\nIn Tamil Nadu doctors serving in rural areas get weightage in PG admission. NEET will effectively dislodge this system.\nThis controversy brought forward the conflict between the fair and transparent system of admission to curb the commercialization of medical education and the socioeconomic goals of the state, which in the case of Tamil Nadu includes ensuring enough doctors for rural areas.\nControversy on NEET has brought the following question to the limelight: should uniformity be thrust upon a country with such vast disparity and diversity? The political leadership should iron out the differences and produce a suitable admission policy. This task should not be left to the judiciary.\nBe that as it may, states can\u2019t remain insulated from the need to upgrade their education standard.\nRUSA:\u00a0Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan 2013\nAbout 94% of students in higher education study in 369 State universities, whereas less than 6% of students study in 150 Centrally-funded institutions.\n11th 5-year plan\u00a0(2007-12) opined that the center\u2019s bias towards premier central institutions had skewed funding for these institutions mainly and thus neglected state-level institutions.\nState investment in higher education was declining. UGC\u2019s system of direct release of funds to State institutions bypassing State governments also leads to a sense of alienation for the states.\nRUSA tried to correct this bias. The scheme aims at financing state institutions concerning their governance and performance.\nRUSA has shown the result in increasing the performance of state institutions and changing the way regulators function for the good. State Higher Education Council(SHEC)\u00a0made medium-long-term state perspective plans.\nCabinet in 2018 decided to continue the scheme. A renewed focus by the center on RUSA will be a success only if it is impartially administered and states are willing to heed the advice of SHEC.\nHECI:\u00a0Higher Education Commission of India bill\nOn the recommendation of the Yashpal Committee 2010 for renovation and rejuvenation of higher education, the National Commission on Higher Education and Research bill was introduced but was not passed.\nHECI was proposed to act as an overarching regulator of higher education by replacing UGC, which will maintain academic standards, approve new educational institutions, etc. but with no funding powers.\nDraft Higher Education Commission of India (Repeal of University Grants Commission Act) Bill, 2018 was introduced in 2018. Budget 2019-20 proposed to bring a bill on HECI this year.\nThe draft bill had separated funding and placed it under MHRD. This was criticized for the fear of increasing political control and reducing the autonomy of universities.\nIoE:\u00a0Institutions of Eminence 2017\nAround 2005, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the QS World University Rankings started, and in 2009 the Academic Ranking of World Universities started. From India, only the Indian Institute of Science was included in the top 500 every year. This prompted the government to introduce NIRF and IoE.\nUnder IoE, UGC was tasked to select 10 government universities and 10 private ones as IoE. These would be given autonomy in operations.\nSelected government institutions would be provided with \u20b91,000 crore over five years.\nThe IoE tag is expected to help them achieve the world\u2019s top 500 higher education institutions in a decade and later into the top 100.\nInstitutes among the top 50 in the National Institute Ranking Framework rankings or in the top 500 in international ratings were eligible.\nCriticism\nThe model for the sector remains dependent on state patronage.\nEntry into the global education race could now become an overriding concern when many systemic issues are plaguing the sector.\nFunding only for public institutions is discriminatory.\nHumanities institutions were neglected.\nNeed\nTransparency in the selection process, and the public sharing of benchmarks and guidelines. The furor over the selection of Jio Institute, even before it functioned, had attracted many eyeballs and criticisms.\nSeparate category to include sectoral institutions like IIM.\nNational Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2015\n\nNIRF is a methodology adopted by the\u00a0MHRD to rank higher education\u00a0institutions in India.\n\nNIRF is common for public and private institutions as well as state and central institutions. Comparison of state-level colleges with central and private colleges may lead to a vicious cycle of low funding, poor performance, and low ranks among state-level institutions because of the resource gap.\nSo performance index values should be normalized concerning investments and resources that have gone into that institution. Also should consider making another ranking system for state-level institutions.\nHEFA:\u00a0Higher Education Financing Agency 2018\n\nIntroduced in Budget 2018-19, HEFA is a joint venture of MHRD and Canara Bank\n\nWith an initial capital base of Rs 1,000 crores, it will act as a not-for-profit organization that will leverage funds from the market and supplement them with donations and CSR funds. These funds will be used to finance improvement in infrastructure in top institutions.\nIt has been tasked with raising \u20b91 lakh crore to finance infrastructure improvements in higher education by 2022.\n\u00a0Foreign Education Providers Bill\u00a02013\u00a0\nThere is no account of programs delivered by foreign universities in India. Inadequate regulation has led to low-quality courses offered in this sector.\nThe foreign Institution bill was not been able to pass in Parliament. However,\n\nEQUIP report has mentioned the revival of this bill.\n\nThere are many other schemes and initiatives like SWAYAM, which offers open online courses from Class IX to post-graduation free of cost, GIAN and IMPRINT which are primarily focused on elite institutes like IITs and IISc.\n\nAPAAR: One Nation One Student ID Card\n\nThe Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR) is a transformative initiative introduced in alignment with the National Education Policy (NEP) of 2020 and the National Credit and Qualifications Framework (NCrF).\n\nIt aims to provide a unified and accessible academic experience for students across India by assigning a unique and permanent 12-digit ID to every student, consolidating their academic achievements in one place.\n\nOther Major Issues connected with the Education sector in India\n\nThe Indian education sector is also affected by other issues like the politicization of campuses, gender parity problems, poor-quality standards, etc.\n\nPoliticization of campuses\nJP movement had provided an impetus to the politicization of students.\nIn Indian higher education institutions, university politics has become a launchpad for political ambitions.\nThough campus politics is vital for democracy, as it makes students better citizens, the negative side of the politicization of campuses has been visible across Indian campuses. Recent incidents at Kerala University are a case in point.\nOne of the most important problems of student politics in India is that it acts as an appendage to political parties without having an independent identity or autonomy.\nGender Parity\nThere is a 2 pronged\u00a0gender discrimination in the Indian education system:\nBy parents \u2192 who send boys to private and girls to government schools. Economic Survey 2018-19: enrollment of girls is higher than that of boys in government schools but the pattern gets reversed in private schools. The gender gap in enrollment in private schools has consistently increased across age groups.\nBy teachers \u2192 who reinforced the belief that boys are quick learners.\nGirls are eased out of school to work on home chores or get married.\nThe government has launched Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao,(BPBP), a campaign to generate awareness and improve the efficiency of welfare services intended for girls in India.\nEconomic Survey 2018-19 opines that BBBP has been a success and proposes to extend the cause of Gender equality by coining the slogan of BADLAV (Beti Aapki Dhan Lakshmi Aur Vijay-Lakshmi) to enhance the contribution of women in the workforce and the economy.\nFor ranking states based on gender disparity, Digital Gender Atlas for Advancing Girl\u2019s Education was launched by MHRD.\nThe Gender Parity Index (GPI) in education reflects the discrimination against girls in access to educational opportunities.\nIn higher education, gender disparities still prevail in enrollment.\nEfforts by the Government through programs like Beti Padhao, and Beti Bachao, the GPI has improved substantially at the primary and secondary levels of enrolment.\nQuality of education\n\nLearning outcomes are not assessed in India as numerical outcomes. The 12th Five-Year Plan noted the need for measuring and improving learning outcomes.\n\nChildren of illiterate parents can\u2019t supplement school studies at home and also can\u2019t afford expensive tuition, leading to a vicious cycle of illiteracy.\nASER 2018\nFrom 2014 to 2018, there was a gradual improvement in both basic literacy and numeracy for Class III students but only a quarter of them are at grade level (ability to read and do basic operations like subtraction of Class II level).\nThe report also shows that 1 out of 4 children leaving Class VIII are without basic reading skills (ability to read at least a Class II level).\nGOVERNMENT INITIATIVES\nCentral Rules under the RTE Act were amended in February 2017 to include the defined class-wise and subject-wise learning outcomes.\nPadhe Bharat Badhe Bharat\nNationwide sub-program of SSA to improve comprehensive early reading, writing, and early mathematics programs for children in Classes I and II.\nTEACHER TRAINING\nTeachers play the most critical role in a student\u2019s achievement.\nThe need is for better incentives for teachers, investments in teacher capacity through stronger training programs, and addressing the problems in the teaching-learning process.\nHowever, teachers in India, especially in government schools, are considered a cog in the way to efficient governance. There is an inadequate focus on their motivation and skill updation.\nNCERT study shows that there is no systematic incorporation of teacher feedback into designing pieces of training. Also, there is no mechanism to check whether this training is translated into classroom performance.\nThese results in de-professionalizing the teaching profession and curb a teacher\u2019s \u201cinternal responsibility\u201d\u2014 the sense of duty to the job.\nDIKSHA\nWorld Development Report on Education (2018) opined that both teaching skills and motivation matter. Individually targeted continued training is important. In line with this, MHRD and the National Council for Teacher Education launched the National Teacher Platform, or Diksha in 2017. It is a one-stop solution to address teacher competency gaps.\nHowever, the current training through Diksha follows a one-size-fits-all approach. Even though the platform is designed to democratize both access to and creation of content by teachers, its real benefits are in the ability to provide continuous professional development which complements existing physical training.\nThis technology-enabled platform allows training to become a continuous activity rather than an annual event and also creates a feedback loop ensuring the effectiveness of the material.\nDiksha has the potential to re-engineer in-service teacher training in India. It is important to create good content and also to ensure technology consumption by teachers, the role of headmasters in promoting teachers\u2019 professional development, etc.\n\nAs India participates in the PISA in 2021, it is to be made sure that we recognize the importance of teachers and their role in education outcomes.\n\nPrivate Schools vs Public Schools: The Big Debate in Education\n\nAt least 30% of students between the 6-14 age groups are in the private sector.\n\nThere is an increasing perception that the quality of teaching in private schools is better than that of public schools. Thus there is a clamour for increasing the number of private schools and simultaneously limiting public spending on government schools.\nHowever, the claim on the quality of private schools is debatable as there is a wide disparity of the same among these schools.\n\nResearch paper by Geeta Gandhi Kingdon, professor of education and international development at the Institute of Education, London, offers insights into private-public school education in India:\n\nThe paper points out that between 2010-11 and 2015-16, the average enrolment in government schools declined from 122 to 108 students per school, while in private schools it rose from 202 to 208.\nNevertheless, according to the District Information System for Education (DISE), 65% of all school-going children, 113 million, get their education from government schools.\nThe study points out that the migration to private schools is due to the belief among parents that these schools offer better value for money in terms of quality.\nIndiaSpend, in 2016, reported that despite the Rs 1.16 lakh crore spent on SSA, the quality of learning declined between 2009 and 2014. It also points out that less than one in five elementary school teachers in India are trained. Also, the contractual teachers, who are high in number in government schools, are likely to be less motivated and accountable.\nPreference for private school tutoring is there.\nThe quality of schools varies between states. In 2016, in Kerala, the proportion of children enrolled in primary government schools increased from 40.6% in 2014 to 49.9% according to ASER 2016.\nStates with better-functioning government schools have more expensive private schools as there is no market for the \u2018low-fee\u2019 budget private schools. Around 80% of private schools in India are \u2018low\u2019 fee schools.\nASER 2016 has shown small improvements in learning outcomes in government schools.\nBetween 2010-11 and 2015-16, the number of private schools grew by 35% \u2013 to 0.30 million. On the other hand, the number of government schools grew only by 1%, to 1.04 million. The migration out of government schools has left many of these economically unviable.\nGovernment teachers in India earn four times that of China but don\u2019t perform as well. Up to 80% of India\u2019s public expenditure on education is spent on teachers. There is a need to link teacher salaries to their accountability.\nHowever, the salary of private teachers is very low compared to their government counterparts. This is due to the \u201cbureaucratically-set high \u2018minimum wage\u2019, which is being influenced by strong unions of government school teachers.\nAnother reason for the low salary of private school teachers is that the private education sector offers salaries based on market factors of demand and supply. Since 10.5% of graduates are unemployed in India, there is a high supply of teachers.\nRather than merely increasing the budget outlay for education, the need is to revise the Education policy for better accountability and monitoring mechanisms.\nGandhi argued that a Public-private partnership (PPP) model may be the solution, with public sector funding and private resources for education, since reforming the present system may not be politically feasible.\n\nRather than debating about private versus public schools, the focus should be to\u00a0enable the private sector to set up more schools under the scrutiny of regulatory authorities. There is no point in driving off the private initiative in schooling given the limited resources of the states. Private investment should be encouraged but made accountable for quality and conduct.\n\nThe above discussion showed the challenges of the Indian education system. A workforce that India wants to create in this digital age requires reforms in education at all levels. UNESCO\u2019s Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report 2016 opined that India is expected to achieve universal primary education in 2050. India is 50 years late in achieving its global education commitments. If the nation wants fundamental changes in the education system, it has to meet the 2030 SDG targets on education. There is an urgent requirement for greater evolution in education in India.\n\nEducation Quality Upgradation and Inclusion Programme (EQUIP): How to transform Education in India?\n\nEQUIP is a\u00a0five-year vision plan on education, released by MHRD, by\u00a0the Prime Minister\u2019s decision to create a five-year vision plan for each Ministry.\n\nThe EQUIP project is crafted by ten expert groups led by experts within and outside the government:\n\nGroup 1:\u00a0Strategies for expanding access\nGroup 2:\u00a0Towards global best teaching/learning process\nGroup 3:\u00a0Promoting Excellence\nGroup 4:\u00a0Governance reforms\nGroup 5: Assessment, Accreditation, and Ranking Systems\nGroup 6: Promotion of research and innovation\nGroup 7: Employability and Entrepreneurship\nGroup 8: Using Technology for Better Reach\nGroup 9:\u00a0Internationalisation\nGroup 10: Financing Higher Education\n\nThe groups have suggested initiatives to transform the education system completely. The goals set by the groups are:\n\nDouble GER in higher education and resolve the geographically and socially skewed access to higher education institutions.\nUpgrade the quality of education to global standards.\nPosition at least 50 Indian institutions among the top 1000 global universities.\nIntroduce governance reforms in higher education for well-administered campuses.\nAccreditation of all institutions as an assurance of quality.\nPromote Research and Innovation ecosystems for positioning India in the top three countries in the world in matters of knowledge creation.\nDouble the employability of the students passing out of higher education.\nHarness education technology for expanding the reach and improving pedagogy.\nPromote India as a global study destination.\nAchieve a quantum increase in investment in higher education.\n\nWe can see that each of the above goals has been known to us for a long time. The problem is its implementation. The political class and all other stakeholders should come together to achieve these goals. The plethora of government initiatives on higher education is a sure sign of the importance given by the political class in the reform of the education system of India. Let\u2019s hope that a new dawn of Indian education is around the corner which will bring back the glory of ancient times when India was the centre of knowledge production.\n\nAs the Economic Survey 2016-17 points out, lack of health, malnourishment, etc. affects the cognitive ability of children. This will, in turn, have a detrimental effect on their future educational prospects. This leads to a vicious cycle of inter-generational illiteracy, poor health, and ultimately poverty. So education and health are complementary to each other and reforms in one sector should invariably be preceded and followed by reforms in other sectors. Human development as a whole can be considered as a wholesome development and we must appreciate the interlinkages of each section of human capital formation, be it health, education, digital literacy, skills, etc.\n\nAlso read: PM-USHA\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the larger domain of human capital, education, and skill development have a big role.\n\nCensus 2011 data on literacy gives us a quick perspective on the current status of education. However, education is not just about literacy.\n\nRTE act acts as a cornerstone for Indian education. Nevertheless, it is the various education policies, charted out since Independence, which led to the historical evolution of the education system in India.\n\nThe results of these policies can be said to be mixed. There is still a lot of room for improvement.\n\nThere are various government initiatives targeting each level of the education system in India. The higher Education System is given a greater focus these days.\n\nThe latest update in the education sector is the Kasturirangan report or draft new education policy. It captures the need of the hour for reforming education.\n\nThe modern Indian education system is crying for a revamp. The draft New Education Policy (NEP) is the right moment to take stock of its history, achievements, and misgivings to chart out a futuristic education plan for 21st-century India.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Education in state list: Should it be restored?\n\nArticle by\u00a0Sethu\u00a0Krishnan M, curated by ClearIAS Team",

    "[CONTENT] #651": "As per the current education system in India, all the students up till Class 8 will automatically be promoted to next class. No one can be failed as per the Right to Education Act. This is known as the \u2018No-Detention Policy\u2018.\n\nAn expert committee headed by T S R Subramanian set up to formulate the new National Education Policy had last year recommended that the \u2018No-Detention Policy\u2019 be reviewed and exams are held from Class VI. Recently, Union Cabinet has approved the scrapping of the no-detention policy in schools till Class VIII.\n\nIn this article, we discuss if the no-detention policy should be scrapped from the next academic year. Has the no-detention policy negatively impacted the quality of basic education in the country? Let\u2019s see.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is \u2018No-Detention\u2019 policy?\nThe Right To Education (RTE) Act\nThe RTE Act provides for:\nWhy is the No-Detention Policy reconsidered?\nWhat is the new proposal?\nReasons why \u2018no-detention policy\u2019 is criticized\nReasons why \u2018no-detention policy\u2019 is supported\nWhat is the stand of various states in this regard?\nWill scrapping the no-detention policy solve all problems?\nWay ahead\nConclusion\nWhat is \u2018No-Detention\u2019 policy?\nAs per the No-Detention Policy under the Right to Education Act, no student can be failed or expelled from school till the completion of elementary education covering classes 1 to 8. All the students up till Class 8 will automatically be promoted to next class.\nThe essence of the policy is that children should not be \u2018failed\u2019 and detained up to Class 8. There are no \u201cexaminations\u201d in the narrow traditional sense of the word up to Class 8. Instead, the Act mandates a process of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) to assess and evaluate the student\u2019s learning.\nThe Right To Education (RTE) Act\nThe Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 inserted Article 21-A in the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right in such a manner as the State may, by law, determine.\nIt means that every child has a right to full-time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality in a formal school which satisfies certain essential norms and standards.\nIt came into effect on 1 April 2010.\nThe RTE Act provides for:\nEvery child in the age group of 6-14 has the right to free and compulsory\u00a0education in a neighbourhood school, till the completion of elementary education.\nPrivate schools will have to take 25% of their class strength from the weaker section and the disadvantaged group of the society through a random selection process. The government will fund the education of these children.\nNo donation and capitation fee\u00a0is allowed.\nNo admission test or interview\u00a0either for child or parents.\nNo child can be held back, expelled and required to pass the board examination till the completion of elementary education.\nThere is provision for the establishment of commissions to supervise the implementation of the act.\nA fixed student and teacher ratio\u00a0is to be maintained.\nAll schools have to adhere to rules and regulations laid down in this act, failing which the school will not be allowed to function. Three years moratorium period has been provided to school to implement all that is required of them.\nNorms for teachers training and qualifications\u00a0are also clearly mentioned in the act.\nAll schools except private unaided schools are to be managed by School Management Committees with 75% of parents and guardians as members.\nWhy is the No-Detention Policy reconsidered?\nVarious states, including Delhi, have raised serious objections against the no-detention policy, citing it as a reason of high failure and dropouts in classes 9 and 10.\nAlso, it is criticized that due to no-detention policy, students do not focus much on education as they already have it in their mindset that they will be promoted to the next class even if they don\u2019t perform well.\nWhat is the new proposal?\n\nWhen the no-detention policy is scrapped, an enabling provision will be made in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Amendment Bill which will allow states to detain students in class 5 and class 8 if they fail in the year-end exam.\n\nReasons why \u2018no-detention policy\u2019 is criticized\nNegative impact on the standard of education:\u00a0Most of the schools in interior places are running without any teachers. Hence, if the \u2018no-detention policy\u2019 continues, it will leave a negative impact on the standard of education in India and force the children to face more harsh future.\nNo reward for hard work: This policy has led to students developing a lackadaisical attitude, with there being no risk of failing. It also makes no distinction between good and bad students, and between those who work hard and those who don\u2019t. Thus it makes no effective way to implement a good level of teaching and learning.\nApathy from teachers: With the policy in place, the Education Department does not take steps to revamp itself and the teachers do not take the pain to ensure a good education for the children.\nDark future of students:\u00a0Students coming from poor economic background face problem in their coming life because of no good education in the schools.\nWill affect the women empowerment programs:\u00a0The girls especially will face a major problem if not getting a proper education in the schools.\nZero academic outcomes:\u00a0If no merit is checked while giving promotion to another class, the children will never learn the importance of studying and acquiring knowledge. It will lead to a poor academic outcome in classes.\nReasons why \u2018no-detention policy\u2019 is supported\n\nStemming dropouts from the schools due to peer pressure was the main reason the Right to Education Act included the no-detention provision. If it is reversed, many students would stop going to schools when they fail.\n\nThe section 29 (2) (h) of the RTE Act makes a comprehensive and continuous evaluation (CCE) mandatory, wherein schools are expected to use test results to improve teaching and learning of the child. Unlike traditional board examinations, the CCE visualises evaluation as a diagnostic tool to improve learning. So scrapping the policy is not a solution, in fact, it should be modified and corrected. (Reference: Wikipedia)\nIf a student is made to repeat a grade, there\u2019s a strong chance he or she will discontinue learning. Also, there is no research which establishes that repeating a year helps children perform better. In fact, not much burden helps the child not to take studies as a burden.\nThere can be modifications such as \u2013 each school should conduct exams to ascertain which student is weak in what subject. If the child is weak, the school should take additional classes or special coaching.\nWhat is the stand of various states in this regard?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAll States/UTs were asked to share their views on the No-Detention policy. 28 States have shared their views on the No Detention policy out of which 23 States have suggested a modification to the No Detention policy. \u00a0(Reference: PIB)\n\nWill scrapping the no-detention policy solve all problems?\nFlawed teachers\u2019 training (the eye of many scams), social indifference to the plight of school teachers, rampant use of ad hoc teachers in small towns and villages, etc. have all substantively contributed to a failing school system. Only scrapping the policy is not going to drastically improve the standard of education in the country.\nAccording to some educationists, the policy was wrongly interpreted to create an environment in which the significance of evaluating a school-goer\u2019s learning outcomes was undermined. Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE), that aimed to assess the child\u2019s understanding of what was being taught in class at periodic intervals, proved to be a non-starter in many schools. The policy alone cannot be blamed for poor results.\nThe teachers were not given adequate training to undertake this reform. They had no idea of what was to be evaluated, and how. In several schools, CCE was reduced to \u201cproject work\u201d, which parents resented. The RTE\u2019s provisions regarding the upgrading of school infrastructure and an increase in the teacher-student ratio \u2014 that would have created an enabling environment for the policy \u2014 were given a short shrift. Hence, the poor performance can be linked to a variety of other factors rather than just the no detention policy.\nWay ahead\nThe phenomenon of poor learning outcomes is the product of many\u00a0factors which influence learning, and should not be conveniently pinned to the door of\u00a0the no-detention policy. The steps that can be taken to improve learning outcomes can be:\nmeasuring learning level outcomes of all children on a regular basis,\ncatalysing a \u201cperformance-driven culture\u201d and rewarding high performers at every level,\nchanging stakeholders\u2019 mindset and preparing them for new provisions, in which parents were made responsible or accountable for full attendance of their children.\nThe policy should be implemented in a phased manner and a scale-up to all classes should be undertaken only after the critical infrastructural, teacher strength and teachers\u2019 skill-set requirements were fully met.\nConclusion\n\nRather than addressing the core issues that affect the quality of education in the country, the entire focus seems to be shifting to bring back the pass/fail model.\nA greater level of seriousness on all sides is the need of the hour. It is high time steps are taken to remove the other flaws that exist.\nHence, the policy should either be renovated with adequate changes to neutralize the ill effects or replaced with a new policy that would take a balanced approach. The prime objective should be to effect an all-round development of children and equipping them with life skills.\n\nArticle by: Pooja Chaudhary",

The doctor-population ratio\u00a0is far lower than prescribed by World Health Organisation (one for every 1,674 persons, as per the parliamentary panel report, against the WHO-recommended one to 1,000).\n\nMedical Council of India (MCI)\n\nManagement of medical education in India should take the major responsibility of such a paradoxical trend. Medical Council of India (MCI) is the regulatory body for medical education and medical practices in India. Many blame MCI for problems in the India health sector.\u00a0The solution to this situation lies mainly in reforming and revamping MCI.\n\nHowever, Medical Council of India (MCI) has conducted many studies to identify the problems the medical field (Eg: Vision 2015 Report).\n\nVision 2015 report of MCI\n\nMCI published a vision document, in which it has analyzed problems of healthcare sector and reforms needed to resolve them.\n\n3 main reasons for India\u2019s healthcare woes:\nShortage of physicians\u00a0(both generalists and specialists).\nInequitable distribution of manpower and resources.\nDeficiencies in the quality of medical education.\nProposed reforms:\nIncrease production of doctors.\nReform curriculum by a transition from a science-based curriculum to skills and competency-based curriculum.\nThere is a need to emphasis on primary health care and family medicine.\nMedical institutions should be\u00a0strengthened by investing in technology.\n\nThe final goal of the vision document is to produce world-class Indian doctors. Needless to say, this vision remained a mere vision, even in 2018, without any marked improvement in ground reality.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Problems of Medical Education in India\n\nMedical education in India faces many issues, some of which are identified in the vision document. Most important of them are:\n\n1. Inter-state and intra-state\u00a0inequality in the distribution of manpower and resources\nThere is a huge disparity in availability of opportunities for students across states.\n2010 report by MHRD had stated that four states \u2013 Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu \u2013 account for 1.3 lakh out of 2.4 lakh medical seats across India.\nThere is also a glaring rural-urban disparity in both availabilities of health care and colleges.\nA blanket standard for starting a medical college leads to neglect of states like Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland etc. and rural areas.\nAmidst this situation, new medical colleges can bring in uniformity of access across sates and fill the demand-supply gap.\n2. Low doctor-population ratio\u00a0\nOne of the reasons for this low ratio is that only low number of medical graduates are passing out each year. Reasons include:\nAs MBBS students are unable to find jobs, they are forced to specialize in a particular field leading to a Super-Specialty craze.\nBrain drain to developed countries is also one of the reasons for unavailability of doctors in India.\nMCI regulations prevent experienced MBBS doctors from carrying out procedures like cesareans and ultrasound tests. Experienced nurses are barred from administering anaesthesia. This leads to failure of utilizing the experienced manpower to increase the service delivery.\nThis shortage of doctors is largely affected by rural health care.\u00a0\nAnother casualty of the Super-specialty craze is Research and teaching, as no one is choosing research or teaching as their preferred career.\n\nSingle breed of doctors can\u2019t cater to all the needs, especially in a country as diverse as India. So medical colleges should sensitize students about all the available opportunities and the attached perks and perils. This will introduce various options available to the students to explore and choose the field best applicable to them.\n\n3. Deficiencies in the quality of medical education\nThere is no uniformity in selection students to medical colleges. A common entrance test at all India level is required to ensure this uniformity.\nBreakthroughs are frequent in the medical field, but syllabus is not updated adequately reflecting these new trends in the medical field.\nLack of skilled teachers has afflicted all the educational paradigms of India. In the medical field, this issue is more critical. Here teachers are selected based on academic knowledge rather than clinical experience and adequate training is not imparted to them. Inadequate salary to teachers is also the main problem that makes this profession unattractive.\nNo uniform quality standards of graduating doctors across India. There should be an exit test, that will bring parity to standards graduating from all medical colleges across India.\n4. Lack of social accountability\nThe medical profession is unique as it requires an amount of social responsibility and societal empathy. Newly graduated doctors are unaware or indifferent to their social responsibility. Colleges play a major role in infusing the young students with an empathetic attitude towards society. But instead, they are encouraging rot learning without the consideration of humanitarian dimension. Hippocratic oath is largely morphing into hypocrisy.\n5. The recognition issue of foreign degrees\nMCI recognizes only a few medical courses from foreign universities. This becomes difficult for foreign graduated students to start practising in India.\n6. Unregulated private colleges\nChange in rules brought about after the reforms of the 1990s made it easier to open private colleges. This has increased the number of medical colleges but leads to many undesired consequences.\nThis commercialization of medical education had a profound impact on quality of graduate doctors, as anyone with money can buy seats in these colleges.\nMCI was incompetent to deal with this influx of commercialization and capitation fee skyrocketed, leading to\u00a0corruption\u00a0and black money circulation.\nThus sanctity of education was lost as medical education became a field for unscrupulous practice and profit gain than imparting education and providing quality doctors. This has resulted in an unhealthy competition which in-turn lead to unreasonable medical practices and unwarranted diagnostics as graduates from these institutions wanted to recover their capitation fees at the earliest. Eventually, this leads to complete crowding out of the societal and humanitarian dimension of medical education from colleges.\nMedical Council of India (MCI) \u2013 History | Objectives | Issues\n\nIndian education system is regulated by Medical Council of India. From setting standards of education to approving colleges and setting ethical guidelines for doctors, are vested in this single institution. So the working of the same will be the main determinant of the success of medical education in India. Given the maladies of the medical education system, an overhaul of MCI is the first and foremost step of rescuing the medical system from its current rot.\n\nHistory of MCI\nMCI is a statutory body for establishing uniform and high standards of medical education in India.\nIt was established in 1934 under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1933. It later reconstituted under the\u00a0Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.\nBut the controversy over corruption plagued the institution as it was dissolved by the President of India in 2010 following the arrest of MCI\u2019s president Ketan Desai under the Prevention of Corruption Act.\nIt was then reconstituted in 2013. After several committee reports and court orders, the government introduced National Medical Council bill in 2018.\nObjectives of MCI\nMaintenance of uniform standards of medical education, for both undergraduate and postgraduate courses.\nRecommendation for recognition/de-recognition of medical qualifications of medical institutions of India or foreign countries.\nPermanent registration/provisional registration of doctors with recognized medical qualifications.\nReciprocity with foreign countries in the matter of mutual recognition of medical qualifications.\nIssues of MCI\nSeparation of regulatory powers\nThe council regulates medical education as well as medical practice leading to the centralization of all regulatory functions in one single body.\nThere should be a separation between the regulation of medical education from regulation of medical practice. Expert committee- Ranjit Roy committee\u00a02014\u00a0\u2013recommended structural re-configuration of the council by separation of power.\nComposition of MCI\nMost of the members of the MCI are elected.\nNITI Aayog Committee (2016) noted that there will be a conflict of interest if members are elected. Because if the regulator is elected by the same fraternity that it would monitor, it will become ineffective and also prevents the entry of skilled professionals for the job. The Committee recommended the appointment of regulators through an independent selection process than elections.\nFee Regulation\nMCI is authorized for fee regulation of private colleges.\nNITI Aayog Committee (2016)\u00a0recommended against this practice as it will lead to corruption and increased capitation fees. Fee cap will discourage the entry of genuine private colleges, limiting the expansion of medical education in the country. Disallowing for-profit medical education has driven profit-taking underground with various kinds of inventive fee structures by medical colleges.\nProfessional conduct\nStanding Committee on Health (2016)\u00a0observed that the present focus of the MCI is only on licensing of medical colleges and no emphasis given to the enforcement of medical ethics in education and on instances of corruption noted within the MCI.\nCommittee recommended that the areas of medical education and medical practice should be separated in terms of enforcement of the appropriate ethics for each of these stages.\n\nThus, now MCI has evolved into a body that has become a powerful rationing authority, controlled by those who it is supposed to be regulating, that is powerful medical colleges and medical professionals.\n\nVarious Committees on Medical Education in India\n1. Ranjit Roy committee\u00a02014\n\nAmidst these crises, the government appointed a high power committee under the chairmanship of Ranjith Roy to look into the issue comprehensively and recommend reforms. Thus the committee has given recommendations, which form the basis of current restructuring of medical education in India. Important recommendations are:\n\nAn\u00a0umbrella body \u2013\u00a0National Medical Commission (NMC) should be constituted through a new act\nNational Medical Commission should have an Appellate Tribunal and four independent and autonomous boards viz.\nUnder-Graduate medical Education Board (UGMEB),\nPost-Graduate Medical Education Board (PGMED),\nMedical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB)\nEthics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB).\nSteps to be taken to decrease the cost of medical education in India.\nRegional\u00a0accessibility should be\u00a0increased.\nDoctor to patient ratio should be increased.\nCommon entrance exam should be conducted.\n\nA parliamentary committee to overhaul MCI was constituted to study Ranjith Roy committee report.\n\n2. Parliamentary standing committee to overhaul MCI 2016 \u2013\u00a0Prof Ram Gopal Yadav\n\nMajor observations of the committee are:\n\nThe committee called MCI a \u201cclub\u201d of influential medical practitioners who act without any fear of government and regulations.\nThere was widespread corruption in granting approval for setting up medical colleges and prevalence of \u2018random\u2019 and opaque inspections as a scrupulous method for corruption.\nThe committee finds MCI as responsible for the prevailing pathetic state of health care and low standard of conduct of medical practitioners and hospitals.\nIt opined that the composition of MCI neither represent professional excellence nor follows medical ethos. More than half of the members are either from corporate hospitals or in private practice, carrying out unnecessary diagnostic tests and surgical procedures and flouting government rules and regulations, especially about treating patients from underprivileged backgrounds.\n\nThe committee asked the government to implement Prof Ranjit Roy Chaudhury committee. The government has introduced NEET exam as a common entrance test from 2016. But on other recommendations, government dragged its feet. Supreme Court ordered an oversight committee under Justice Lodha. Thus the inefficiency of government or executive paved the way for judicial activism.\n\n3. Oversight committee under Justice Lodha 2016\n\nSupreme Court set up an oversight committee under Justice Lodha while\u00a0endorsing\u00a0Parliamentary standing committee report, through\u00a0Article 142,\u00a0to bring in transparency and accountability within the MCI and oversee its statutory functioning. But a turf war between the Supreme court established the oversight committee and MCI hindered reform measures Then the government-appointed a team of five eminent doctors to oversee the medical regulatory body as the 1-year mandate of oversight committee ended.\n\nNational Medical Council Bill 2018 \u2013 Concerns and Solutions\n\nThus we have seen that there are many maladies in medical education in India, most of which roots back to the inefficient functioning of the regulator, the MCI. After a parliamentary committee report and an oversight committee by the Supreme Court, finally, the government have introduced a new bill, titled National Medical Council 2018. It\u00a0is\u00a0currently being debated in parliament. As the bill is being debated, we will look into the issues that are needed to be addressed in the bill:\n\n#Issue 1 \u2013 Inequitable distribution of manpower and resources\nA fixed percentage of seats in each private colleges with government-determined fee structure will cater to economically underprivileged meritorious students. This can meet the issue of access to medical education by weaker sections.\nRemoving bottlenecks to starting colleges, such as conditions stipulating the possession of a vast extent of land and needlessly extensive infrastructure, will considerably rectify the imbalance, especially in under-served States. The primary criterion to set up a college should only be the availability of suitable facilities to impart quality medical education.\n#Issue 2 \u2013 Low doctor-population ratio\nEnding the fee cap and allowing private medical colleges to start new for-profit colleges.\nThis will meet the supply side constraints of medical practice in India by increasing number of doctors. It will also eliminate the regulatory-capture of the medical field in India.\nthis will also reduce corruption and black money generation simultaneously increasing the government revenue. Also, competition among private colleges will decrease the fees, making medical education accessible to all sections of society.\nBridge courses which allow alternative-medicine practitioners (AYUSH) to prescribe modern drugs. (in line with barefoot doctors in China) can broad-base pyramid of health sector by increasing doctors in primary and secondary sector.\nEmpowering experienced doctors and nurses for taking additional responsibilities will be a method for optimal utilization of experienced manpower to give health care services.\nthree-year diploma course for rural medical-care providers, in lines of the Licentiate Medical Practitioners(before 1946), to take up the additional responsibilities of the healthcare sector\nLeverage practitioners in AYUSH to meet doctor deficit through\u00a0cross-practising.\u00a0Shailaja Chandra report 2013\u00a0had opined that\u00a0National Rural Health Mission had recruited AYUSH physicians as the sole care provider in many states, which were effective in meeting the requirement of health care providers. The report recommended training those AYUSH physicians to meet demands in Primary Health Centres.\n#Issue 3 \u2013 Deficiencies in the quality of medical education\nNational licentiate examination for doctors to practice medicine can help to restore public confidence in the competence of medical practitioners by ensuring uniform quality standards across India. Entrance level non-uniformity is met with the introduction of NEET\nIndian healthcare system should incorporate the\u00a0Psycho Socio-Ecological (PSE) model of health.\u00a0PSE focuses on\u00a0social determinants of health with an emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention\nMedical education pedagogy should be improved by frequently revamping syllabus with respect to new breakthroughs in the medical field. The curriculum should include training on emerging technologies and models of healthcare delivery.\nIndia doesn\u2019t follow the use of OSCEs (objective structured clinical exams) to test medical candidates. Thus, their clinical skills are not tested till they start practising.\n#Issue 4 \u2013 Lack of social accountability\nNeed to align medical education with societal needs and expectations than work in isolation. For this community-based education is needed.\n#Issue 5 \u2013 Revamping MCI\nSeparation of power between medical education and medical practice should be the first step in reforming the MCI.\nThere should be an independent selection committee to select members in NMC than electing the members as is done previously with MCI.\nthe annual inspection should be scrapped with one-time registration and licensing, thus nullifying the scope of corruption through random inspections.\nThere should be an independent accreditation and rating agency to inspect and rate colleges on basic standards and a penalty for not conferring with set standards.\nTo reflect interests and concerns of states, an advisory body consisting of representatives from all states and UT should be constituted to advise NMC. Because each state have varied requirements and for a federal nation like India, a one-size-fits-all policy is not suitable. This will lead to issues, like that of Tamil Nadu during the implementation of NEET, to crop up.\nConclusion\n\nIndian higher education system has a common problem concerning with incapacity of regulators like UGC, AICTE, MCI etc. A common problem of these institutions is the concentration of power as they regulate both educational practices and professional practices\u00a0leading to a conflict of interest. There is a need for comprehensive reforms to usher in governance reforms for cleansing Indian higher education system of its maladies.\n\nMoreover, all stakeholders should acknowledge that medical education has a special sanctity in itself. This should not be lost to the altar of profit-making.\n\nAs from above discussion, it is clear that a complete surgery of Indian medical education system is needed in order to cure cancer with which it has been afflicted. NMC act will be a watershed act in this respect. For a bill of such huge scope, it is prudent to have wide-ranging debates and discussions. So delay in the passage of the act is worth the while for waiting.\n\nArticle by: Sethu\u00a0Krishnan M\n\nReferences: PRS blog, The Hindu, Wikipedia, Hindustan Times, New Indian Express, India Today",

States/UTs will set up an independent State School Standards Authority (SSSA). Transparent public self-disclosure of all the basic regulatory information, as laid down by the SSSA, will be used extensively for public oversight and accountability. The SCERT will develop a School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Framework (SQAAF) through consultations with all stakeholders.\n\nNational Education Policy: Higher Education\n\nThe New Education Policy has a great vision for the Higher Education sector as well.\n\nIncrease GER to 50 % by 2035\n\nNEP 2020 aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio in higher education including vocational education from 26.3% (2018) to 50% by 2035. 3.5 Crore new seats will be added to Higher education institutions.\n\nHolistic Multidisciplinary Education\n\nThe policy envisages broad-based, multi-disciplinary, holistic Undergraduate education with flexible curricula, creative combinations of subjects, integration of vocational education, and multiple entries and exit points with appropriate certification.

Public and private higher education institutions will be governed by the same set of norms for regulation, accreditation, and academic standards.\n\nRationalized Institutional Architecture\n\nHigher education institutions will be transformed into large, well-resourced, vibrant multidisciplinary institutions providing high-quality teaching, research, and community engagement. The definition of the university will allow a spectrum of institutions that range from research-intensive Universities to Teaching-intensive Universities and Autonomous degree-granting Colleges.\n\nAffiliation of colleges is to be phased out in 15 years and a stage-wise mechanism is to be established for granting graded autonomy to colleges. Over a period of time, it is envisaged that every college would develop into either an Autonomous degree-granting College or a constituent college of a university.\n\nMotivated, Energized, and Capable Faculty\n\nNEP makes recommendations for motivating, energizing, and building the capacity of faculty through clearly defined, independent, transparent recruitment, freedom to design curricula/pedagogy, incentivizing excellence, and movement into institutional leadership. Faculty not delivering on basic norms will be held accountable\n\nTeacher Education\n\nA new and comprehensive National Curriculum Framework for Teacher Education, NCFTE 2021, will be formulated by the NCTE in consultation with NCERT.

Stand-alone technical universities, health science universities, legal and agricultural universities, etc. will aim to become multi-disciplinary institutions.\n\nAdult Education\n\nThe policy aims to achieve 100% youth and adult literacy.\n\nFinancing Education\n\nThe Centre and the States will work together to increase public investment in the Education sector to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest.\n\nAlso read: PM-USHA\n\nNEP: Consultation Process\n\nNEP 2020 has been formulated after an unprecedented process of consultation that involved nearly over 2 lakh suggestions from 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats, 6600 Blocks, 6000 ULBs, and 676 Districts.\n\nThe MHRD initiated an unprecedented collaborative, inclusive, and highly participatory consultation process in January 2015. In May 2016, \u2018The Committee for Evolution of the New Education Policy\u2019 under the Chairmanship of Late Shri T.S.R. Subramanian, Former Cabinet Secretary, submitted its report.\n\nBased on this, the Ministry prepared \u2018Some Inputs for the Draft National Education Policy, 2016\u2019. In June 2017 a \u2018Committee for the Draft National Education Policy\u2019 was constituted under the Chairmanship of eminent Scientist Padma Vibhushan, Dr. K. Kasturirangan, which submitted the Draft National Education Policy, 2019 to the Hon\u2019ble Human Resource Development Minister on 31st May 2019.\n\nThe Draft National Education Policy 2019 was uploaded on MHRD\u2019s website and at the \u2018MyGov Innovate\u2019 portal eliciting views/suggestions/comments from stakeholders, including the public.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the National Education Policy (NEP) is a crucial document that outlines the roadmap for the development of education in India. It is a significant step towards building a knowledge-based society that is equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The NEP aims to transform the education system by providing equitable access to quality education, promoting innovation, and fostering holistic development.\n\nThe policy emphasizes the need for a learner-centered approach that focuses on critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving. It also seeks to promote interdisciplinary learning, multilingualism, and the integration of vocational education into the mainstream curriculum.\n\nThe NEP\u2019s vision of a flexible and inclusive education system that enables lifelong learning is laudable. However, the success of the policy will depend on its effective implementation, which will require adequate funding, infrastructure, and skilled educators.\n\nOverall, the NEP has the potential to revolutionize the education sector in India and make it more relevant and responsive to the needs of the changing world. It is a bold and visionary document that seeks to transform education from being a means of social mobility to a tool for building a better and more just society.\n\nAlso Read: Institutions of Eminence Scheme;\u00a0Education in state list: Should it be restored?",

These reform movements evoked the spirit of devoting life to doing something for the disadvantaged sections of society. It recognized the right of untouchables to education, work of choice and worship, the right of women to education and other social aspects of life. This gave birth to the idea of voluntary organizations for the first time in Indian history.\n\nPhase two: The second half of the 19th century witnessed an unprecedented socio-political awakening that resulted in the blooming of institutionalized reform movements such as Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission etc. This prompted the Government to enact the Societies Registration Act of 1860.\n\nPhase three\u00a0(1900-1947): This period marked the successful attempt to channel the voluntary spirit for political action and mass mobilization for the struggle for independence. It influenced the formation of many future voluntary organizations.\n\nPost-Independence period:\u00a0 In the post-independence period, a large number of voluntary organizations have taken part in the process of nation-building. The shift to a neoliberal economic and political agenda facilitated the growth of voluntary organizations at a faster pace.\n\nRegistration of NGOs\n\nIndian NGOs mainly come under three segments \u2013 Societies, Trusts, and Charitable Companies.\n\nSocieties: Societies have to register under The Societies Registration Act, of 1860.\nTrusts: Private trusts are registered under the central government\u2019s Indian Trusts Act, of 1882, and public ones are registered under the state legislation concerned.\nCharitable companies: They are set up according to section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. For charitable companies, the compliance requirements are high, as loans and advances are easily available to them compared to a trust or a society. They have to even pay Income tax under the IT Act 1961.\nWho regulates NGOs?\n\nThere are laws for the regulation of the functioning of NGOs in India. Foreign Contribution Regulation Act(FCRA) and Foreign Exchange Management Act(FEMA Act)\u00a0are among the most important laws connected with NGOs.\n\nForeign Contribution Regulation Act(FCRA)\n\nHistory: Enacted in 1976 by the IndiraGandhi-led Government during the emergency. It regulates all grants, non-Indian gifts, and donations-Indian residents. It also prohibits electoral candidates, political parties, judges, MPs and even cartoonists from accepting foreign contributions. The ostensible justification given for the law was to curb foreign interference in domestic politics.\n\nFCRA (Amendment Act) 2010 highlights:\n\nThe amended FCRA Act 2010, barred organizations of a \u2018political nature\u2019 from accepting foreign contributions. It also mandated that the organizations receiving foreign funds should renew their licenses every five years.\n\nFCRA and Political parties\nIn 2014, the Delhi High Court found that both BJP and Congress were violating the provisions of FCRA (See the FCRA,2010 Amendment) by accepting funds from the Indian Subsidiaries of London-based multinational Vedanta.\nIn 2016, the Government made an amendment to FCRA 2010 with retrospective effect, so that contributions from foreign companies (with 50% foreign shareholding) to not-for-profit, political parties and candidates contesting elections, newspapers, government employees etc. does not come under the definition of foreign source.\nImpact of Amendment\nIt made it legal for political parties to accept foreign aid through Indian subsidiaries.\nThis move helped Companies to ease CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) spending as repetitive consent from the Home Ministry is no longer required for the disbursement of funds by foreign companies.\nNGOs have got access to foreign funds more easily than before except for the prior permission category NGOs.\nFCRA and NGOs:\nAccording to the FCRA, any NGO that accepts foreign contributions has to register with the Home Ministry and such contributions can only be accepted through designated banks.\nThe NGO has to report to the central government any foreign contribution within 30 days of its receipt.\nThey need to file annual reports with the home ministry. It must also report the amount of foreign contribution, its source, how it was received, the purpose for which it was intended, and the manner in which it was utilized.\nIn a case of non-compliance with provisions of the FCRA, the government can penalize an NGO. For example, if these NGOs don\u2019t file annual returns, the government can issue a show-cause notice and subsequently, suspend or cancel their foreign funding licenses.\nIn the last two years, licenses of around 20000 NGOs have been cancelled by the central government after they were found violating various provisions of the FCRA act. Hence those NGOs were barred from receiving any foreign funds.\nForeign Exchange Management Act (FEMA)\nThere are certain NGOs which are registered under FEMA and they disburse foreign funds to various associations within the country. Nearly 100 international NGOs and associations receive foreign funds through their liaison offices and disburse them to NGOs across India.\nAccording to the FEMA Act, these NGOs are regulated by the Finance Ministry. For example, International donors such as the Ford Foundation, the U.K.\u2019s Department for International Development etc are registered under FEMA but not the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) 2010. This makes it difficult to monitor the flow of funds effectively.\nThe role of NGOs in our society\nThey act as service contractors, able to work more efficiently and more effectively than government agencies thereby playing an important role in the socio-economic transformation.\nIt brings accountability and transparency to governance.\nIt acts as a human rights watchdog in the society.\nNGOs act as channels for donors to provide international development funds to low-income countries or developing countries.\nIssues with the functioning of NGOs:\n\nMisappropriation of funds: Many NGOs don\u2019t have sophisticated finance and legal teams, nor do they have the funds to conduct audits.\nThe external issue of funding: According to government data a total of 3,068 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) received foreign funding above Rs. 22,000 Cr in 2014-15. It is often said that foreign-funded NGOs try to propagate foreign propaganda to stall developmental projects. Example: Kudankulam Protest.\nNonaccountable, nontransparent undemocratic functioning: CBI records filed in the Supreme Court show that only 10% of the total registered NGOs under the Societies Registration Act file annual financial statements.\nMoney Laundering: Corrupt or unscrupulous NGOs that receive foreign funds may serve as conduits for money laundering.\nWay ahead\nA regulatory mechanism to keep a watch on the financial activities of NGOs and voluntary organizations is the need of the hour.\nThe government should frame guidelines for their accreditation, the manner in which these organizations should maintain their accounts and the procedure for recovery in case they fail to submit their balance sheets.\nAvoid tussle between the Home Ministry and Finance Ministry by bringing the regulation of NGOs under one head.\nGeneral Financial Rules, 2005 have mandated a regulatory mechanism for the NGOs and a comprehensive law in line with these rules should be framed in no time.\n\nRead:\u00a0Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs)\n\nReferences:\n\nThe Hindu\u00a0and The Hindu.\nWikipedia.\nWHO.\nPRSindia.\nEconomic Times.\nFirst Post.\nFinMin.\nFCRAonline.\nGlobal Policy.\n\nArticle contributed by: Sree Resmi S",

It is typically introduced in a year when general elections are scheduled, and a new government is expected to take power.\n\nThe main purpose of the interim budget is to allow the government to continue its operations and meet its financial obligations until the new government is formed and presents the full budget.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe interim budget covers the government\u2019s expenditures and receipts for a part of the fiscal year.\n\nKey Characteristics of an Interim Budget:\n\nDuration: Unlike the full annual budget, which outlines financial plans for the entire fiscal year, the interim budget usually covers a shorter period\u2014often a few months until the new government is in place.\nExpenditure Approval: It seeks the Parliament\u2019s approval for incurring expenses and withdrawing funds from the Consolidated Fund of India for the ongoing operations of the government until the full budget is passed.\nLimited Announcements: The interim budget generally avoids making any major policy announcements or introducing new schemes. It is more about maintaining continuity in government spending and operations.\nVote on Account: The primary component of an interim budget is the \u201cvote on account,\u201d which seeks approval for essential government spending, including salaries, administrative expenses, and ongoing project expenditures, without a detailed discussion on each demand.\nRevenue and Expenditure Estimates: It provides an overview of the government\u2019s revenue and expenditure for the part of the fiscal year. However, it might not include detailed economic projections or tax proposals, which are typically reserved for the full budget.\nPolitical Considerations: Given its timing before elections, the interim budget is often scrutinized for any measures that could influence voters, though traditionally it is expected to be a neutral financial statement.\n\nImportance:\n\nContinuity of Government Operations: It ensures that the government has the legal authority to spend funds and keep its operations running smoothly, avoiding any disruptions in public services.\nTransition to New Government: It allows the incoming government to have a say in the financial plans for the majority of the fiscal year, enabling them to implement their policies and priorities through a full budget.\nEconomic Stability: By ensuring that government expenditures and operations continue unhindered, the interim budget plays a role in maintaining economic stability.\nInterim Budget 2024: Key highlights\n\nThe Finance Minister confirmed the continuation of existing tax rates, covering direct, and indirect taxes, and export duties.

    "[CONTENT] #669": "The Union Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey 2021-22 in Parliament on January 31, 2022. Read to know about the Economic Survey 2021-22 highlights.\n\nEconomic Survey is the flagship annual document of the Ministry of finance \u2013 released usually a day before the Budget for the next year is presented in the Indian Parliament.\n\nEconomic Survey gives a detailed account of the various sectors of the economy and overall economic scenario of the country in the past years and provides an outline for the year ahead.\n\nThe Economic Survey, even though a government document, provides an opportunity for the Chief Economic Adviser to provide a disinterested, economic objective analysis.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the theme of Economic Survey 2021-22?\nWhat is the Agile approach mentioned in the Economic Survey 2021?\nEconomic Survey 2021-22: Highlights\nState of the Economy\nFiscal Developments\nExternal Sectors\nMonetary Management and Financial Intermediation\nPrices and Inflation\nSustainable Development and Climate Change\nAgriculture and Food Management\nIndustry and Infrastructure\nServices\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 Summary\nWhat is the theme of Economic Survey 2021-22?\n\nThe central theme of this year\u2019s Economic Survey is the \u201cAgile approach\u201d, implemented through India\u2019s economic response to the COVID-19 Pandemic shock.\n\nAnother theme highlighted in this Economic Survey relates to the art and science of policy-making under conditions of extreme uncertainty.\n\nWhat is the Agile approach mentioned in the Economic Survey 2021?\n\nAs per the Agile approach, short-term policy responses can be tailored to an evolving situation rather than what a model may have predicted.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe short-term policy response is possible because of the explosion of real-time data that allows for constant monitoring. Such information includes GST collections, digital payments, satellite photographs, electricity production, cargo movements, internal/external trade, infrastructure roll-out, delivery of various schemes, mobility indicators etc.\n\nThe \u201cAgile approach\u201d is based on feedback loops, real-time monitoring of actual outcomes, flexible responses, safety-net buffers and so on.\n\nPlanning is not done in the Agile approach as a deterministic prediction of the flow of events. Still, planning is relevant in the framework \u2013 mostly for scenario analysis, identifying vulnerable sections, and understanding policy options.\n\nEconomic Survey 2021-22: Highlights\n\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 reverts to a single volume plus a separate volume for the Statistical Appendix.\n\nThe highlights of the Economic Survey are as follows:\n\nState of the Economy\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 estimates that the Indian economy (GDP) may grow by 9.2 per cent in real terms in 2021-22 (as per first advanced estimates) subsequent to a contraction of 7.3 per cent in 2020-21.\nGDP is projected to grow by 8- 8.5 per cent in real terms in 2022-23.\nThe year ahead is poised for a pickup in private sector investment with the financial system in a good position to provide support for the economy\u2019s revival.\nProjection is comparable with World Bank and Asian Development Bank\u2019s latest forecasts of real GDP growth of 8.7 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively for 2022-23.\nAs per IMF\u2019s latest World Economic Outlook projections, India\u2019s real GDP is projected to grow at 9 per cent in 2021-22 and 2022-23 and at 7.1 per cent in 2023-2024, which would make India the fastest-growing major economy in the world for all 3years.\nAgriculture and allied sectors are expected to grow by 3.9 per cent; industry by 11.8 per cent and services sector by 8.2 per cent in 2021-22.\nOn the demand side, consumption is estimated to grow by 7.0 per cent, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) by 15 per cent, exports by 16.5 per cent and imports by 29.4 per cent in 2021-22.\nMacroeconomic stability indicators suggest that the Indian Economy is well placed to take on the challenges of 2022-23.\nA combination of high foreign exchange reserves, sustained foreign direct investment, and rising export earnings will provide an adequate buffer against possible global liquidity tapering in 2022-23.\nThe economic impact of the \u201csecond wave\u201d was much smaller than that during the full lockdown phase in 2020-21, though the health impact was more severe.\nGovernment of India\u2019s unique response comprised of safety-nets to cushion the impact on vulnerable sections of society and the business sector, significant increase in capital expenditure to spur growth and supply-side reforms for a sustained long-term expansion.\nThe government\u2019s flexible and multi-layered response is partly based on an \u201cAgile\u201d framework that uses feedback-loops, and the use of eighty High-Frequency Indicators (HFIs) in an environment of extreme uncertainty.\nFiscal Developments\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 observes that the revenue receipts from the Central Government (April to November 2021) have gone up by 67.2 per cent (YoY) as against the expected growth of 9.6 per cent in the 2021-22 Budget Estimates (over 2020-21 Provisional Actuals).\nGross Tax Revenue registers a growth of over 50 per cent from April to November 2021 in YoY terms.\u00a0 This performance is strong compared to pre-pandemic levels of 2019-2020 also.\nDuring April-November 2021, Capex has grown by 13.5 per cent (YoY) with a focus on infrastructure-intensive sectors.\nSustained revenue collection and a targeted expenditure policy have contained the fiscal deficit for April to November 2021 at 46.2 per cent of BE.\nWith the enhanced borrowings on account of COVID-19, the Central Government debt has gone up from 49.1 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 59.3 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 but is expected to follow a declining trajectory with the recovery of the economy.\nExternal Sectors\nIndia\u2019s merchandise exports and imports rebounded strongly and surpassed pre-COVID levels during the current financial year.\nThere was a significant pickup in net services with both receipts and payments crossing the pre-pandemic levels, despite weak tourism revenues.\nNet capital flows were higher at US$ 65.6 billion in the first half of 2021-22, on account of continued inflow of foreign investment, revival in net external commercial borrowings, higher banking capital and additional special drawing rights (SDR) allocation.\nIndia\u2019s external debt rose to US $ 593.1 billion at the end-September 2021, from US $ 556.8 billion a year earlier, reflecting additional SDR allocation by IMF, coupled with higher commercial borrowings.\nForeign Exchange Reserves crossed US$ 600 billion in the first half of 2021-22 and touched US $ 633.6 billion as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of end-November 2021, India was the fourth-largest forex reserves holder in the world after China, Japan and Switzerland.\nMonetary Management and Financial Intermediation\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 notes that the liquidity in the system remained in surplus.\nRepo rate was maintained at 4 per cent in 2021-22.\nRBI undertook various measures such as G-Sec Acquisition Programme and Special Long-Term Repo Operations to provide further liquidity.\nThe economic shock of the pandemic has been weathered well by the commercial banking system:\nYoY Bank credit growth accelerated gradually in 2021-22 from 5.3 per cent in April 2021 to 9.2 per cent as of 31st\u00a0December 2021.\nThe Gross Non-Performing Advances ratio of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) declined from 11.2 per cent at the end of 2017-18 to 6.9 per cent at the end of September 2021.\nNet Non-Performing Advances ratio declined from 6 per cent to 2.2 per cent during the same period.\nThe capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of SCBs continued to increase from 13 per cent in 2013-14 to 16.54 per cent at the end of September 2021.\nThe Return on Assets and Return on Equity for Public Sector Banks continued to be positive for the period ending September 2021.\nExceptional year for the capital markets:\nRs. 89,066 crores were raised via 75 Initial Public Offering (IPO) issues in April-November 2021, which is much higher than in any year in the last decade.\nSensex and Nifty scaled up to a touching peak at 61,766 and 18,477 on October 18, 2021.\nAmong major emerging market economies, Indian markets outperformed peers in April-December 2021.\nPrices and Inflation\nThe average headline CPI-Combined inflation moderated to 5.2 per cent in 2021-22 (April-December) from 6.6 per cent in the corresponding period of 2020-21.\nThe decline in retail inflation was led by the easing of food inflation.\nFood inflation averaged at a low of 2.9 per cent in 2021-22 (April to December) as against 9.1 per cent in the corresponding period last year.\nEffective supply-side management kept prices of most essential commodities under control during the year.\nProactive measures were taken to contain the price rise in pulses and edible oils.\nReduction in central excise and subsequent cuts in Value Added Tax by most States helped ease petrol and diesel prices.\nWholesale inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) rose to 12.5 per cent during 2021-22 (April to December).\n\u00a0This has been attributed to:\nLow base in the previous year,\nPick-up in economic activity,\nA sharp increase in international prices of crude oil and other imported inputs, and\nHigh freight costs.\nThe divergence between CPI-C and WPI Inflation:\nThe divergence peaked at 9.6 percentage points in May 2020.\nHowever, this year there was a reversal in divergence with retail inflation falling below wholesale inflation by 8.0 percentage points in December 2021.\nThis divergence can be explained by factors such as:\nVariations due to base effect,\nThe difference in scope and coverage of the two indices,\nPrice collections,\nItems covered,\nThe difference in commodity weights, and\nWPI is more sensitive to cost-push inflation led by imported inputs.\nWith the gradual waning of the base effect in WPI, the divergence in CPI-C and WPI is also expected to narrow down.\nSustainable Development and Climate Change\n\nIndia\u2019s overall score on the NITI Aayog SDG India Index and Dashboard improved to 66 in 2020-21 from 60 in 2019-20 and 57 in 2018-19.\n\nThe number of Front Runners (scoring 65-99) increased to 22 States and UTs in 2020-21 from 10 in 2019-20.\n\nIn North-East India, 64 districts were Front Runners and 39 districts were Performers in the NITI Aayog North-Eastern Region District SDG Index 2021-22.\n\nIndia has the tenth largest forest area in the world.\n\nIn 2020, India ranked third globally in increasing its forest area from 2010 to 2020.\n\nIn 2020, the forests covered 24% of India\u2019s total geographical, accounting for 2% of the world\u2019s total forest area.\n\nIn August 2021, the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, was notified which is aimed at phasing out single-use plastic by 2022.\n\nDraft regulation on Extended Producer Responsibility for plastic packaging was notified.\n\nThe Compliance status of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) located in the Ganga main stem and its tributaries improved from 39% in 2017 to 81% in 2020.\n\nThe consequent reduction in effluent discharge has been from 349.13 million litres per day (MLD) in 2017 to 280.20 MLD in 2020.\n\nThe Prime Minister, as a part of the national statement delivered at the 26th\u00a0Conference of Parties (COP 26) in Glasgow in November 2021, announced ambitious targets to be achieved by 2030 to enable further reduction in emissions.\n\nThe need to start the one-word movement \u2018LIFE\u2019 (Lifestyle for Environment) urging mindful and deliberate utilization instead of mindless and destructive consumption was underlined.\n\nAgriculture and Food Management\n\nThe Agriculture sector experienced buoyant growth in the past two years, accounting for a sizeable 18.8% (2021-22) in Gross Value Added (GVA) of the country registering a growth of 3.6% in 2020-21 and 3.9% in 2021-22.\n\nMinimum Support Price (MSP) policy is being used to promote crop diversification.\n\nNet receipts from crop production have increased by 22.6% in the latest

It is also a source of policy ideas. Here are 10 key points from the survey which you should not miss.\n\n1. The question asked by Economic Survey 2020: \u201cWhat causes wealth and prosperity of nations?\u201d\n\nThe Economic Survey 2019-20 attempts to craft a framework of policies that can foster wealth creation in India.\n\nThis inquiry is particularly critical at this stage as India aspires to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025. The survey starts by quoting Adam Smith, who wrote \u201cAn Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\u201d in 1776.\n\n2. The theme of Economic Survey 2020: Enable markets, promote \u2018pro-business\u2019 policies and strengthen \u2018trust\u2019 in the economy\n\nThe theme of Economic Survey 2020 is \u201cEnable markets, promote \u2018pro-business\u2019 policies and strengthen \u2018trust\u2019 in the economy\u201d.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nInterestingly, former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh has spoken in this direction. He pointed out a few months back that the loss of trust is the main reason for the current economic slowdown in India. It\u2019s a good sign that the ES2020 is paving the way for policies addressing this concern.\n\nNote: The theme of last year\u2019s Economic Survey (ES 2018-2019) was to enable shifting gears to accelerate and sustain a real GDP growth rate of 8% and thereby achieve the vision of a $5 trillion Indian economy.\n\n3. Only when wealth is created wealth will be distributed\n\nEconomic Survey2020 quotes the Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister\u2019s Independence Day Speech on 15th August 2019, when he highlighted that only when\nwealth is created will wealth be distributed?\n\n4. Suspicion towards India\u2019s wealth-creators is ill-advised\n\nES2020 says that the feeling of suspicion and disrespect towards India\u2019s wealth-creators is ill-advised.\n\nEcoSurvey 2019-20 attempts to put to rest any skepticism about the benefits accruing from a market economy, both in economic thinking and policy-making.\n\n5. Ethical wealth creation is a noble human pursuit\n\nEconomic Survey 2019-2020 is bold and open in stating that ethical wealth creation is a noble human pursuit.\n\n6. The ideas of wealth creation are rooted in India\u2019s old tradition\n\nThe Survey documents that ideas of wealth creation are rooted in India\u2019s old and rich traditions ranging from Kautilya\u2019s Arthashastra to Thiruvalluvar\u2019s Thirukural. ES survey finds that India has been the dominant economic power globally for more than three-fourths of known economic history. The survey points out that India has designed it to be wealthy.\n\n7. The invisible hand of the market supported by the hand of trust\n\nEconomic Survey \u2013 throughout most chapters \u2013 hints about the power of the invisible hand of the market. It argues for eliminating policies that undermine markets through government intervention.\n\nThe survey also speaks volumes about the need to build trust by ending static-crony capitalism. It mentions the need to shift from \u201cPro-crony\u201d to \u201cpro-business\u201d, particularly promoting entrepreneurship at the grass-root level.\n\n8. Trust is a public good\n\nEconomic Survey Introduces the idea of \u201ctrust as a public good that gets enhanced with greater use\u201d. The Survey also makes some suggestions for enhancing this public good.\n\n9. Indian GDP estimates can be trusted\n\nWhile many are now skeptical about the authenticity and accuracy of the GDP figures released by the Government of India, the Survey says that GDP estimates can be trusted.\n\n10. Use of principles of behavioral economics as instruments of economic policy\n\nThis year\u2019s ES like last year\u2019s ES, uses principles of behavioral economics as instruments of economic policy. This is used as an easy prism to gain insights about human behavior.\n\nIn this context, the Economic Survey 2019-20 presents \u201cThalinomics\u201d- an attempt to relate economics to the common person using something that he or she encounters every day \u2013 a plate of food i.e. a Thali.\n\nImportant Economic Statistics from Economic Survey 2019-20\n\nEconomic Survey 2019-20 has put current fiscal growth (2019-20) at five per cent.\nES2020 mentions that the fiscal deficit target for the current fiscal may need to be relaxed to revive growth.\nEconomic Survey 2019-20 has projected economic growth at 6 to 6.5 per cent in the fiscal year (2020-21) starting 1st of April this year.\nAbout 1.24 lakh new firms were created in 2018, which is an increase of about 80 percent from about 70,000 in 2014.\nThe industrial sector, as per the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), registered only a growth of 0.6 percent in 2019-20 (April-November) as compared to 5.0 percent during 2018-19 (April-November).\nIndia\u2019s BoP position improved from US$ 412.9 bn of forex reserves in end-March, 2019 to US$ 433.7 bn in end-September 2019. Foreign reserves stood at US$ 461.2 bn as of 10th January 2020.\nThe Gross Non-Performing Advances ratio remained unchanged for Scheduled Commercial banks at 9.3% between March and September 2019. NPA increased slightly for the Non-Banking Financial Corporations (NBFCs) from 6.1% in March 2019 to 6.3% in September 2019.\nCurrent Account Deficit (CAD) narrowed to 1.5 % of GDP in H1 of 2019-20 from 2.1 % in 2018-19.\nFrom 2006-07 to 2019-20, the affordability of vegetarian Thalis improved by 29 % while the affordability of non-vegetarian Thalis improved by 18 %.\n\nDOWNLOAD 100 IMPORTANT MCQS FROM ES AND BUDGET 2020\n\nWhat makes the Economic Survey 2020 special?\n\nKrishnamurthy V. Subramanian, the Chief Economic Adviser of the Ministry of Finance has done a commendable job in producing a thought-provoking masterpiece on \u2018ethical wealth creation\u2018, particularly at this crucial time when India is facing a major economic slowdown.\n\nEconomic Survey 2019-20 believes that India has an unprecedented opportunity to chart a China-like labor-intensive, export trajectory. The survey emphasizes creating jobs and growth by specialization in network products.\n\nThe survey moves forward ideas like integrating \u201cAssemble in India\u201d into \u201cMake In India\u201d to focus on labor-intensive exports and thereby create jobs on a large scale. It also discusses efficiently scaling up the banking sector to be proportionate to the size of the Indian economy. Meanwhile, it also advises tracking the health of the shadow banking sector.\n\nThe survey had called for more reforms to make it easier to do business in the country. It advises the use of privatization to foster efficiency.\n\nThe survey said for India to achieve a five trillion US dollar economy depends on promoting pro-business policies, strengthening the invisible hand of the market, and ease of doing business.\n\nThe Economic Survey 2019-20 has given the emphasis on entrepreneurship and wealth creation at the grassroots. This message is reflected in Budget 2020 as well.",

India has only 7 taxpayers for every 100 voters!\n\nIndia has only 7 taxpayers for every 100 voters ranking us 13th amongst 18 of our democratic G-20 peers. This raises one important question: India has political democracy, but does it has fiscal democracy?\n\n2. India\u2019s Demographic Dividend will last longer (for around 45 years)\n\nIndia has a distinctive demographic dividend. India\u2019s share of working age to non-working age population will peak later and at a lower level than that for other countries but last longer. The peak of the growth boost due to the demographic dividend is fast approaching, with peninsular states peaking soon and the hinterland states peaking much later.\n\n3. As a percent of GDP, India Trades More Than China!\n\nAs of 2011, India\u2019s openness \u2013 measured as the ratio of trade in goods and services to GDP has far overtaken China\u2019s, a country famed for using trade as an engine of growth. India\u2019s internal trade to GDP is also comparable to that of other large countries and very different from the caricature of a barrier-riddled economy.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt should also be noted that India\u2019s internal trade as a percentage of GDP is also reasonably high. India\u2019s internal trade to GDP is also comparable to that of other large countries and very different from the caricature of a barrier-riddled economy.\n\n4. Divergence within India, Big Time\n\nSpatial dispersion in income is still rising in India in the last decade (2004-14), unlike the rest of the world and even China. That is, despite more porous borders within India than between countries internationally, the forces of \u201cconvergence\u201d have been elusive.\n\n5. There is Big Unexploited Property Tax Potential in India\n\n\nEvidence from satellite data indicates that Bengaluru and Jaipur collect only between 5% to 20% of their potential property taxes.\n\n6.\u00a0Work-Related Migration has increased since 2011\n\nAs can be seen from the above graph, 8-10 million people migrate on annual basis for work. This is\u00a0based on railway passenger traffic data. This figure is almost double of what the 2011 Census suggests.\n\n7. There are biases in perception with respect to China and India\n\nChina\u2019s credit rating was upgraded from A+ to AA- in December 2010 while India\u2019s has remained unchanged at BBB-. From 2009 to 2015, China\u2019s credit-to-GDP soared from about 142 percent to 205 percent and its growth decelerated. The contrast with India\u2019s indicators is striking.\n\n8. There is a big shortfall in the allocation of funds to many poor districts!\n\nWelfare spending in India suffers from misallocation: as the pair of charts show, the districts with the poorest (in red on the left) are the ones that suffer from the greatest shortfall of funds (in red on the right) in social programs. The districts accounting for the poorest 40% receive only 29% of the total funding. There is a big shortfall in allocation to many poor districts.\n\nCourtesy: Economic Survey",

    "[CONTENT] #678": "Just like the Economic Survey 2016 which had 8 interesting facts, Economic Survey 2017 too has brought us new facts. The Economic Survey 2017-18 has relied upon analysis of the new data to highlight ten new economic facts, which is discussed below.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFact 1: Large increase in registered indirect as well as direct taxpayers.\nFact 2: Indian formal sector is substantially greater than what it is currently is believed to be\nFact 3: States prosperity is positively correlated with international trade and inter-state trade\nFact 4: India\u2019s export structure is more egalitarian than many large countries\nFact 5: Clothing incentive package boosted exports of ready-made garments\nFact 6: Indian parents continue to have children until they get the desired number of sons\nFact 7: Government action could decrease substantial litigation in the tax arena\nFact 8: Growth in Saving\u00a0\u2260 Economic Growth; Growth in Investment = Economic Growth\nFact 9: Collection of direct taxes by Indian states and Local Self Governments are significantly lower than their counterparts\nFact 10: Extreme weather adversely impacts agricultural yields\nView the 10 New Facts on Indian Economy as a Graphical Presentation\nFact 1: Large increase in registered indirect as well as direct taxpayers.\n\nGoods and Services Tax (GST) has given a new perceptive of the Indian economy and new data has emerged. There has been a fifty percent increase in the number of indirect taxpayers. There has also been a large increase in voluntary registrations, especially by small enterprises that buy from large enterprises wanting to avail themselves of input tax credits.\n\nThe Survey also stated that fears of major producing states that the shift to the new system would undermine their tax collections have been allayed as the distribution of the GST base among the states got closely linked to the size of their economies.\n\nSimilarly, there has been an addition of about 18 lakh in individual income tax filers since November 2016.\n\nFact 2: Indian formal sector is substantially greater than what it is currently is believed to be\n\nIndia\u2019s formal sector, especially formal non-farm payroll, is substantially greater than what it currently is believed to be. It became evident that when \u201cformality\u201d was defined in terms of social security provisions like EPFO/ESIC the formal sector payroll was found to be about 31 percent of the non-agricultural workforce. When \u201cformality\u201d was defined in terms of being part of the GST net, such formal sector payroll share was found to be 53 percent.\n\nFact 3: States prosperity is positively correlated with international trade and inter-state trade\n\nData on the international exports of states indicates a strong correlation between export performance and states\u2019 standard of living. States that export internationally and trade with other states were found to be richer. Such correlation is stronger between prosperity and international trade.\n\nFact 4: India\u2019s export structure is more egalitarian than many large countries\n\nIndia\u2019s exports are unusual in that the largest firms account for a much smaller share of exports than in other comparable countries. Top one percent of Indian firms account only for 38% of exports unlike in other countries where they account for substantially greater share \u2013 (72, 68, 67 and 55 percent in Brazil, Germany, Mexico and USA respectively). Such tendencies were also found to be true for the top five or ten percent of the Indian companies.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFact 5: Clothing incentive package boosted exports of ready-made garments\n\nIt was pointed out that the Rebate of State Levies (ROSL) has increased exports of ready-made garments (man-made fibres) by about 16 percent but not of others.\n\nFact 6: Indian parents continue to have children until they get the desired number of sons\n\nThe data highlighted another seemingly known fact that Indian society exhibits a strong desire for a male child. It pointed out that most parents continued to have children until they get a number of sons. The survey gave details of various scenarios leading to skewed sex ratios and also gave a comparison of sex ratio by birth between India and Indonesia.\n\nFact 7: Government action could decrease substantial litigation in the tax arena\n\nThe survey pointed out that tax departments in India have gone in for contesting against in several tax disputes but also with a low success rate which is below 30 percent. About 66 percent of pending cases accounted for only 1.8 percent of value at stake. It further stated that 0.2 percent of cases accounted for 56 percent of the value at stake.\n\nFact 8: Growth in Saving\u00a0\u2260 Economic Growth; Growth in Investment = Economic Growth\n\nExtrapolating the data the survey indicated that growth in savings did not bring economic growth but the growth in investment did.\n\nFact 9: Collection of direct taxes by Indian states and Local Self Governments are significantly lower than their counterparts\n\nThe survey mentions that collections of direct taxes by Indian states and other local governments, where they have powers to collect them is significantly lower than their counterparts in other federal countries. A comparison has been given between ratios of the direct tax to total revenues of local governments in India, Brazil and Germany.\n\nFact 10: Extreme weather adversely impacts agricultural yields\n\nThe survey captures the footprints of climate change on the Indian territory and consequent adverse impact on agricultural yields. Extreme temperature increases and deficiency in rainfall have been captured on the Indian map and the graphical changes in agricultural yields are brought out from such data. The impact was found to be twice as large in un-irrigated areas as in irrigated ones.\n\nView the 10 New Facts on Indian Economy as a Graphical Presentation\n\n[slideshare id=92036092&doc=10newfactsonindianeconomybasedones2017-180327090638]",

It gives a detailed account of the various sectors of the economy and overall economic scenario of the country in the past years and provides an outline for the year ahead. Increasingly it has also become a forum for analysis and research on the economy, and hence also a source of policy ideas.\n\nWhen was the first Economic Survey of India presented?\n\nIndias first Economic Survey was presented in the year 1950-51. Up to\u00a01964, it was presented along with the Union Budget. From 1964 0nwards, it has been delinked from the Budget.\n\nWho prepares the Economic Survey?\n\nThe Economic Survey was prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Finance Ministry under the overall guidance of the Cheif Economic Adviser. After receiving inputs from the senior officers in the Ministry of Finance, the final version of the Economic Survey is scrutinized by the Finance Secretary and finally approved by the Union Finance Minister.\n\nWhen is Economic Survey presented?\n\nIt is presented every year in the Parliment during the Budget Session. The Economic Survey is presented normally a day before the presentation of the Union Budget in the Parliment by the Finance Minister.\n\nWhy is it presented before the Budget?\n\nThe Economic survey provides the assessment of overall performance of the economy during the year along with the background knowledge of the financial developments in the country. The survey was de-linked from the Budget in the year 1964 and circulated in advance so that a context of the Budget can be provided.

But deviating from its previous stand, India didn\u2019t sign the TFA pointing some other reasons. We will come to that later.\n\nNow, what is Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)? The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) was one among the 10 agreements of the deal the WTO members (including India) had agreed upon in December 2013 Bali Ministerial meeting. The TFA seeks to speed up global trade by reforming customs procedures and cutting red tape.\n\nIndia had agreed to sign the TFA by July 31st 2014, but with the change in government, we took a different stand.\n\nSo what\u2019s the big deal about TFA? We didn\u2019t sign it, so what?\n\nActually TFA is projected as the most ambitious trade agreement with the potential to generate 1 trillion dollar trade and 2 crore job opportunities. With India refusing to sign it, most of the other 159 member nations of WTO consider a \u2018TFA without India\u2019\u00a0as meaningless.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSo the hope of a global trade agreement under WTO collapsed. TFA was proposed to take effect from July 31st, 2015, but it didn\u2019t materialize.\n\nWhy India back out from TFA at the last moment?\n\nAs pointed out in the beginning, India is not against TFA. The new government under Modi, had a different concern with another agreement. It was because of some \u2018disagreements\u2019 regarding the next agreement that India backed out.\n\nOur issue was with Food Security ie. about the\u00a0Ministerial Decision on Public Stockholding for Food Security Purposes.\n\nSo there are two major issues \u2013 TFA and Food Security!\n\nThe UPA government saw these two issues separately. But the NDA government clubbed these two issues together. The new stand is something like this : TFA and Food Security deals can only be signed together. In other words, without finding a permanent solution to Food Security problem, India will not sign the TFA!\n\nThe Bali Package(2013) had 10 agreements, which can be clubbed under three heads: TFA, Agriculture (Food Security) and Least Developed Nations (LDC).\n\nWhile developed nations\u2019 primary attention was on TFA, India\u2019s concern was regarding moving ahead without finding a permanent solution to the food security issue. India has been insisting that it would not agree to the TFA unless the entire Bali package, which includes allowing developing countries to buy food from farmers for food security needs, is simultaneously firmed up.\n\nNo Permanent solution to the issue of public stockpiling for food security; but only a peace clause under the Bali agreement\n\nNew Delhi has been seeking a permanent solution to the issue of public stockpiling for food security because under the current rules, subsidies are capped at 10% of value of total production based on 1986-88 prices.\n\nIndia is close to breaching this on account of high inflation over the past few years.\n\nIndia wants inflation to be taken into account when calculating subsidy limits. The country buys rice and wheat from farmers at minimum support prices (MSP) to provide a reasonable income to producers. The stockpile is used to provide heavily subsidised food to the poor.\n\nPeace Clause under the Bali agreement\n\nPeace clause\u2019 available to India under the Bali agreement that says no member can take action against another on the food subsidy issue till a final agreement is reached on the issue, the deadline for which is the 11th ministerial in 2017.\n\nThe summary of facts relating to the stand taken by India in the World Trade Organization (WTO) recently (Courtesy: PIB)\n\nThe Bali Ministerial Declaration was adopted on 7 December 2013 on conclusion of the Ninth Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Bali. Ministerial Decisions were adopted on ten issues relating to the Doha Development Agenda which is the agenda for the unfinished Doha Round of trade negotiations, underway in the WTO since 2001.\nAmongst these Ministerial Decisions, two are of particular significance \u2014 the Ministerial Decision for an Agreement on Trade Facilitation and the Ministerial Decision on Public Stockholding for Food Security Purposes.\nThe Trade Facilitation Agreement is basically aimed at greater transparency and simplification of customs procedures, use of electronic payments and risk management techniques and faster clearances at ports. We have autonomously taken several similar measures such as the \u2018Indian Customs Single Window Project\u2019 announced in the Budget 2014-15 to facilitate trade, under which importers and exporters will be able to lodge documents at a single point, reducing interface with Governmental agencies, dwell time and the cost of doing business.\nThe Protocol of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) was to be adopted by 31 July 2014 by the WTO. After this the Agreement would automatically come into force from 31 July 2015 if ratified by two-thirds of the members of the WTO.\nIn contrast to their efforts on Trade Facilitation in the WTO, some developed countries have been reluctant to engage on other issues.\nSeeing the resistance to taking forward the other Decisions, the apprehension of developing countries was that once the process of bringing the Trade Facilitation Agreement into force was completed, other issues would be ignored, including the important issue of a permanent solution on subsidies on account of public stockholding for food security purposes.\nIndia, therefore, took the stand that till there is an assurance of commitment to find a permanent solution on public stockholding and on all other Bali deliverables, including those for the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), it would be difficult to join the consensus on the Protocol of Amendment for the Trade Facilitation Agreement.\nWithout a permanent solution, public stockholding programmes in India and other developing countries will be hampered by the present ceiling on domestic support which is pegged at 10 per cent of the value of production and is wrongly considered as trade-distorting subsidy to farmers under existing WTO rules. The existence of such a subsidy element is determined by comparing present-day administered prices with fixed reference prices of the 1986-88 period which is unrealistic.\nThe problem is a very real one. Developing countries are finding themselves hamstrung by the existing rules in running their food stockholding and domestic food aid programmes. The developed world too had market price support programmes and was able to move away from such support \u2013 though not fully even now \u2013 because of their deep pockets. This is not possible for developing countries. It is important for developing countries to be able to guarantee some minimum returns to their poor farmers so that they are able to produce enough for themselves and for domestic food security.\nDeveloped countries continue to have large entitlements to provide support to farmers. These would have been cut in the Doha Development Round which unfortunately remains unfinished. Had this Round, which has development at its core, concluded as per the agreed timelines and its development agenda, the world would have had an outcome in a single undertaking in which competing interests could have been balanced.\nToday, developing countries are fighting to keep the negotiations focused on development against the single-minded mercantilist focus of most of the rich developed world on market access issues.\nOverall balance is important even in a limited package of outcomes. The Bali outcomes were negotiated as a package and must be concluded as such.\nIt is regrettable indeed that today the WTO is unable to agree even to fast track negotiations on an issue of such importance to millions of subsistence farmers across the developing world, while the rich world can continue to subsidise their farmers unabatedly.\nThe matter came up for discussion in the margins of the BRICS Trade Ministers meeting in Brazil on 14 July and the G20 Trade Ministers meeting in Sydney on 19 July. It was also raised by the representatives of some countries in their interactions with the Indian government.\nOn each occasion, we explained that India is a signatory to the Bali Decisions, including Trade Facilitation and is not standing in the way of its implementation but is seeking an equal level of commitment and progress in working on the issue of public stockholding which affects the country\u2019s livelihood and food security.\nA permanent solution on food security is a must for us and we cannot wait endlessly in a state of uncertainty while the WTO engages in an academic debate on the subject of food security which is what some developed countries seem to be suggesting before they are ready to engage on this important issue.\nFood security is a humanitarian concern especially in these times of uncertainty and volatility. Issues of development and food security are critical to a vast swathe of humanity and cannot be sacrificed to mercantilist considerations.\nDeveloping countries such as India must have the freedom to use food reserves to feed their poor without the threat of violating any international obligations. This is our sovereign right. It is our duty to protect our citizens\u2019 fundamental rights to life and livelihood.\nAgriculture is the mainstay of the Indian population. In a country of the size of India with 60% of the population dependent on a relatively unremunerative agriculture sector, we cannot give up administered prices. This is the only way we can procure food for the Public Distribution System (PDS), the central pillar on which our efforts to ensure food security, rest. Public stockholding is a widely used means to ensure food security in many developing countries where agriculture is largely rainfed.\nWe have to look after both consumer and producer interests. We have to enable our people to live a life of dignity by ensuring access to an adequate quantity of quality food at affordable prices.\nOn 25 July 2014, India made a statement in the WTO General Council conveying, inter alia, that the adoption of the TF Protocol must be postponed till a permanent solution on public stockholding for food security is found.\nIndia offered suggestions on the procedure to be followed in order to ensure time-bound delivery of an outcome on public stockholding for food security. We also urged that a similar approach be adopted on all other elements of the Bali Package notably the LDC issues.\nThe integrity of India\u2019s stand is reflected in our unwavering efforts to offer a way forward in the face of criticism. Even on 31 July 2014, India offered a way to achieve not only a permanent solution on the issue of public stockholding for food security but also to implement the Trade Facilitation Agreement in the agreed timeframe as well as deliver favourable outcomes for LDCs.\nWe have offered practical suggestions for the way forward. The issue of a permanent solution on public stockholding is a simple one that can be addressed very easily as there are already several proposals on the table. A solution to this simple problem will be a tremendous relief for millions of farmers and poor consumers.\nHowever, despite India\u2019s efforts, our concerns were not satisfactorily addressed.\nThe Director General of the WTO reported to an informal meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee on 31 July 2014 that a solution could not be found to bridge the gap.\nThe General Council meeting was, thereafter, formally declared closed without adopting the TF protocol.\nIndia stood firm on its demands despite immense pressure. The Government of India is committed to protecting the interests of our farmers against all odds. Our farmers work in extremely adverse conditions, most of them at the mercy of the vagaries of the monsoon, aggravated today by climate change. For farmers in many developing countries farming is a subsistence activity, not a commercial one. We are committed to their welfare and there was\u00a0the support and understanding extended by farmers\u2019 organizations in this cause.\nIndia\u2019s stand has resonated across the world and some developing\u00a0countries stood by India in the VVTO.\nIndia is an unwavering votary of the multilateral trading system and we reiterate our commitment to the WTO. We continue to believe that it is in the best interest of developing countries, especially the poorest, most marginalized ones among them and we are determined to work to strengthen this institution. The timely correction of any imbalances or anomalies in the working of the system or its rules is critical to ensure that the WTO works impartially and fairly in the interest of all its Members and not just a select few.\nIndia will be able to persuade the WTO Membership to appreciate the sensitivities of India and other developing countries and see their way to taking this issue forward in a positive spirit. This would be a major contribution by this institution towards \u2018meeting the global challenge of food insecurity and would convey a strong message that the WTO is genuinely committed to the cause of development.\nConclusion\n\nYes, India backed from its previous stand, but for better reasons. TFA is most likely to help developed nations though it is projected to help developing and underdeveloped nations better.\n\nIf the betterment of developing and underdeveloped nations was the major intention, stress should be on passing the agreements on other aspects related to agriculture (food security) and LDC.\n\nIt seems India backed out for better bargaining power. Had India signed the deal on TFA, there might not arise the urgency to find a permanent solution to food security.\n\nThe present peace clause will end in 2017, and the new impositions may turn unfavourable to India. Having clubbed food security along with TFA, India now asserts that the Bali Package can be voted only together. Let\u2019s wait and see how things unfold in future.\n\nUpdate: India \u2013 US Bilateral deal to take TFA forward: Permanent Peace Clause\n\nIndia and the US have struck a deal to make TFA a reality. US proposed a permanent peace clause instead of the temporary peace clause till 2017 on food security issue.\n\nThe permanent peace clause will exist until a permanent solution to food security is agreed by member nations. This means that there will not be any legal action on India by WTO, if our subsidy crosses 10 percent of the value in 1986-1988.\n\nHaving avoided the legal action with the permanent peace clause, India has agreed with US to take the TFA forward. Once the same agreement is approved by WTO, TFA can turn as a reality.\n\nUpdate (28-11-14): WTO clears Trade Facilitation Agreement\nWTO agreed to delink \u2018negotiations for a permanent solution on public stock holding for food security purposes\u2019 from the agriculture negotiations on other issues under the Doha Development Agenda.\nThis would ensure that the negotiations for a permanent solution would continue even if the negotiations on such other issues are delayed.\n\nRead: Marrakesh agreement;\u00a0WTO and developing countries",

Be it positive or negative, whatever happens in the US has an impact on almost all countries including India. But the strength of US economy was tested thoroughly in 2008 by a crisis called a sub-prime crisis, and the results portrayed the problems of the economic structure of the US.\n\nNews about economics crisis in the US banks started to spread like forest fire. New terms like the recession, meltdown etc. made headlines in newspapers across the world. What was the reason? Let\u2019s analyze crisis situation in 2008, popularly known as Subprime Mortgage Crisis.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSub-prime mortgage crisis: What was that?\n\nThe term is associated with sub-prime lending. Many US banks had lent money to sub-prime borrowers (those borrowers who were rated below the prime borrowers), and these sub-prime borrowers failed to pay back the loans they had taken. Loans were given during real estate boom time, but when the bubble burst, banks lost most of their money. Badly affected banks include names like Lehman Brothers, Merril Lynch, and Bear Stearns.\n\nAs many of these banks closed their operations, US went into a period of recession (period of low growth) and the whole world was affected by it. US Federal bank (the supreme bank in US, just like the RBI of India) intervened and it tried everything it could do to prevent further collapse. The Fed pumped money, they bought many mortgages and gave liberal credit to other banks [Monetary Policy]. US government also made significant steps as part of their fiscal policy to control sub-prime crisis and recession. The government announced many tax cuts and started huge public expenditure programs [Fiscal Policy].\n\nFiscal Cliff Explained\n\nThe story of Fiscal Cliff starts with the subprime crisis. Hence we covered that first. US Congress ( the legislative body, similar to Indian Parliament) had passed many laws during the recession period calling for tax cuts, in-order to boost economic activity. But there was a time period specified for these exemptions. Many of these exemptions expired at midnight on December 31, 2012. So period from Jan 1, 2013, was supposed to be a period of high taxes. A sudden condition of high taxes and reduced public expenditure after a long period of tax cuts and liberal public expenditure is known as Fiscal Cliff. In the case of US, it was more a technical or policy issue, but to avoid this policy issue, the two houses of the US congress had to reach a consensus, which they didn\u2019t reach initially.\n\nTo sum up, Fiscal Cliff is the burden due to sudden increase in tax and less expenditure as mandated by some US bills (mainly a technical issue, but has practical reasons for each bill). It was the Congress to take action, but if they had not taken, US would have faced a fiscal contraction worth $600bn in 2013, which could tip the economy into a new recession.\n\n[Source My own quote : For your understanding!]\n\nReasons for Fiscal Cliff and the Possible Impact\nThe primary reason: expiry of Bush-era tax cuts.\nFiscal Cliff became a highlighted issue because of the provisions mentioned in the following bills:\u00a02010 Tax Relief Act,\u00a0Budget Control Act of 2011.\nThe\u00a0Budget Control Act of 2011\u00a0codified in law a grudging political compromise forcing the government to slash spending by $1.2 trillion over 10 years from January 1, 2013.\u00a02013 cuts, called \u201csequestration,\u201d was about $109 billion. ( Budget Control Act of US is analogous to\u00a0FRBM act of India!)\nA package of tax reductions and an extension of unemployment benefits will expire, meaning taxes will rise much for most Americans.\nTogether, higher taxes and lowered spending could slice the $1.1 trillion deficit racked up in fiscal 2012 by almost $600 billion in 2013, according to the Congressional Budget Office, vastly improving the government\u2019s financial picture. Though it might seem positive from the budget angle of government, it is a sudden and heavy burden on the people.\nThe CBO estimated the shock treatment would send the country back to recession and push the unemployment rate to 9.1 percent.\nFiscal cliff expected from Jan 1, 2013, would have resulted in Fiscal Drag.\nHow did the US avoid the fiscal cliff?\n\nThe\u00a0American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012\u00a0(ATRA) addressed the revenue side of the fiscal cliff by implementing smaller tax increases compared to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. Also, a\u00a0compromise was reached between Democrats and Republicans on January 1, 2013, regarding tax cuts. Higher income tax rates were agreed for the wealthy. Tougher decisions on spending cuts have been discussed in the Congress.\n\nFiscal Drag: What does it mean?\n\nThe first point to remember about fiscal drag is that government will get more tax revenue (mainly income tax) at the time of fiscal drag. Fiscal drag is the tendency of revenue from\u00a0taxation\u00a0to rise as a share of GDP in a growing economy.\u00a0Fiscal drag may happen due to inflation or fiscal policies of the government.\n\nFiscal drag is normally associated with progressive tax rates. Because of progressive taxes, the government will get more taxes when the economy is booming. This also\u00a0helps slow the rate of increase in\u00a0demand, reducing the pace of\u00a0growth, making it less likely to result in higher\u00a0inflation. Thus fiscal drag is an automatic stabilizer, as it acts naturally to keep demand stable.\n\nAlso note that fiscal drag means greater tax burden for people. And the greater tax burden can lead to less consumer spending.\n\nRead the second part of this article series in the link:\u00a0US debt ceiling crisis and US Federal Government Shutdown.",

    "[CONTENT] #696": "What is the debt ceiling? What are the solutions to the US debt ceiling crisis and US shutdown?\n\nThe last article from ClearIAS.com discussed about\u00a0Sub-prime crisis and Fiscal Cliff. Things didn\u2019t end there for the US economy. There were other problems to handle.\u00a0\n\nThe next two major categories of economic issues were (1) the US debt ceiling crisis and the US Federal Government Shutdown and (2) Quantitative Easing and Federal Tapering.\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the US Debt Ceiling Crisis and the US Federal government shutdown in this post and discuss Quantitative Easing in another article. So, straight to the topic.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUS Debt Ceiling Crisis\nBack to Fiscal Cliff Crisis\n$1 trillion-plus annual budget gap of US!\nWhat is Debt ceiling? Who sets this figure?\nUnited States Federal Government shut down\nSolutions to US Debt Ceiling Crisis and US Shut down\nUS Debt Ceiling Crisis\n\nDo you remember that the Fiscal Cliff was rather a technical and policy issue rather than an economic issue? Do you remember the date December 31, 2012? On the same date, another related but different problem was creating trouble for the US government. This crisis too was related to bills. And the name of the crisis: US Debt Ceiling Crisis.\n\nBack to Fiscal Cliff Crisis\n\nFiscal Cliff became a highlighted issue because of the provisions mentioned in the following bills.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n2010 Tax Relief Act.\nBudget Control Act of 2011.\n\nThe fiscal cliff crisis was partially solved with the passage of\u00a0the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012\u00a0on Jan 1, 2013. This meant that there was a compromise that taxes should not be increased beyond a limit and there should not be excessive cuts on public expenditure. But this compromise had another problem \u2013 the debt ceiling \u2013 associated with it. That too, is a self-imposed, technical, and policy issue.\n\n$1 trillion-plus annual budget gap of US!\n\nHope you are now clear about the fact that the economic condition of the US is not very good. $1 trillion-plus is the US annual budget gap (A figure which is around India\u2019s GDP). Too much budget deficit is not good for any economy. The risk of reduction of credit rating always exists. Also, there are more chances of populism. So\u00a0Budget Control Act of 2011\u00a0imposed restrictions on the debt limit of the US government. And that value was 16.399 trillion dollars.\n\nCan you think of any way of reducing the $1 trillion-plus US annual budget deficit? The usual way out is either to increase taxes or reduce spending. But this contradicts the compromise on the Fiscal Cliff crisis. Besides, the two houses of the US Congress, are on two different pages, creating a deadlock. So what to do then?\n\nWhat was needed to solve the Fiscal Cliff crisis was directly antagonistic to the solution of the US debt ceiling crisis. So it turned out that the solution to resolve the US debt ceiling crisis was not to reduce the debt, but rather increase or suspend the debt ceiling limit itself!\n\n[Source: My own quote: For your understanding!]\n\nAlso read: Debt Sustainability\n\nWhat is Debt ceiling? Who sets this figure?\nThe limit is set by Congress. The United States will not be able to borrow any more money if it crosses the debt ceiling and would, in theory, be forced to slash spending to make ends meet.\nThe debt limit does not control or limit the ability of the federal government to run deficits or incur obligations. Rather, it is a limit on the ability to pay obligations already incurred. It does not prohibit Congress from creating further obligations upon the United States. The ceiling was last set at $16.4 trillion in 2011.\nPossible, but desperate, remedies would include halting pay to the military, retirement health benefits, social security, and failing to pay government debts.\nThe US will not default on its own debt immediately. The Treasury has various extraordinary measures in its armory, including halting the issuance of securities to state and local governments, which could buy about two months of leeway.\nAfter the passing in early January 2013 of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 to avert the projected fiscal cliff, political attention shifted to the debt ceiling.\nThe debt ceiling had technically been reached on December 31, 2012, when the Treasury Department commenced \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to enable the continued financing of the government.\n\nAlso read: Public Debt: Overview\n\nUnited States Federal Government shut down\n\nFrom October 1 through 16, 2013, the\u00a0United States federal government entered a shutdown\u00a0and curtailed most routine operations after Congress failed to enact legislation appropriating funds for fiscal year 2014, or a continuing resolution for the interim authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2014. Regular government operations resumed on October 17 after an interim appropriations bill was signed into law. There was a conflict of interest on the\u00a0Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u00a0(commonly known as \u201cObamacare\u201d) between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe 16-day-long shutdown of October 2013 was the third-longest government shutdown in U.S. history, after the 18-day shutdown in 1978 and the 21-day 1995\u201396 shutdown.\n\nThe US Government shutdown was rather a budget issue appropriation issue for the new fiscal year. It was connected with the US debt ceiling, but the shutdown issue was a short-term one (connected only with the spending for the next fiscal), but the debt ceiling was a long-term problem (connected with the long-term borrowing limit.)\n\n[ Relate the Shutdown issue with a case like the Indian Budget got passed in Lok Sabha but not in Rajya Sabha; the Debt ceiling can be related to the provisions of the FRBM act which places restrictions on the Fiscal Deficit].\n\nAlso read: Budget Documents Made Simple\n\nSolutions to US Debt Ceiling Crisis and US Shut down\n\nSolution tried = Suspend the debt ceiling!\n\nThe 2013 crisis began in January 2013 and ended on October 17, 2013, with the passing of the\u00a0Continuing Appropriations Act, of 2014, though the debate continues.\nOn October 16, the Senate passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, a continuing resolution, to fund the government until January 15, 2014, and\u00a0suspend the debt ceiling\u00a0until February 7, 2014, thus ending both the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 and the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2013.\nOn January 14, 2014, the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees agreed on a spending plan that would fund the federal government for two years.\nOn January 16, 2014, Congress passed a $1.1 trillion appropriations bill that will keep the federal government funded until October 2014. (Short-term solution).\nCongress still needs to address the debt ceiling issue.\n\nRead the third part of this article series in the link:\u00a0Quantitative Easing and Federal Tapering Explained.",

    "[CONTENT] #699": "Bitcoin is a hot word these days. Many know that it is related to money or currency. But what exactly is Bitcoin? What is a cryptocurrency? Is it legal in India? Why is it in the news? Read further to know.\n\nSupreme Court of India has recently lifted the ban on cryptocurrencies imposed by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nBut why did the Reserve Bank of India warn about Bitcoins? Let\u2019s see each of these questions in detail in this article.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\nHow does Bitcoin work?\nWhat are the advantages of Bitcoins?\nArguments against Bitcoins\nWhy is RBI not an advocate of Bitcoins?\nSupreme Court of India ruling on Cryptocurrencies\nProbable Questions\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a type of digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone. It was introduced in 2009.\n\nIt is based on an open-source protocol and is not issued by any central authority. It is a peer-to-peer currency. Peer-to-peer means that no central authority issues new money or tracks transactions. These tasks are managed collectively by the network.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u201d, capitalized, refers to the protocol and transaction network whereas \u201cbitcoin\u201d, lowercase, refers to the currency itself.\n\nIt is the first decentralized digital currency.\nThey are digital coins you can send through the Internet.\nCompared to other alternatives,\u00a0they have several advantages.\nThey are transferred directly from person\u00a0to person\u00a0via the net\u00a0without going through a bank\u00a0or clearinghouse. (This means that the fees are much lower,\u00a0you can use them in every country,\u00a0your account cannot be frozen\u00a0and there are no prerequisites\u00a0or arbitrary limits.)\nHow does Bitcoin work?\nThe digital currency is generated all over the Internet by anybody running a free application\u00a0called a Bitcoin miner.\u00a0\nMining requires a certain amount of work\u00a0for each block of coins.\nThis amount is automatically adjusted\u00a0by the network\u00a0such that Bitcoins are always created\u00a0at a predictable and limited rate.\nYour Bitcoins are stored in your digital wallet\u00a0which might look familiar if you use online banking.\nWhen you transfer them, an electronic signature is added.\nAfter a few minutes, the transaction is verified by a miner\u00a0and permanently and anonymously stored\u00a0in the network.\n\nIt uses public-key cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and proof-of-work to process and verify payments. They are sent (or signed over) from one address to another with each user potentially having many, many addresses.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEach payment transaction is broadcast to the network and included in the blockchain so that the included bitcoins cannot be spent twice.\nAfter an hour or two, each transaction is locked in time by the massive amount of processing power that continues to extend the blockchain. (Bitcoin blockchain is a database that holds information about all transactions.) Using these techniques, Bitcoin provides a fast and extremely reliable payment network that anyone can use.\nWhat are the advantages of Bitcoins?\n\nAdvocates highlight the following points in favor of Bitcoins.\n\nThe Bitcoin software is completely open-source and anybody can review the code.\nIt is changing finance the same way the web changed publishing. When everyone has access to a global market, great ideas flourish.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some examples of how they are already used today:\n\nYou can purchase video games,\u00a0gifts,\u00a0books,\u00a0servers, and alpaca socks.\nSeveral currency exchanges exist\u00a0where you can trade them for dollars,\u00a0euros, and more.\nThey are a great way for small businesses and freelancers\u00a0to get noticed.\nIt doesn\u2019t cost anything to start accepting them,\u00a0there are no chargebacks or fees\u00a0and you\u2019ll get additional business\u00a0from the Bitcoin economy.\n\nBitcoins are sent easily through the Internet, without needing to trust any third party.\n\nTransactions:\nAre irreversible by design\nAre fast. Funds received are available for spending within minutes.\nCost very little, especially compared to other payment networks.\nThe supply is regulated by software and the agreement of users of the system and cannot be manipulated by any government, bank, organization, or individual.\nThe limited inflation of the Bitcoin system\u2019s money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) to miners who help secure the network.\n\nAre Bitcoins limited?\n\nThe total possible number of bitcoins is around 21 million. A bitcoin was valued at $10 in October 2012 but it leapt to around $1000 or Rs 67,000 in December 2013. Now, as of March 2020, a bitcoin is valued at around $8800 or Rs. 6,50,000.\n\nHow to get them?\n\nExchanges with local currency.\nMine.\nSell something and get bitcoins in return.\nArguments against Bitcoins\nAssets are not backed by tangible entities such as land.\nWastes computer power.\nEnables crime.\nEncourages anarchy.\nIt\u2019s very much still an experimental currency and is a high-risk environment for consumers and investors at the moment.\n\nRenowned economist Paul Krugman, is a skeptic that for example, says: \u201cSo do we need a new form of money? I guess you could make that case if the money we have were misbehaving. But it isn\u2019t. We have huge economic problems, but green pieces of paper are doing fine \u2014 and we should let them alone.\u201d\n\nIn 2014 Warren Buffett warned other investors to stay away from Bitcoin, calling it \u201ca mirage.\u201d He went so\u00a0far as saying that, even though there\u00a0may be a better way of transmitting money, the \u201cidea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke!\n\nWhy is RBI not an advocate of Bitcoins?\n\nThe RBI issued a circular in April 2019 banning regulated financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses. The ban went into effect three months later. Banks subsequently closed the accounts of crypto exchanges.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India points out that users expose themselves to potential financial, legal, and security-related risks when they deal in virtual currencies like bitcoins.\n\nIn its list of potential risks, the apex bank highlights problems such as losses arising out of hacking, no sources of customer recourse, and the general financial volatility surrounding Bitcoins.\n\n\u201cThe creation, trading or usage of virtual currencies including Bitcoins are not authorized by any central bank or monetary authority. As such, there is no established framework for recourse to customer problems,\u201d the RBI said in a statement.\n\nSeveral India-based trading platforms and exchanges have sprung up over the last six months, catering to Indian users by allowing them to purchase Bitcoin in rupees. The RBI, however, has pointed out that no regulatory approval has been obtained by any entities that carry out such activities.\n\nSupreme Court of India ruling on Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe RBI ban on cryptocurrencies was challenged in the Supreme Court by the Internet and Mobile Association of India and a few other stakeholders.\n\nIn a significant judgment (March 03, 2020), the Supreme Court on lifted the curbs on exchanges in cryptocurrency imposed by the Reserve Bank of India. The Court held that the RBI\u2019s circular preventing bans from dealing in transactions involving cryptocurrency was disproportionate.\n\n\nProbable Questions\n\nBitcoins can be a topic in UPSC Prelims, Mains, or Interviews.\n\nFor UPSC Interview: Can Bitcoins replace the Indian Rupee? If yes, explain why.\n\nFor UPSC Mains: What are bitcoins? Analyze the effectiveness of digital currency in the background of recent RBI observations.\n\nFor UPSC Prelims: Which among the following statements about bitcoins are true?\n\nIn India, RBI controls the Bitcoin market.\nBitcoins are free from inflation and deflation.\nThe total possible number of Bitcoins is limited.\nBitcoins help in preventing money laundering and illegal trading.\n\nChoices: A \u2013 1 only, B \u2013 1, 2, 4 only, C \u2013 3 only, D \u2013 All the above\n\nRead: Bitcoin halving",

Its rank crept up from 142 to 77 in the five years from 2015 to 2019.\n\nWith a rank of 77/190, World Bank now deems India an easier place to do business in than BRICs peers such as Brazil (109) and South Africa (82), however, China has a better rank (46). India\u2019s Doing Business Score is 67.23 out of 100.\n\nDoing Business Parameters \u2013 Areas India improved\n\nIndia\u2019s climb in the 2019 rankings seems to have come mainly from sharply higher scores on two \u2018doing business\u2019 indicators \u2014 securing construction permits and trading across the borders. It also made smaller improvements in starting a business and getting credit.\n\nDoing Business Parameters \u2013 Areas India is yet to improve\n\nIndia\u2019s score remains dismal on registering property, where it ranks 166.

This short analysis is a humble attempt to cover essentials one should know about the black money issue in India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDefinition of Black Money:\nBlack money is not fake notes!\nIdeal economy \u2013 accounted and legitimate transactions\nCash transactions can be black money!\nHow is black money generated in an economy?\nBlack money generation \u2013 day to day examples\nThe black money problem in India\nEstimates of Black Money in India\nIndian Black Money \u2013 Abroad or in India itself?\nCan black money be made white money?\nEffects of Black Money\nSteps to curb black money: Some recent developments\nSummary\nDefinition of Black Money:\n\nIt is to be noted here that there is no clear cut definition for black money in either economic or sociological concepts. In very simple terms we can say any money which is not accounted as one or another form of black money.\n\nBlack money is often money illegally obtained or transacted. As being unaccounted money, black money is not declared for tax purposes.\u00a0Black money is also hidden from the government authorities which calculates national income like GDP, GNP etc.\n\nBlack money is not fake notes!\n\nIt has not be understood that fake notes are not synonymous to black money. Counterfeiting is about printing\u00a0new money by unauthorized agents. Black money is not about printing new money, but is more related to tax evasion.\n\nIdeal economy \u2013 accounted and legitimate transactions\n\nIdeally all transactions where money change hands should be accounted. This helps the government to collect taxes.\n\nBut if money change hands without proper accounting (Eg: cash transactions), government may fail to notice even the presence of such money in the economy. Besides, there are many economic transactions in the countries which are by the nature itself illegal (Eg: Smuggling). These transactions can by now means taxed. All these unaccounted money can be classified under the umbrella term \u2013 black money.\n\nCash transactions can be black money!\n\nYou may wonder; but if cash change hands without proper transaction accounting, the money involved is black money!\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHow is black money generated in an economy?\nIllegitimate Activities:\u00a0Money is generated through illegitimate activities like trafficking, robbery, smuggling, terrorism, money laundering, corruption etc.\nTax Evasion: People either fail to report their tax to the authorities by virtue of ignorance or intentionally to avoid paying tax which is otherwise termed as tax evasion.\nTax Avoidance: The third scenario is about taking advantage of the legal system in a country, where individuals and companies avoid paying tax \u2013 which is called as tax avoidance.\nBlack money generation \u2013 day to day examples\n\nSome very common forms of this menace may include:\n\nSellers who don\u2019t give bills for sales creates a form of black money.\nIn the land registration process and in other reality sector business, people tend to undervalue their costs (sssets)\u00a0so as to reduce the tax and registration fees to be paid.\nPeople investing in jewelry and bullion so as to to hide their actual income. Money is also\u00a0hidden in\u00a0places like bank lockers and underground tunnels.\nNonprofit organizations, trusts, financial markets\u00a0etc are often pointed for their involvement in black money.\nTax heavens, round tripping, transfer pricing,\u00a0hawala transactions, treaty shopping etc. (to be dealt in detail later.)\nParticipatory Notes otherwise called P \u2013 Notes are another source of black money.\nTill recently bitcoins were also considered to be a source of funding of black money as it provides a safe platform for investors with handsome returns from its value appreciation.\nThe black money problem in India\n\nThe problem of black money in India started popping up by 1960\u2019s. This is mainly attributed due to the high\u00a0level of income tax and corporate tax charged then. This resulted in huge tax evasion by individuals and business communities. Now, after liberalization in 1991, the black money issue has compounded.\n\nEstimates of Black Money in India\n\nAs black money is not accounted it is not easy to estimate it either. Different reports suggests different estimates.\u00a0Some estimates are as\u00a0below:\n\nA former CBI Director of India has said that the total black money in India is around 500 billion US dollars.\nGlobal Financial Integrity Report has mentioned that\u00a0India lost around 120 billion US Dollars in the time frame of 2001-2010. It ranked India in 8th spot in black money generation.\nIndians\u2019 share in tax-havens across the world\u00a0is estimated at $152-181 billion (Rs. 10 lakh crore), by one calculation of Bank of Italy. Note \u2013 6-7\u00a0trillion dollars worth of black wealth lies hidden in tax havens across the world, according the senior economists from the Bank of Italy.\nIndian Black Money \u2013 Abroad or in India itself?\n\nThere are many experts who consider\u00a0that 90 percent of India\u2019s black money stays in India itself.\u00a0Some value it around 70 lack crore. This is because funds transferred to foreign banks\u00a0fetch very little or no bank interest. But at the same time, the booming Indian economy offers large scope for investment.\n\nAccording to one study, out of 100 rupees of black money generated in our country, 90 percent stays in India. The balance 10 percent is takes the form of\u00a0round tripping and transfer pricing; while a little\u00a0portion is consumed abroad itself.\n\nCan black money be made white money?\n\nRecipients of black money must hide it, spend it only in the underground economy, or attempt to give it the appearance of legitimacy through money laundering. Money laundering is the process by which black money is converted to white money. One of the practice involved in money laundering is round-tripping, where tax-evaded money comes back to the same country as\u00a0foreign\u00a0investment.\n\nEffects of Black Money\n\nThe after effects of black money in our economy is manifold and have serious consequences. Some of the negative impacts are listed below.\n\nIt affects the financial system of the country. RBI may not be able to control the money supply in the economy and thereby leading to higher inflation in the system. The persistent level of high inflation is detrimental to the economy as it will erode the value of money and eats up investments and savings.\nIt will affect the credibility of our country.\nThe money generated in the form of black money is often\u00a0routed for terrorism and hence, it becomes an issue of national security.\nA parallel economy will be created in the country and hence, governance will be ineffective to a large extent. We have the examples like Mexico where a parallel economy is rampant due to illegal drug trafficking.\nThere is a huge loss of money for government exchequer because of\u00a0tax loss for the country\nReal estate prices may shoot up. This may result in asset bubble which is detrimental to an economy.\nSteps to curb black money: Some recent developments\n\nDifferent steps has been formulated to curb the menace of black money in India. There were\u00a0co-ordinated efforts from the part of government, RBI, and Supreme court. Steps taken include:\n\nFormation of Special Investigation Team (SIT) by SC during\u00a0the UPA government tenure while considering a case filed by former Law Minister Shri. Ram Jetmalani.\nThe government passed The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015\nRBI initiated the process of taking back the currency notes issued before 2005 to reduce the level of counterfeit notes and also to curb the menace of black money to a greater extent.\nThe government is mulling for a dual strategy in the form of framing policies to bring back the illicit money stashed abroad and also making domestic laws stringent to locate and identify the black money in India.\nTax reforms in the form of tax deduction at source (TDS) , increasing tax base than merely increasing tax rates, voluntary disclosure schemes etc.\nGovernment and RBI are promoting the cashless economy. The government has either slashed taxes or surcharge on online / card transactions to make transfers accountable and try to bring the money into the normal banking system.\nGovernment has scrapped Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes and changed the cash withdrawal limits from banks and ATMs.\nIndia joined FATF ( Financial action Task forece)\u00a0in 2005 to combat against financing terrorism through the black money route. We also framed AML / PML laws in 2003 for combating money laundering activities in our country.\nPrevention of Corruption Act and Binami Transactions Act were other such steps in the right direction.\nUnder pressure from India and other countries Switzerland and other tax havens have agreed in principle to share the details of accounts to the public authorities on a case to case basis.\nMaking PAN number mandatory for real estate and bullion purchases.\nThe government is in a process of renegotiating DTAAs with countries which we have already signed.\nLimitation of benefits clause needs to be invoked in appropriate areas where it deemed necessary.\n2015 HSBC leak.\n2016 Panama Papers leak.\nSummary\n\nIt is to be noted here that though we have formulated different strategies and policies to combat black money, its effect is not reflected in implementation. The need of the hour is greater political will and global coordination to counter the issue.\n\nArticle by Sandeep A",

It is alleged that many of these documents show how wealthy individuals \u2013 including public officials \u2013 hide their money from public scrutiny.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPanama Papers:\u00a0What is it?\nWhat does Mossack Fonseca do?\nHow the leak was possible?\nWhat is ICIJ?\nWho are involved in the Leaked Papers?\nWhat is LRS?\nAre all people who use offshore structures crooks?\nAre some people who use offshore structures crooks?\nWhat are Tax Havens?\nWhat are Shell Companies?\nWhat is money-laundering (in a nutshell\u2026)?\nWhat is\u00a0Mossack Fonseca\u2019s take on Panama Papers?\nConclusion:\nPanama Papers:\u00a0What is it?\nIt is a set of 11.5 million documents that were leaked from a Panama-based corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca. (Note: Panama is a Central American country).\nIt is considered as the biggest leak in the history, even bigger than the WikiLeaks and the Snowden leaks.\nThe documents contain detailed information (including those of shareholders and directors, and even passport information!) about more than 2.14 lakh offshore companies listed by the agency.\nIt is alleged that the agency facilitated the rich and influential people to hide their wealth from public scrutiny, and thus evade taxation in their domestic domains.\nThe alleged perpetrators vary from current government leaders to public officials to close associates of various heads of the governments etc. The leak consists of data created between 1970s and late 2015.\nThe data primarily comprises e-mails, PDF files, photos, and excerpts of an internal Mossack Fonseca database, covering a period from the 1970s to 2016.\nThe Panama Papers leak provides data on some 214,000 companies with a folder for each shell firm that contains e-mails, contracts, transcripts, and scanned documents. The leak comprised over 4.8 million emails, 3 million database format files, 2.2 million PDFs, 1.2 million images, 320 thousand text files, and 2242 files in other formats.\n\nWhat does Mossack Fonseca do?\nMossack Fonseca is the world\u2019s fourth largest offshore law firm. It was founded by German lawyer Jurgen Mossack in 1977, and later joined by Panamanian novelist/lawyer Ramon Fonseca.\nIts Services:\nIt specializes in commercial law, trust services, investor advisory, and international business structures.\nIt also offers intellectual property protection, wealth management and maritime law services.\nMore importantly its services include incorporating companies in offshore jurisdictions such as British Virginia Islands and helping in administering such firms, for a yearly fee.\nThough it is based in Panama, it has operations and franchises worldwide, particularly in the tax havens like Switzerland, Cyprus, and British Virginia Islands (BVI) etc. It has so far acted for more than 3, 00,000 companies, including a lakh such companies in BVI alone.\nIt was also in news for Argentine money laundering controversy (K-Money); money laundering by German Commerzbank; its role in the Petrobras corruption scandal and more recently following the Panama Papers Leak.\nHow the leak was possible?\nThe documents were made available to a Munich based newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, from early 2015 through encrypted channels, from an anonymous source who was using the pseudonym John Doe.\nIt is said that the whistle blower didn\u2019t seek nothing but undisclosed security cover as compensation, as (s)he believed the company was involved in unethical business.\nThe cache of information sized around 2.6 terabytes, and Suddeutsche Zeitung sought the help of the US based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The consortium helped in distributing the documents for parallel investigation and analysis to around 107 media centres in 80-odd countries.\nWhat is ICIJ?\nIn 1997 International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, was launched by Center for Public Integrity, CPI (an American not-for-profit investigative journalism organisation. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 2014).\nIt is based in Washington and includes around 165 investigative journalists from over 65 countries.\nTheir main area of investigations include cross-border crime, corruption, accountability of the power etc.\nCPI\u2019s previous reports include those on\n\u201cWho\u2019s behind the financial Meltdown\u201d 2009,\nThe Climate Change Lobby Explosion, 2009;\nTobacco Underground, 2010;\nSecrecy for Sale: offshore accounts, 2013 to present.\nWho are involved in the Leaked Papers?\nAs per the disclosed papers, there are at least 12 national leaders among the 143 politicians or their family members or close associates, managing offshore firms, besides other famous personalities around the globe.\nSome of the more famous names are:\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Best Friend, one Sergei Roldugin, is at the centre of a scheme in which money from Russian state banks is hidden offshore.\nNawaz Sharif, the Pakistan Prime Minister\u2019s family (3 of his 4 children).\nAyad Allawi, ex-interim Prime Minister of Iraq.\nPetro Poroshenko, the in-famous President of Ukraine. He had set up a secret off-shore company in British Virginia Islands. He didn\u2019t disclose any information about the firm, while serving as the President, and hence violates the country\u2019s constitution, says anti-corruption group Transparency International.\nTwo cousins of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\nSaudi King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Bin Abdulrahman al Saud held an \u2018unspecific role\u2019, in a Luxembourg based company.\nAla Mubarak, son of Egypt\u2019s former President Hosni Mubarak.\nSigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, Prime Minster of Iceland. He was elected after the 2008 banking collapse in Iceland and had pledged to clean up corruption in the banking system. Following the leak, he announced his resignation on April 5, even while vehemently opposing any wrong-doing.\nBrother-in-law of Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nAn offshore investment fund was run by British Prime Minister David Cameroon\u2019s father.\nLionel Andres Messi, the football club Barcelona (FCB)\u2019s forward and 5-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner. His family has been accused of tax evasion.\nScandal also touches a key member of FIFA\u2019s Ethics Committee, Juan Pedro Damiani, banks like HSBC etc.\nIndians involved: the Indian newspaper represented in ICIJ consortium is The Indian Express. The Indian names (so far) revealed by the newspaper include:\nAiswarya Rai: was director/share-holder of a now dissolved company based in British Virginia Islands.\nAmitabh Bachchan: was director of one shipping firm in BVI and three in Bahamas.\nSameer Gehlaut, India bulls owner.\nKP Singh, DLF Promoter.\nVinod Adani.\nTwo politicians Shishir Bajoria from West Bengal and Anurag Kejriwal of Delhi.\n\nNote: The newspaper states that while RBI let individuals buy shares under LRS (Liberalised Remittance Scheme), it never allowed them to set up companies abroad, having clarified it through an FAQ mid-way in September 2010.\n\nWhat is LRS?\nThe legal framework for administration of foreign exchange transactions in India is provided by the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.\nUnder the Liberalised Remittance Scheme, all resident individuals, including minors, are allowed to freely remit up to USD 2,50,000 per financial year (April \u2013 March) for any permissible current or capital account transaction or a combination of both.\nThere are no restrictions on the frequency of remittances under LRS. However, the total amount of foreign exchange purchased from or remitted through, all sources in India during a financial year should be within the cumulative limit of USD 2,50,000. Once a remittance is made for an amount up to USD 2,50,000 during the financial year, a resident individual would not be eligible to make any further remittances under this scheme, even if the proceeds of the investments have been brought back into the country.\n\nWhile one is travelling abroad, on a private visit, (other than to Nepal and Bhutan), he can obtain foreign exchange up to an aggregate of USD 2,50,000 (only 3,000 as cash, rest as travellers cheque or banker\u2019s draft) in any financial year. This limit is also subsumed under LRS.\n\nAre all people who use offshore structures crooks?\nNot quite.\nIn fact, using such offshore structures and firms is entirely legal (and even promoted by many host countries).\nThere could be legitimate reasons for such investments.\nSome use it to defend \u201craids\u201d from criminals, or sometimes to get around hard currency restrictions or currency exchange restrictions.\nSometimes firms are set up to make use of favourable tax or a bilateral treaty or a free trade agreement with another country.\nOthers use offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning etc.\nAre some people who use offshore structures crooks?\nYes, more often than not, such offshore structures smacks wrong doing.\nMany a time such off shore business firms are set up in what is called as \u201cTax Havens\u201d. The motive behind the same is multifarious.\nWhat are Tax Havens?\nThey are defined as those jurisdictions in which their banks provide services primarily to non-residents and they do not require the account holders to disclose information about them or their business, more than the bare minimum.\nSuch jurisdictions offer the comfort of high privacy and opaque transactions, an impenetrable wall of secrecy.\nTax havens are invariably low-tax regimes.\nExamples: Many of such jurisdictions are small island nations (and hence the name). Examples include British Virginia Islands, Panama, Bahamas, and Macao etc.\nMany of the firms registered in such jurisdictions are \u2018Shell Companies\u201d.\nWhat are Shell Companies?\nA shell company has an outward appearance of being a legitimate firm, but it is nothing but an empty shell.\nIt helps in managing the money involved within the company, while hiding who really owns the company.\nIt is also called \u201cletter-box company\u201d, as consist of little more than an address to post to.\nSo most obvious motive behind such off-shore firms in the tax havens is to avoid taxes, in the mother country.\nThus such jurisdictions thus play an important role in large-scale money-laundering activities, corruption activities, terrorism funding, storing revenue from organised crimes etc.\nWhat is money-laundering (in a nutshell\u2026)?\n\nIt literally means laundering (cleaning) the dirty money, so that one can use it without evoking any suspicion. There are many ways to launder the money like using Bearer Bonds or paying for non-existent imports, or even buying toilet papers for a million Rupees (inflating the price).\n\nWhat is\u00a0Mossack Fonseca\u2019s take on Panama Papers?\n\nTheir press release is as below:\n\nRecent media reports have portrayed an inaccurate view of the services that we provide and, despite our efforts to correct the record, misrepresented the nature of our work and its role in global financial markets.\n\nThese reports rely on supposition and stereotypes, and play on the public\u2019s lack of familiarity with the work of firms like ours.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe Panama Papers have evoked great interest from governments and civil society around the world. While some have used the opportunity to tar capitalism as a concept promoting crooks, the debate over bringing back the illicit money has gained more traction. The data is a shot in the arm for government of India as well, which was reeling without adequate information about black money abroad. The Government has done the right thing by constituting an inter-department investigation team to look into the veracity of the leaked papers. It would also be interesting to note whether the current dispensation has the spine to take action against the Who\u2019s Who of India.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nReference and Courtesy:\n\nThe Guardian, BBC.\nThe Indian Express.\nhttps://panamapapers.icij.org\n\nArticle by: Jishnu J Raju",

    "[META] #710": "Last updated on September 13, 2023 by ClearIAS Team",
    "[CONTENT] #711": "Goods and Service Tax (GST) is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer.\u00a0GST is one indirect tax for the whole nation, which will make India one unified common market.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe benefits of Goods and Service Tax (GST)\n1. Easy compliance:\n2. Uniformity of tax rates and structures:\n3. Removal of cascading:\n4. Improved competitiveness:\n5. Gain to manufacturers and exporters:\n6. Simple and easy to administer:\n7. Better controls on leakage:\n8. Higher revenue efficiency:\n9. Single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services:\n10. Relief in the overall tax burden:\nSummary\nThe benefits of Goods and Service Tax (GST)\n\nGST is beneficial not only for the business and industry but also for the government and consumers. Here, we bring the ten benefits of Goods and Service Tax (GST).\n\n1. Easy compliance:\n\nA robust and comprehensive IT system would be the foundation of the GST regime in India. Therefore, all taxpayer services such as registrations, returns, payments, etc. would be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent.\n\n2. Uniformity of tax rates and structures:\n\nGST will ensure that indirect tax rates and structures are common across the country, thereby increasing certainty and ease of doing business. In other words, GST would make doing business in the country tax neutral, irrespective of the choice of place of doing business.\n\n3. Removal of cascading:\n\nA system of seamless tax credits throughout the value-chain, and across boundaries of States, would ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce the hidden costs of doing business.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n4. Improved competitiveness:\n\nReduction in transaction costs of doing business would eventually lead to improved competitiveness for the trade and industry. World Bank believes that the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST), combined with the dismantling of inter-state check-posts, is the most crucial reform that could improve the competitiveness of India\u2019s manufacturing sector.\n\n5. Gain to manufacturers and exporters:\n\nThe subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and comprehensive set-off of input goods and services and phasing out of Central Sales Tax (CST) would reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and services. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in the international market and give a boost to Indian exports. The uniformity in tax rates and procedures across the country will also go a long way in reducing compliance costs.\n\n6. Simple and easy to administer:\n\nMultiple indirect taxes at the Central and State levels are being replaced by GST. Backed with a robust end-to-end IT system, GST would be simpler and easier to administer than all other indirect taxes of the Centre and State levied so far.\n\n7. Better controls on leakage:\n\nGST will result in better tax compliance due to a robust IT infrastructure. Due to the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is an in-built mechanism in the design of GST that would incentivize tax compliance by traders.\n\n8. Higher revenue efficiency:\n\nGST is expected to decrease the cost of collection of tax revenues of the Government, and will, therefore, lead to higher revenue efficiency.\n\n9. Single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services:\n\nDue to multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and State, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition, the cost of most goods and services in the country today is laden with many hidden taxes. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final consumer.\n\n10. Relief in the overall tax burden:\n\nCredits of input taxes paid at each stage will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition, which makes GST essentially a tax only on value addition at each stage.\u00a0Because of efficiency gains and the prevention of leakages, the overall tax burden on most commodities will come down, which will benefit consumers. The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages.\n\nSummary\n\nGST has been so designed that credit of taxes paid at every stage of value addition from the point of manufacture to the point of consumption, can be availed at the next stage. GST is essentially a tax on value addition, and there is a seamless transfer of input tax credit across the value chain. GST will simplify and harmonise the indirect tax regime in the country.\n\nIt is expected to reduce the cost of production and inflation in the economy, thereby making Indian trade and industry more competitive, domestically as well as internationally. It is also expected that the introduction of GST will foster a common or seamless Indian market and contribute significantly to the growth of the economy. Further, GST will broaden the tax base, and result in better tax compliance due to a robust IT infrastructure. Due to the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is an in-built mechanism in the design of GST that would incentivize tax compliance by traders.\n\nReference: PIB",

(Reference \u2013 Investopedia)\n\nHow many people are part of the Gig economy?\nAs many as 30 percents of workers across the United States and Europe are thought to make up the gig economy.\nThere are five million people currently working in the gig economy in the UK according to the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI). This is around 15.6 percent of the total full and part-time workforce (31.95 million people).\nThe statistics of people involved in Gig economy in India is not very clear till now.\nWhat factors contribute to a Gig economy?\nThe comfort of working from home \u2013 In a modern digitized world, it is easy to work from home with the click of a mouse. It is independent contract work and workers don\u2019t need to go to the office for work but can work remotely from home too.\nMore choices \u2013 There is a wide range of choices for the employment seeker as well as the job provider as proximity to work place does not matter here. People also change jobs several times.\nExperimentation \u2013 Gig economy is a reflection of experimentation too.\nUncertain business climates\u00a0\u2013\u00a0As the nature of jobs is changing (eg. by automation, artificial intelligence), there is no need to hire permanent employees.\nWhy is Gig Economy preferred by workers?\nOne can also work on freelancing as well as work full-time somewhere else. Hence it is profitable to the worker as he can hit two targets together and multitask.\nIt is very beneficial for women who work on this concept when they cannot continue their work or take a break from career due to marriage or child birth.\nRetired people can also stay active after retirement as this will keep them engaged away from loneliness and depression. They can earn as well on their own rather than depending on their children or pensions.\nIt offers flexibility and diversity to the workers, unlike the monotonous full-time jobs. It offers flexibility when workers can work according to their convenience and schedule rather than routine like in full-time jobs.\nThe travel costs and energy to travel to the workplace is reduced.\nWhy is Gig Economy preferred by Employers?\nThe efficiency, efficacy and productivity of workers in gig economy are much more than that of a stable full-time job.\nMore Economical for employers\u00a0\u2013 When employment givers can\u2019t afford to hire full-time workers, they hire people for specific projects and pay them.\nStart-up companies and entrepreneurs \u2013 who do not have big financial space \u2013 can grow only if they can leverage the services of contract employees or freelancers.\nIn a gig economy, businesses save\u00a0resources in terms of benefits, office space and training. (Reference \u2013 Whatis)\nWhat are the stumbling blocks in a gig economy?\nThere is no certainty, stability\u00a0or job security in gig economy.\nWorkers can be terminated anytime here in a gig economy.\nWorkers do not have a bargaining power in a gig economy.\nWorkers do not get pensions, gratuity, perks etc that is available for full-time workers.\nThere is no basis on which banks and other financial service providers can extend lines of credit when steady income is not assured.\nThe social welfare objectives can be neglected if business and profitable avenues of freelancing are prioritized.\nIt is not accessible for people in many rural areas where internet connectivity and electricity still is a distant dream. Hence they are deprived of this opportunity and this stems up inequality debate again.\nConfidentiality of documents etc of the workplace is not guaranteed here. When there is a situation where gig worker is potentially working for others as well, including competitors, the employer is wary of what he shares with the gig worker and perennially suspicious.\nIn few work projects where teamwork is essential, gig economy becomes dysfunctional in such a scenario.\nIt is still in a nascent stage in a country like India.\nWhat is the way forward?\n\nThe UK PM Theresa May had said: \u201cI am clear that this Government will act to ensure that the interests of employees on traditional contracts, the self-employed and those people working in the \u2018gig\u2019 economy are all properly protected.\u201d\n\nThe government needs to step in, not to regulate away flexibility but to build worker and workplace protection into the system.\nOne of the biggest changes is a recommendation to change the law to redefine what a \u201cworker\u201d means.\nBasic labour welfare like minimum wages, pension etc can be paid to the gig workers.\nTraditional job descriptions should be overturned into skills-based categorizations.\nThere should be revamped of employee policy assessments and evaluations. An effective evaluation process is required to ensure consistent and quality work, where customized assessment procedures will need to be developed.\nEffectively communicating employer brand is important as communicating an authentic corporate brand is needed for traditional talent acquisition processes, even more important in a gig economy, where the foundation is built upon trust.\nIndia should learn from developed countries like the US and basic training and courses on freelancing, etc. should be provided to people.\nIndia can engage with the European Union and the United States, where discussion on protections in a gig economy is already underway.\nCompanies can introduce peer-to-peer mentoring and establish sharing platforms, both offline and online, to enable workers to connect with each other.\nCareer Avenues, choices, counselling should be available to students and workers on gig economy.\nCompanies will also need a human resource department that can manage a diverse workforce and imbue the company\u2019s culture into gig workers.\nAll casual workers must be given a full list of their rights and duties along with employment contracts in a gig economy.\nThe business, as well as welfare considerations of the people, should be well balanced.\n\nArticle by: Ipsita Mishra",

It covers a wide range of interlinked established and emerging sectors.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Nations: Blue Economy is an emerging concept that encourages better stewardship of our ocean or \u2018blue\u2019 resources.\n\nConservation International: Blue economy includes economic benefits that may not be marketed, such as carbon storage, coastal protection, cultural values, and biodiversity.\n\nThe Center for the Blue Economy: The blue economy is now a widely used term around the world with three related but distinct meanings- the overall contribution of the oceans to economies, the need to address the environmental and ecological sustainability of the oceans, and the ocean economy as a growth opportunity for both developed and developing countries.\n\nUnited Nations: It is an economy that comprises a range of economic sectors and related policies that together determine whether the use of ocean resources is sustainable. An important challenge of the blue economy is to understand and better manage the many aspects of oceanic sustainability, ranging from sustainable fisheries to ecosystem health to preventing pollution. Secondly, the blue economy challenges us to realize that the sustainable management of ocean resources will require collaboration across borders and sectors through a variety of partnerships, and on a scale that has not been previously achieved. This is a tall order, particularly for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) which face significant limitations. The UN notes that the Blue Economy will aid in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, of which one goal, 14, is \u201clife below water\u201d.\n\nWorld Wildlife Fund: For some, a blue economy means the use of the sea and its resources for sustainable economic development. For others, it simply refers to any economic activity in the maritime sector, whether sustainable or not.\u201d\n\nImportant Activities Connected to a Blue Economy\n\nThe Blue Economy encompasses activities that include:\n\n(1) Renewable Energy\n\nSustainable Marine Energy plays a vital role in social and economic development.\n\n(2) Fisheries\n\nMarine Fisheries contribute more than US$ 270 annually to global GDP. Sustainable Fisheries generate more revenue and help restore fish stocks.\n\n(3) Water Transport\n\nMore than 80 % of traded goods are transported by Sea and the rate of seaborne trade is expected to double by 2030 and quadruple by 2050.\n\n(4) Tourism\n\nOcean and Coastal Tourism can bring jobs and economic growth. More than 41 million visitors per year visit Least Developed Coastal countries and small island developing countries.\n\n(5) Climate Change\n\nThe staggering impacts of climate change include rising sea levels, Coastal Erosion, changing Ocean Current patterns, and Acidification. Oceans are an important Carbon Sink and help mitigate climate change.\n\n(6) Waste Management\n\n80% of litter in oceans is due to land-based sources.\n\nA Better Waste Management system can help revive deteriorating ocean health.\n\nIndia\u2019s Draft Policy Framework: India\u2019s Vision of New India by 2030\n\nThe Government of India\u2019s Vision of New India by 2030 highlighted the Blue Economy as one of the ten core dimensions of growth.\n\nBlue Economy was mentioned as the sixth dimension of Vision of New India 2030 stressing the need to improve the lives of the coastal communities and accelerate their development.\n\nThe objective of India\u2019s Blue Economic policy framework should be to enhance the country\u2019s GDP by promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth whilst aligning with national security goals and the international development agenda.\n\nThe potential of Blue Economy concerning India\n\nIndia has a coastline of 7517 km long, 12 major ports, and 187 non-major ports which handled about 633.87 million tons of cargo in the year 2019.\n\n95% of India\u2019s trade volume transits by sea.\n\nIndia\u2019s two million square kilometers Exclusive economy is rich in living and non-living resources and contains a substantial amount of crude oil and natural gas.\nIt can potentially enhance value addition in coastal manufacturing and services, trade, deep-sea minerals, aquaculture, and marine-related technologies.\nThe coastal economy also sustains more than 40 lakh fishermen and other significant populations of coastal communities.\nAccording to pre-pandemic OECD estimates the global Blue Economy was expected to grow double the rate of the rest of the world economy.\nIn the post-COVID-19 global scenario, India witnesses significant growth in the marine sector by efficient and sustainable utilization of ocean resources.\nThe blue economy along with the market opportunities paves the way for the conservation and development of intangible \u2018blue\u2019 resources such as carbon sequestration and coastal resilience and decision-making to help vulnerable nations to mitigate the devastating effects of climate change.\nImportant facts connected with the potential of Oceans\nThe worldwide ocean economy is valued at around US$1.5 trillion per year.\nEighty percent of global trade by volume is carried by sea.\n350 million jobs worldwide are linked to fisheries.\nBy 2025 it is estimated that 34% of crude oil production will come from offshore fields.\nAquaculture is the fastest-growing food sector and provides about 50% of fish for human consumption.\nBlue Economy vs Green Economy\n\nThe green economy is defined as an economy that aims at reducing environmental risks, and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment.\u00a0 Therefore, the blue economy is a part of the green economy.\n\nDuring the Rio+20 Summit in June 2012, Pacific small island developing states stated that, for them, \u201ca green economy was a blue economy\u201d.\n\nRead: Blue Economy 2.0",

These plans were centralized plans for economic and social development based on Soviet-era models.\n\nThe first five-year plan (1951- 1956), The Harrod\u2013Domar model served as the foundation for this strategy. It concentrated on irrigation and agriculture to increase farm output.\n\nA plan to establish five Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) as important technical institutions was one of the most significant advancements in infrastructure.\n\nSecond Five-Year Plan, The plan prioritised \u201crapid industrialization\u201d and the growth of the public sector.\n\nThe Mahalanobis model was used in the Plan. Steel and power were named as the main planning pillars.\nAlong with this strategy and the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956, which has long been regarded as India\u2019s economic constitution, there was a deliberate push for the replacement of the basic and capital goods sectors.\nThe developments included the following:\nWith assistance from the Soviet Union, Britain (the UK), and West Germany, hydroelectric power projects and five steel mills were created in Bhilai, Durgapur, and Rourkela, respectively.\nThe amount of coal produced rose.\nThe North East received more railway lines.\n\nDuring the Fourth Plan (1969\u2013 1974), the nationalization of 14 public sector banks was a significant development that had a profound effect on the Indian economy and infrastructure.\n\nThe Fifth Plan (1974-78) saw the introduction of the Indian National Highway System and the widening of numerous highways to handle the rising traffic\n\nAfter the Economic Reform in 1991, Infrastructure services in India are gradually transitioning from being under government control to being provided by the private sector.\n\nUp until 1991, the public sector dominated the private sector, which merely supported the economy.\nWith the assistance of the public and private sectors, India has experienced tremendous growth in the industrial and infrastructure sectors in recent years.\nFollowing the 1991 policy, FDI (Foreign Direct Investors) entered the industries directly and indirectly. With their assistance, India received funding and equipment to build and grew to be one of the countries that spent the most on infrastructure and industries.\nState-owned agencies are giving way to private sector companies in sectors ranging from telecommunications and highways to power and ports, allowing them to function in a competitive market and subject to economic control where necessary.\nSimilar to how protein is the lifeblood of the human body, infrastructure is an economy\u2019s \u201clifeline.\u201d An appropriate degree of infrastructure presence is a prerequisite for growth and development.\n\nThe Key areas of infrastructure development include energy, Ports, Road, Railways\u2026etc\n\nEnergy sector\n\nEnergy is one of the most crucial ties for sustainable economic progress and human development.\n\nOne of the key metrics used to evaluate a nation\u2019s economic and social growth is its per capita energy consumption.\nProfessionals agree that energy is one of the key factors boosting the economy in emerging nations like India and is a crucial component of economic development.\nThe Indian energy sector has experienced significant expansion in response to the demands of a developing country.\nMany areas have transformed, including resource exploration and exploitation, capacity expansion, and energy sector reforms.\nHowever, resource expansion and an increase in energy supply have fallen short of the demands placed on them by the expanding population, fast urbanization, and advancing economy. As a result, India continues to experience severe energy shortages and is forced to rely on imports.\nPort Infrastructure\n\nPort infrastructure is essential to every country\u2019s development.\n\nIndia has an around 7,500 km long coastline. Ports handle almost 90% of India\u2019s external trade in terms of volume and 70% in terms of value.\nIron ore, coal, crude petroleum, and other necessary commodities are all imported via the marine route.\nIndia\u2019s coastline is home to 205 minor ports and 12 major ports.\nRoad Network\n\nIndia has one of the world\u2019s largest road networks.

Read further to know more about it.\n\nIndia is a diverse and rapidly developing country with a population of over 1.3 billion people.\n\nThe Indian economy is the fifth largest in the world by nominal GDP, and it is characterized by a mixed economic system that includes elements of both socialism and capitalism.\n\nOver the past few decades, India has experienced rapid economic growth, and it is now considered to be a major player in the global economy.\n\nHowever, despite this growth, the country still faces numerous challenges, including high levels of poverty, inequality, and unemployment. In this article, we will delve deeper into the Indian economy and explore its strengths, weaknesses, and future prospects.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIndian Economy and Issues Relating to Planning\nIndian Economy and Issues Relating to Mobilization of Resources\nIndian Economy and Issues Relating to Growth\nIndian Economy and Issues Related to Development\nIndian Economy and Issues Relating to Employment\nConclusion\nIndian Economy and Issues Relating to Planning\n\nThe Indian economy has a long history of economic planning, dating back to the 1950s when the government adopted a Soviet-style central planning model.\n\nUnder this model, the government played a dominant role in the economy, setting production targets and allocating resources through a series of Five-Year Plans.\nHowever, this model proved to be relatively inflexible and inefficient, and in the 1990s, the government began to shift towards a more market-based approach.\nThis shift, known as economic liberalization, involved reducing the role of the state in the economy and opening up to more foreign investment and trade.\n\nDespite these reforms, the Indian economy continues to face several challenges related to planning. One major challenge is the lack of infrastructure, which hinders economic development and contributes to inefficiency.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe country also suffers from a high level of bureaucracy and corruption, which can make it difficult for businesses to navigate the regulatory environment and access financing.\nAnother issue related to planning in India is the challenge of balancing economic growth with social and environmental concerns. The country has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards in recent decades, but there are still large disparities in wealth and access to resources.\nAdditionally, the rapid pace of economic development has had negative impacts on the environment, including air and water pollution and deforestation.\n\nOverall, the Indian economy faces several challenges related to planning, but the government and private sector are working to address these issues and promote sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\nAlso read: Issues related to planning of the Indian Economy\n\nIndian Economy and Issues Relating to Mobilization of Resources\n\nMobilization of resources, or the process of allocating resources efficiently and effectively, is a key challenge facing the Indian economy. Several factors contribute to this challenge:\n\nLimited access to credit: Many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in India face difficulties in accessing financing from banks and other financial institutions. This can hinder their ability to invest in new projects and expand their operations.\nInfrastructure constraints: Poor infrastructure, including a lack of roads, ports, and electricity, can make it difficult for businesses to transport goods and access markets. This can limit the productivity of firms and hinder economic growth.\nSkilled labor shortages: India has a large and growing population, but there are shortages of skilled workers in certain sectors, such as technology and manufacturing. This can make it difficult for businesses to find the workers they need to grow and compete in the global economy.\nResource allocation: The allocation of resources, such as land and water, can be a challenge in India due to a complex regulatory environment and issues such as corruption and political interference.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Indian government has implemented many initiatives to improve the mobilization of resources. These include measures to increase access to credit for SMEs, investments in infrastructure, and efforts to improve the education and skills of the workforce. However, there is still much work to be done to fully unlock the potential of the Indian economy.\n\nAlso read: Issues relating to the mobilization of resources in the Indian Economy\n\nIndian Economy and Issues Relating to Growth\n\nThe Indian economy, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing, stands at the crossroads of leveraging its demographic advantage and overcoming structural challenges. Several issues need to be addressed to sustain its growth trajectory.\n\nKey Issues:\n\nEconomic Reforms: Implementation of reforms such as GST and FDI liberalization has boosted economic activity, yet uneven execution presents hurdles.\nEmployment: Harnessing the demographic dividend requires significant job creation and skill development to match industry needs.\nAgriculture: The sector, crucial for employment, faces productivity challenges due to small landholdings, inadequate technology access, and dependence on monsoon.\nInfrastructure: Despite progress, gaps in the quality and reach of infrastructure like roads, railways, and power remain, affecting business efficiency.\nFinancial Sector: Addressing non-performing assets and strengthening the banking sector are essential for financial stability and growth.\nExternal Factors: Global economic conditions and oil price volatility impact India\u2019s growth prospects significantly.\nEnvironmental Concerns: Balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability and addressing issues like pollution and resource depletion is critical.\n\nTo realize its full potential, India must navigate challenges related to employment, agriculture, infrastructure, and financial health, all while ensuring environmental sustainability. Strategic policy-making focused on inclusivity and sustainability will be pivotal in achieving comprehensive growth and development.\n\nAlso read: Issues related to the growth of the Indian Economy\n\nIndian Economy and Issues Related to Development\n\nIndia has experienced rapid economic growth in recent decades, with GDP per capita more than quadrupling since 1991. However, the country still faces several challenges related to development. Some of the key issues are:\n\nPoverty: Despite significant progress in reducing poverty, it remains a major problem in India. According to the World Bank, about 21% of the population lived below the poverty line in 2020.\nIncome inequality: India has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world, with a large gap between the rich and the poor. This can hinder social mobility and contribute to social tensions.\nUnemployment: Unemployment remains a challenge in India, especially for young people and those with lower levels of education. The country\u2019s labor force is growing faster than the number of new jobs being created, which has led to rising unemployment and underemployment.\nEnvironmental degradation: The rapid pace of economic development has had negative impacts on the environment, including air and water pollution and deforestation. This can harm the health of the population and hinder long-term economic growth.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Indian government has implemented some policies and initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth. These include measures to improve access to education, healthcare, and social services, as well as efforts to reduce pollution and protect the environment.\n\nAlso read: Issues related to the development of the Indian Economy\n\nIndian Economy and Issues Relating to Employment\n\nEmployment is a major challenge facing the Indian economy. Some of the key issues related to employment in India are:\n\nUnemployment: India\u2019s labor force is growing faster than the number of new jobs being created, which has led to rising unemployment. The unemployment rate in India was around 6% in 2020, according to the World Bank.\nUnderemployment: Many workers in India are underemployed, meaning they are working in jobs that do not fully utilize their skills or provide sufficient income. This is a particularly big problem in rural areas, where many people work in low-paying agriculture or informal sector jobs.\nSkill shortages: There are shortages of skilled workers in certain sectors of the economy, such as technology and manufacturing. This can make it difficult for businesses to find the workers they need to grow and compete in the global economy.\nLack of labor protections: Many workers in India, particularly those in the informal sector, do not have access to basic labor protections such as minimum wage, overtime pay, and job security. This can lead to exploitation and poverty.\n\nTo address these issues, the Indian government has implemented many initiatives to improve employment in the country. These include measures to improve education and training, promote entrepreneurship and small businesses, and increase access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, more needs to be done to address the underlying challenges facing the labor market in India.\n\nAlso read: Issues related to the employment in the Indian Economy\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Indian economy has made significant progress in recent decades, with GDP per capita more than quadrupling since 1991.\n\nHowever, the Indian economy and issues related to growth and development are still a challenge for the country. These include poverty, income inequality, unemployment, and environmental degradation.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Indian government has implemented several policies and initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth.\n\nThese include measures to improve access to education, healthcare, and social services, as well as efforts to reduce pollution and protect the environment.\n\nWhile there is still much work to be done, the prospects for the Indian economy are positive and the country has the potential to continue its rapid economic growth and development in the coming years.\n\nAlso read: Financialization of Indian Economy\n\nArticle written by: Vivek Rajasekharan",

Patent-protected inventions, commercial designs, and trade secrets all fall under this category.\nIntellectual property rights play a critical role in every industry and are now considered to be a key element by many businesses when making investment decisions.\nForeign businesses can protect their intellectual property in India with the support of the country\u2019s well-balanced system of IP rights.\nIndia\u2019s Intellectual Property Rights\n\nIndia is a signatory to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property and a member of the World Trade Organization (TRIPS Agreement).\n\nIndia also participates in the World Intellectual Property Organization, an organization tasked with promoting the protection of intellectual property rights globally.\n\nIndia is a signatory to the following significant IPR-related international treaties and conventions, which are overseen by the WIPO.\n\nBudapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for Patent Procedure\nParis Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property\nConvention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization\nBerne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\nPatent Cooperation Treaty\nProtocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks- Madrid Protocol\nWashington Treaty on Intellectual Property in respect of Integrated Circuits\nNairobi Treaty on the Protection of the Olympic Symbol\nConvention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms\nMarrakesh Treaty to facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities.\nNational Policy of IPR 2016\nIn May 2016, the National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy 2016 was approved as a vision statement to direct the country\u2019s future IPR growth.\n\u201cCreative India; Innovative India,\u201d is the motto of IPR Policy 2016.\nIt incorporates all IPRs and brings them together on a single platform while taking into consideration their interconnections, it attempts to foster and take advantage of synergies between all types of intellectual property (IP), relevant statutes, and government organizations.\nIt establishes a formal system for implementation, oversight, and evaluation.\nIt tries to adapt and modify best practices from around the world for the Indian context.\nThe Government of India has designated the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce, as the nodal department to coordinate, direct, and monitor the implementation and future development of IPRs in India.\nThe National IPR Policy\u2019s goals are to be carried out by the \u201cCell for IPR Promotion & Management (CIPAM),\u201d which was established under the supervision of DIPP.\nThe WTO\u2019s agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights is upheld by India\u2019s IPR regime (TRIPS).\n\nDespite having robust intellectual property rules, India\u2019s IPR system has significant flaws since they are not effectively implemented.\n\nIssues Related to India\u2019s Intellectual Property Rights\u00a0\n\nThe following are the Issues Related to Intellectual Property Rights in India-\n\nImplementation issues:\u00a0A significant hurdle is getting the judiciary and enforcement officials to address concerns with intellectual property rights on par with other economic offenses by bringing them under their policy\n\nConflicts with Overlapping Provisions:\u00a0Overprotection of intellectual property occurs when different bodies of intellectual property law simultaneously protect the same topic. It is challenging to balance private property rights in India.\n\nIntellectual creations versus public access to such inventions since such overlapping protection conflicts with the carefully formed concepts that have emerged over time.\n\nIssues related to Plagiarism:\u00a0Plagiarism is another serious problem. It is the act of taking another person\u2019s intellectual property, which includes words, slogans, designs, confidential information, and creative works of authorship, and utilizing them as one\u2019s own without acknowledging the original author or inventor.\n\nImproper enforcement of IP laws in cyberspace: On the Internet, intellectual property rights are applicable, but their enforcement is the key concern.\n\nPublishers contend that the Internet undermines their rights to intellectual property since it fundamentally alters the nature and methods of publishing, leaving their products very susceptible to online piracy.\nDue to the Internet\u2019s management being decentralized, any user can extensively disseminate work on the electronic network known as Cyberspace through a variety of means.\nAn individual can simply share a piece of art with newsgroups via email or on a personal website. The law governing intellectual property rights has caused issues for those working with advanced technology, such as computer programmers. The law stipulates that something must either be in writing to be protected by copyright or a machine to be protected by a patent.\n\nNo equivalent legislation to the Western copyright laws:\u00a0Although the Indian Copyright Act followed international norms, it has significant shortcomings when compared to Western copyright laws. Because India does not join the \u201cWIPO Internet Treaties,\u201d there is no equivalent legislation to the US DMCA in India.\n\nThe current Indian Copyright Act makes no mention of \u201ctechnological protective measures\u201d or the need to preserve electronic rights management data. The Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) contains several sections that could provide legal protection for technological measures. The IPC\u2019s Section 23 refers to \u201cwrongful gain or wrongful loss.\u201d\n\nCompulsory licensing norms:\u00a0In several cases, the Indian government has been hesitant to enforce IPR to safeguard the interests of Indian citizens.\n\nFor instance, the government may use the compulsory licensing clause to compel the patent holder or hire a third party to mass-produce a necessary drug in an emergency.\n\nEvergreening of patent:\u00a0Evergreening is a tactic for retaining royalties by prolonging the period of a granted patent that is set to expire without improving medicinal efficacy.\n\nSection 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act, which prohibits large pharmaceutical corporations from \u201cevergreening\u201d or extending the patent indefinitely by making small changes to prior patents, is another problematic topic.\n\nSubsidies and IPR issues:\u00a0In India, IPR protection in agriculture is a sensitive topic.\n\nSubsidies, such as minimum support prices for agricultural products and those for fertiliser, etc., are required to be phased out under the TRIPs agreement.\nPolitical parties are unlikely to consent to this happening anytime soon because it affects livelihoods and food security. Farmers have also expressed some opposition to transnational firms patenting seeds.\n\nProtecting Traditional Knowledge:\u00a0Traditional knowledge is like a rich mine, especially in the medical area.\n\nGOI is required to safeguard traditional knowledge by prohibiting MNCs from obtaining patents on traditional culture.\nAbove all, the government established the Traditional Information Digital Library (TKDL) to stop traditional knowledge from being patented.\n\nData exclusivity: According to claims made by foreign investors and MNCs, Indian law does not protect against the unfair commercial use of test results or other data that is submitted to the government as part of a request for the government to approve a pharmaceutical or agrochemical product for sale.\n\nThey call for a Data Exclusivity law in response.\nWith limited knowledge and weak enforcement, protecting IPRs can be challenging in India. However, preserving copyrights, trademarks, and patents is essential for innovation and advancement.\nEven so, we still lag behind nations like China despite our remarkable advancement on the industrial, scientific, and economic fronts. A culture of invention and innovation will be fostered by effective IPR protection, which may help us quickly narrow that gap.\n\nGlobal Pressure and Compliance: India faces international pressure to conform to global IPR standards, often perceived as beyond its TRIPS agreement obligations. Balancing international expectations with domestic needs and development goals is a continual challenge.\n\nWay Forward\nFor addressing IPR-related disputes, a suitable resolution process is required.\nIndia must fix any gaps in its IP laws and regulations if it is to fully benefit from the transformative advantages of a strong IP system.\nThe expansion of the innovation ecosystem with improved IPR safeguards is necessary for the success of India\u2019s flagship programs, Make in India and Startup India.\nTo encourage the Indian industry to innovate as well as to protect and enforce their ideas, there has to be greater knowledge about the development, protection, and enforcement of IPRs.\nConclusion\n\nAddressing the issues related to intellectual property rights requires a multi-pronged approach, including legal reforms, strengthening enforcement mechanisms, enhancing judicial capacities, and fostering a culture of innovation and respect for IPR.\n\nMoreover, policies need to be inclusive, considering India\u2019s developmental needs, public health concerns, and the imperative to foster innovation and creativity.\n\nTo improve efficiency and reduce the time needed to issue patents, India has implemented several improvements to its IPR framework.\n\nIn the nation, innovation culture is becoming more prominent. India is in a good position to prioritize R&D. This has resulted in an increased rating in the Global Innovation Index over time.\n\nArticle Written By: Aryadevi E S",

    "[CONTENT] #732": "Venture capital is a type of funding that provides funds to start-ups or, emerging companies in exchange for equity. Read here to learn about venture capital and venture debt.\n\nVenture capital (VC) refers to a type of private equity financing that venture capital firms or funds offer to startups, early-stage, and emerging businesses that have shown a high growth trajectory (either in terms of annual revenue or staff count) or are deemed to have high growth potential.\n\nThese businesses are funded by venture capital firms or funds in return for equity, or a share of the business.\n\nLarge organizations like pension funds, university endowments, and affluent individuals are usually the investors in venture capital firms.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nVenture Capital\nHow Venture Capital Works?\nTypes of Venture Capital\nBenefits and Risks\nVenture debt\nAdvantages and Risks of Venture Debt\nConclusion\nVenture Capital\n\nVenture capital plays a crucial role in the ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nIt provides necessary funding resources for startups that do not have access to capital markets, bank loans, or other debt instruments due to their newness, small size, or lack of tangible assets.\nVenture capital investment is often risky but offers the potential for above-average returns, which attracts investors.\nHow Venture Capital Works?\nFundraising: Venture capital funds raise money from various investors to create a pool of funds.\nInvestment: They then identify and invest in startups and early-stage companies with high growth potential. The investment is not just monetary; venture capitalists also provide mentorship, strategic advice, and networking opportunities.\nGrowth Stage: With the infusion of capital, these companies ideally grow and expand. During this phase, venture capitalists may provide additional rounds of funding.\nExit: The ultimate goal of a venture capital investment is to exit the investment at a significantly higher valuation than the entry point. Exits are typically achieved through an initial public offering (IPO) or by selling the company to a larger one (acquisition).\n\nVenture Capital Process:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDeal Origination: Venture capitalists find potential investment opportunities through networking, pitches, or referrals.\nScreening: Initial review to assess the viability, market potential, team, and product.\nDue Diligence: Comprehensive review of the business model, team, market size, and product to mitigate investment risks.\nInvestment Decision: Based on the due diligence, the venture capital firm decides whether to invest.\nPost-Investment Activities: Active involvement in the company, providing strategic guidance, financial management advice, and networking opportunities.\nExit: Through a strategic sale, IPO, or occasionally, a buyback by the company\u2019s founders.\nTypes of Venture Capital\nSeed Capital: Very early investment to prove a new idea, often before the startup has fully formed its product or business model.\nEarly Stage Financing: Investments given for product development and initial marketing. This can include Series A and Series B rounds.\nExpansion Financing: Also known as growth financing, this is capital provided to expand market reach, make significant R&D investments, or increase working capital.\nLate Stage Financing: Funding provided to companies that have reached a certain level of maturity right before IPO.\nBenefits and Risks\n\nBenefits:\n\nAccess to funds without the need to repay.\nExpertise and mentorship from seasoned professionals.\nNetworking opportunities.\n\nRisks:\n\nDilution of ownership and control.\nPressure to scale quickly and deliver high returns.\nPotential for misalignment between investors and founders.\n\nVenture capital is an essential driver of innovation, enabling cutting-edge technologies and business models to flourish. It is a high-risk, high-reward environment that demands a robust ecosystem of investors, entrepreneurs, and regulatory frameworks to thrive.\n\nVenture debt\n\nVenture debt is a type of debt financing provided to venture-backed companies that are typically in their early or growth stages.\n\nUnlike traditional bank loans, venture debt is tailored to startups and growth companies that may not yet be profitable or have sufficient assets to secure conventional loans.\nVenture debt is often provided by specialized venture debt funds or banks with venture lending arms.\nIt is used by companies as a complement to equity financing to extend their runway, finance growth initiatives, accelerate expansion, or manage cash flow without significantly diluting the equity of existing shareholders.\n\nVenture debt providers include specialized venture debt funds, banks with venture lending departments, and other non-bank financial institutions that focus on high-growth companies.\n\nThese lenders have a deep understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities faced by startups and growth companies.\n\nCharacteristics of Venture Debt\n\nCollateral: Unlike traditional loans, venture debt may not require physical assets as collateral. Lenders often rely on the company\u2019s intellectual property or future revenue potential as security.\nWarrants: Lenders may receive warrants in addition to interest payments. Warrants are rights to purchase equity in the company at a future date, at a predetermined price, providing a potential upside beyond the interest revenue.\nInterest Rates: Venture debt typically carries higher interest rates than traditional bank loans due to the higher risk associated with startups and growth companies.\nTerm: The repayment period for venture debt is usually shorter than traditional loans, often ranging from 12 to 48 months.\n\nUses of Venture Debt\n\nWorking Capital: To finance day-to-day operations without diluting ownership.\nCapital Expenditures: To purchase equipment or finance other long-term investments.\nAcquisitions: To finance the acquisition of other companies or assets.\nBridge Financing: To provide a bridge to the next equity round or to an exit event, such as an IPO or acquisition.\nAdvantages and Risks of Venture Debt\nLess Dilutive: Allows companies to raise capital without giving away as much equity, preserving the ownership stake of founders and existing investors.\nFlexibility: This can be used for a variety of purposes, offering startups flexibility in how they deploy capital.\nCost-Effective: Despite higher interest rates compared to traditional loans, venture debt can be more cost-effective than raising additional equity, especially if the company\u2019s valuation is expected to increase significantly.\n\nRisks of Venture Debt\n\nDebt Obligations: Companies must manage their cash flow carefully to meet debt service obligations, which can be challenging for startups with unpredictable revenue.\nSecurity and Covenants: Some venture debt arrangements require security against the company\u2019s assets and may include restrictive covenants that limit the company\u2019s operational flexibility.\nWarrants: The issue of warrants dilutes existing shareholders, although typically to a lesser extent than a new round of equity financing.\nConclusion\n\nVenture capital offers financial support to startups that lack access to stock markets and insufficient cash flow to incur debt. Because investors acquire stock in potential firms and businesses receive the funding they require to jumpstart their operations, this arrangement may be advantageous to both parties.\n\nVenture debt is a valuable financial tool for startups and growth-stage companies, providing a way to finance operations, growth, or strategic initiatives with less dilution than equity financing.\n\nIt is particularly useful for companies with strong venture capital backing and a clear path to profitability or exit. However, like any form of debt, it comes with obligations that must be carefully managed to avoid financial strain on the company.\n\nRelated article:\n\nStartup seed fund scheme\nInvestment models\nCrowdfunding\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

Read here to learn more about it.\n\nTax buoyancy is a measure of how tax revenues increase or decrease in response to the rise or fall in GDP, without altering the tax rates.\n\nIt is crucial to understand the effectiveness and efficiency of a tax system in generating revenue under changing economic conditions.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTax buoyancy in India\nHistorical Perspective and Recent Trends\nFactors Affecting Tax Buoyancy in India\nSignificance\nFactors Affecting Tax Buoyancy\nChallenges\nTax elasticity\nTax Elasticity vs Tax Buoyancy\nConclusion\nTax buoyancy in India\n\nTax buoyancy in India has been a subject of considerable interest and analysis, especially in the context of the country\u2019s dynamic economic environment and tax reforms.\n\nThe concept is particularly important for India as it navigates through periods of rapid economic changes, policy reforms, and efforts to enhance tax compliance and widen the tax base.\n\nConcerning the interim budget 2024, the government aims to restrict the fiscal deficit to 5.8 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as against 5.9 percent budgeted earlier for the financial year and the push to restrict the fiscal deficit target to below 4.5 percent by 2025-26 rides on the back of a strong buoyancy in tax revenues.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHistorical Perspective and Recent Trends\n\nHistorically, India\u2019s tax buoyancy has fluctuated due to various factors, including economic cycles, tax policy reforms, and structural changes in the economy.\n\nThe introduction of major tax reforms, such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017, aimed to transform the taxation landscape, enhance compliance, and improve revenue collection efficiency, thereby affecting buoyant taxation.\n\nPre-GST Era: Before the implementation of GST, India\u2019s tax system was fragmented with a plethora of indirect taxes levied by both the central and state governments. Factors like economic growth, inflation, and tax evasion influenced buoyant taxes during this period. Efforts to reform direct taxes, including moderating tax rates and broadening the base, also impacted the measure.\nPost-GST Implementation: The GST was expected to increase tax buoyancy by simplifying the tax structure, making it more transparent, and reducing the compliance burden on businesses. Initial years post-GST saw mixed results in terms of tax buoyancy, partly due to teething problems, changes in tax rates, and compliance issues. However, as the system stabilized, there was an anticipation of improved tax buoyancy reflecting better compliance and coverage.\nFactors Affecting Tax Buoyancy in India\nEconomic Growth: India\u2019s economic growth is a critical determinant of tax buoyancy. Periods of high growth have historically been associated with high buoyant taxes, reflecting increased tax collections from corporate and individual income taxes, as well as indirect taxes.\nTax Administration and Compliance: Efforts to streamline tax administration and enhance compliance, including through digitization (e.g., e-filing of tax returns, GSTN platform) and enforcement activities, impact buoyancy.\nPolicy Reforms: Tax policy reforms, including rationalization of tax rates, exemption reductions, and base-broadening measures, play a significant role in determining tax buoyancy. The introduction of the GST is a prime example of such reforms.\nInformal Economy: The size of the informal economy in India poses challenges to tax collection and affects tax buoyancy. Efforts to formalize the economy are expected to improve tax buoyancy over time.\nGlobal Economic Environment: External factors, including global economic trends and trade dynamics, can influence India\u2019s economy and, consequently, its tax buoyancy, given the impact on exports, imports, and foreign investment.\nSignificance\nEconomic Stability: High tax buoyancy indicates that the tax system can automatically stabilize the economy. During economic expansions, buoyant tax systems ensure that tax revenues increase, potentially limiting overheating. Conversely, during downturns, revenues fall, providing an automatic fiscal stimulus.\nFiscal Planning: The phenomenon is essential for government fiscal planning and budgeting. Understanding how tax revenues respond to economic growth helps in forecasting revenue and making informed decisions about spending, debt, and investment.\nPolicy Evaluation: It helps evaluate the effectiveness of the tax system and tax policy reforms. For instance, changes in tax buoyancy over time can indicate the impact of tax policy reforms on revenue generation capacity.\nAdjusting Tax Policies: A low buoyant tax could prompt governments to adjust tax policies, such as modifying tax rates or broadening the tax base, to ensure adequate revenue generation in line with economic growth.\nFactors Affecting Tax Buoyancy\nEconomic Structure: The composition of an economy (services vs. manufacturing, informal vs. formal sector) significantly influences the measure.\nTax Compliance and Administration: Efficient tax administration and high compliance rates can lead to high buoyancy by minimizing tax evasion and avoidance.\nTax Base Elasticity: The sensitivity of the tax base to economic growth affects buoyancy. For example, income taxes may be more buoyant in an economy where incomes are rapidly growing.\nTax Rate Structure: Progressive tax systems, where tax rates increase with the tax base, might exhibit higher buoyancy compared to flat or regressive systems.\nChallenges\nVolatile Revenues: Highly buoyant tax systems might lead to revenue volatility, complicating fiscal planning, especially in economies prone to frequent booms and busts.\nEquity Concerns: Ensuring that tax buoyancy does not disproportionately impact different income groups is crucial for maintaining fairness in the tax system.\nTax elasticity\n\nTax elasticity is a crucial concept in fiscal policy and economics, referring to the responsiveness of tax revenue to changes in the economic base that generates that revenue, without any alteration in tax rates.\n\nIt\u2019s a measure that helps governments and policymakers understand how tax revenues will change in response to economic growth or contraction.\nUnlike tax buoyancy, which accounts for changes in tax rates along with the tax base, tax elasticity focuses purely on the inherent responsiveness of the tax system to economic activity, holding tax laws constant.\nTax Elasticity vs Tax Buoyancy\n\nA tax is considered elastic if it is greater than 1, meaning tax revenues grow faster than the economy.\n\nConversely, a tax with an elasticity less than 1 is inelastic, indicating tax revenues grow more slowly than the economy.\nElastic taxes are sensitive to economic cycles, with revenues significantly increasing during economic booms and decreasing during recessions.\nInelastic taxes provide a more stable revenue stream across economic cycles.\n\nFormula for Tax Buoyancy\n\nIf it is greater than 1, tax revenues are growing at a faster rate than the economy, indicating a highly responsive tax system.\nIf it equals 1, tax revenues are growing at the same rate as the economy.\nIf it is less than 1, tax revenues are growing at a slower rate than the economy, suggesting a less responsive tax system.\nConclusion\n\nTax buoyancy is a vital concept for understanding the dynamics between tax revenue generation and economic growth.\n\nIt provides insights into the effectiveness of a tax system in responding to economic changes, assisting policymakers in fiscal planning and policy formulation.\n\nA well-designed tax system should aim for high buoyancy, ensuring stable and sustainable revenue generation aligned with economic growth while maintaining equity and efficiency.\n\nRelated articles:\u00a0\n\nTax transparency\nRetrospective taxation\nGlobal minimum tax\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

It is often measured using various metrics, such as the Gini coefficient or the ratio of income shares between different percentiles of the population. High levels of income inequality can have significant economic, social, and political implications. Read here to learn more.\n\nIncome inequality has declined in India with a higher tax base and a shift in taxpayers from lower income to higher income tax bracket, the Economic Research Department of the State Bank of India said in a report.\n\nAbout 36.3 percent of taxpayers have moved from lower income to higher income tax bracket resulting in 21.3 percent additional income, the report said adding that the top 2.5 percent of taxpayers\u2019 contribution in income declined from 2.81 percent in FY14 to 2.28 percent in FY21.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat Is Income Inequality?\nFactors Contributing to Income Inequality\nConsequences\nHow to measure income inequality?\nConsiderations for Measurement\nAddressing Income Inequality\nConclusion\nWhat Is Income Inequality?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nIncome inequality refers to how unevenly income is distributed throughout a population. The less equal the distribution, the greater the income inequality. Income inequality is often accompanied by wealth inequality, which is the uneven distribution of wealth.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPopulations can be divided up in different ways to show different levels and forms of income inequality, such as income inequality by gender or race.\nDifferent measures, such as the Gini Index, can be used to analyze the level of income inequality in a population.\nFactors Contributing to Income Inequality\nWage Disparities: Differences in wages and salaries across occupations and industries contribute to income inequality. Certain professions or sectors may offer higher remuneration, leading to disparities.\nEducational Disparities: Educational attainment is often correlated with income. Individuals with higher levels of education tend to have access to better-paying jobs, creating income gaps based on educational disparities.\nTechnological Changes: Technological advancements can impact the demand for certain skills. Individuals with technical or specialized skills may see higher income gains, while those with less relevant skills may face wage stagnation.\nGlobalization: Global economic integration can affect income distribution. Some argue that globalization has led to the outsourcing of jobs and wage pressure on low-skilled workers in developed countries.\nLabor Market Trends: Changes in the labor market, such as the rise of gig economy jobs, part-time work, and non-standard employment arrangements, can influence income distribution.\nInheritance and Wealth: Intergenerational transfers of wealth and inheritance can contribute to the perpetuation of income inequality, as individuals born into affluent families may have advantages in terms of education and opportunities.\nTax Policies: Tax structures and policies can either exacerbate or mitigate income inequality. Progressive tax systems that tax higher incomes at higher rates can help reduce inequality, while regressive tax policies may widen the gap.\nConsequences\nEconomic Growth: Excessive wealth inequality can hinder economic growth by limiting the purchasing power of a significant portion of the population, which can, in turn, impact demand for goods and services.\nSocial Mobility: High-income inequality may impede social mobility, making it difficult for individuals from lower-income backgrounds to move up the economic ladder.\nHealth Disparities: Studies suggest a correlation between income inequality and health outcomes. Higher levels of income inequality are associated with poorer health outcomes for the overall population.\nEducation Disparities: Income inequality can affect access to quality education. Wealthier individuals may have better educational opportunities, exacerbating disparities in skills and qualifications.\nSocial Cohesion: Excessive income inequality can strain social cohesion and lead to social unrest. It may contribute to feelings of injustice and undermine the trust individuals have in social institutions.\nPolitical Influence: Disparities in income can translate into disparities in political influence, potentially skewing policy decisions in favor of the affluent.\nHow to measure income inequality?\n\nIncome inequality can be measured using various statistical tools and indicators. Here are some commonly used methods to measure income inequality:\n\nGini Coefficient:\nThe Gini coefficient is a widely used measure of income inequality. It calculates the extent to which the distribution of income among individuals or households within a country deviates from perfect equality. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality).\nA Gini coefficient of 0 indicates that everyone has the same income, while a coefficient of 1 implies that one person or household has all the income, and others have none.\nTheil Index:\nThe Theil index is another measure of income inequality that considers both within-group and between-group inequalities. It breaks down total inequality into two components: inequality within groups and inequality between groups.\nThe Theil index is particularly useful when examining inequality among different subgroups within a population.\nPalma Ratio:\nThe Palma ratio is the ratio of the income share of the richest 10% of the population to the income share of the poorest 40%. It focuses on the relative income shares of the top and bottom segments of the income distribution.\nThe Palma ratio is especially relevant in assessing the concentration of income among the wealthiest and the distribution among the lower-income groups.\nPercentile Ratios:\nComparing income shares at different percentiles of the income distribution provides insights into how income is distributed across various segments of the population. Commonly used percentiles include the 10th, 20th, 50th (median), 80th, and 90th percentiles.\nExamining the ratio of income between the highest and lowest percentiles can offer a snapshot of the overall income distribution.\nLorenz Curve:\nThe Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of income distribution. It plots the cumulative share of total income received by the bottom x% of the population against the cumulative share of the population from the poorest to the richest.\nThe greater the distance between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality, the higher the level of income inequality.\nDecomposition Analysis:\nDecomposition analysis involves breaking down overall income inequality into its components, such as inequality within regions, industries, or demographic groups. This helps identify the sources of inequality.\nDecomposition techniques include the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition for gender wage gaps and other similar methods.\nAtkinson Index:\nThe Atkinson index measures inequality by assigning different weights to income differences at various parts of the income distribution. It reflects societal preferences regarding inequality aversion.\nThe Atkinson index is sensitive to changes in the distribution of income among the poor and the rich.\nCoefficient of Variation:\nThe coefficient of variation is a simple measure of relative income inequality. It is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of income to the mean income.\nA higher coefficient of variation indicates greater income inequality.\nIncome Shares by Quintiles:\nDividing the population into quintiles (20% groups) based on income and examining the share of total income held by each quintile provides a straightforward measure of income distribution.\nRelative Mean Deviation:\nThe relative mean deviation measures the average percentage deviation of individual incomes from the mean income. It provides information about the dispersion of income around the mean.\nConsiderations for Measurement\nPopulation Coverage: Ensure that the measurement includes the entire population or specific demographic groups.\nCurrency of Data: Use up-to-date income data to reflect current economic conditions.\nAdjusting for Cost of Living: Consider regional variations in the cost of living when assessing income inequality.\n\nChoosing the appropriate measure depends on the research question, data availability, and the specific characteristics of the population being studied. Combining multiple measures can provide a more comprehensive understanding of income inequality within a society.\n\nAddressing Income Inequality\nEducation and Skills Development: Investing in education and skills development programs to ensure that individuals have the tools to access higher-paying jobs.\nProgressive Taxation: Implementing progressive tax policies that tax higher incomes at higher rates.\nSocial Safety Nets: Establishing robust social safety nets to provide support for those facing economic challenges.\nLabor Market Policies: Implementing policies that promote fair wages, workers\u2019 rights, and job security.\nPromoting Inclusive Economic Growth: Designing economic policies that focus on inclusive growth, ensuring that the benefits of economic development are shared more equitably.\nAddressing Discrimination: Taking measures to address discrimination in the workplace, including gender and racial disparities in pay.\nWealth Redistribution: Exploring mechanisms for wealth redistribution, such as inheritance taxes or targeted social programs.\nConclusion\n\nReducing income inequality requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various factors contributing to disparities. Policymakers, businesses, and civil society play crucial roles in creating more equitable economic systems.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nGender Pay Parity\nInclusive growth\nEconomic and Social Development\nHuman Development in India\nCorporate driven Inequality\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

(CCIL) as the Central Counter Party (CCP) for guaranteed settlement, new instruments, and changes in the legal environment are some of the major aspects that have contributed to the rapid development of the G-Sec market.\n\nMajor participants in the G-Secs market historically have been large institutional investors.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWith the various measures for development, the market has also witnessed the entry of smaller entities such as cooperative banks, small pensions, provident and other funds, etc.\nThese entities are mandated to invest in G-Secs through respective regulations.\nHowever, some of these new entrants have often found it difficult to understand and appreciate various aspects of the G-Secs market.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India has, therefore, taken several initiatives to bring awareness about the G-Secs market among small investors.\n\nThese include workshops on the basic concepts relating to fixed-income securities/ bonds like G-Secs, trading and investment practices, the related regulatory aspects, and the guidelines.\nIssuance Mechanism\n\nPrimary Market:\n\nNew issuances of government securities are conducted through auctions in the primary market.\nAuctions are typically held for both Treasury Bills and Government Bonds.\n\nSecondary Market:\n\nAfter the primary issuance, these securities can be traded on the secondary market among investors.\nThe National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) are key platforms for secondary market trading.\nParticipants in the Market\nReserve Bank of India (RBI):\nThe RBI is the central bank and the primary regulator of the government securities market.\nIt conducts auctions, manages government debt, and implements monetary policy through open market operations.\nScheduled Commercial Banks:\nBanks are significant participants in the government securities market, investing in these securities to meet statutory liquidity requirements and manage their portfolios.\nPrimary Dealers (PDs):\nPDs are financial institutions authorized by the RBI to participate directly in government securities auctions.\nThey play a crucial role in market-making and enhancing liquidity.\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs):\nNBFCs are also active participants in the government securities market, investing in these instruments to manage their asset-liability portfolios.\nElectronic Trading Platforms\nNSE and BSE:\nThe NSE and BSE provide electronic platforms for the trading of government securities in the secondary market.\nElectronic trading enhances transparency and efficiency in the market.\nNegotiated Dealing System \u2013 Order Matching (NDS-OM):\nNDS-OM is an electronic platform operated by the RBI for the trading of government securities among market participants.\nWhat is a Government Security (G-Sec)?\n\nA Government Security (G-Sec) is a tradeable instrument issued by the Central Government or the State Governments.\n\nIt acknowledges the Government\u2019s debt obligation. Such securities are short-term (usually called treasury bills, with original maturities of less than one year) or long-term (usually called Government bonds or dated securities with original maturity of one year or more).\nIn India, the Central Government issues both, treasury bills and bonds or dated securities while the State Governments issue only bonds or dated securities, which are called the State Development Loans (SDLs).\nG-Secs carry practically no risk of default and, hence, are called risk-free gilt-edged instruments.\nHow are the G-Secs issued?\n\nG-Secs are issued through auctions conducted by RBI.\n\nAuctions are conducted on the electronic platform called the E-Kuber, the Core Banking Solution (CBS) platform of RBI.\nCommercial banks, scheduled UCBs, Primary Dealers insurance companies, and provident funds, who maintain funds accounts (current accounts) and securities accounts (Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) accounts) with RBI, are members of this electronic platform.\n\nExamples of government securities include:\n\nTreasury Bills (Short-Term G-Secs)\nDated Securities (Long-Term G-Secs)\nCash Management Bills (CMBs)\nState Development Loans\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)\nZero-Coupon Bonds\nCapital Indexed Bonds\nFloating Rate Bonds\nSavings Bonds\nTreasury Notes\nTreasury Bonds\nTypes of government securities\n\nTreasury Bills (T-Bills):\n\nShort-term debt instruments with maturities ranging from 91 days to 364 days.\nIssued at a discount to face value, and the return is the difference between the purchase price and the face value.\nT-Bills are essentially zero-coupon bonds, meaning they don\u2019t pay periodic interest. Investors earn returns through the difference in purchase and face value.\n\nCash Management Bills (CMBs):\n\nCash Management Bills are short-term government securities issued to manage temporary liquidity mismatches in the government\u2019s cash flows.\nThey have a maturity period of up to 91 days and are issued at a discount to their face value.\n\nGovernment Bonds:\n\nLong-term debt instruments with maturities ranging from 2 years to 30 years or more.\nPay periodic interest (coupon payments) to investors, and the principal is returned at maturity.\nMost government bonds in India are fixed-rate bonds, where the interest rate remains constant throughout the bond\u2019s life.\n\nDated G-secs:\n\nDated G-Secs are securities that carry a fixed or floating coupon (interest rate) which is paid on the face value, on a half-yearly basis. Generally, the tenor of dated securities ranges from 5 years to 40 years.\n\nState Development Loans (SDLs):\n\nSDLs are debt instruments issued by state governments to meet their financial requirements.\nSDLs function similarly to government bonds but are issued by individual states rather than the central government.\nLike government bonds, SDLs pay periodic interest to bondholders, and the principal is repaid at maturity.\n\nInflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs):\n\nIIBs are designed to protect investors against inflation. The principal and interest payments are linked to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) or Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nThese bonds offer a fixed real rate of return above inflation, providing investors with an inflation-adjusted income.\n\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS):\n\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are government securities designed to protect investors from inflation.\nThe principal amount of these securities is adjusted based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nFloating Rate Bonds:\n\nFloating rate bonds have interest rates that are linked to a benchmark, such as the government securities yield or other market rates.\nThe interest rate on these bonds is adjusted periodically, providing investors with a variable income stream.\n\nCapital Indexed Bonds:\n\nCapital-indexed bonds protect investors against fluctuations in real interest rates by adjusting the principal amount based on an inflation index.\nSimilar to IIBs, these bonds offer a fixed real rate of return above inflation.\n\nSovereign Gold Bonds:\n\nSovereign Gold Bonds are issued by the government and are linked to the price of gold.\nInvestors receive periodic interest payments, and the principal value is linked to the prevailing market price of gold.\n\nGreen Bonds:\n\nGreen bonds are issued to raise funds for environmentally sustainable projects, such as renewable energy, afforestation, or clean transportation.\nThese bonds attract investors interested in contributing to environmentally responsible initiatives.\nAdvantages of Investing in Government Securities\n\nInvesting in government securities offers several advantages, such as:\n\nSafety: Government securities are considered risk-free investments due to the government\u2019s creditworthiness and guarantee of repayment.\nRegular Income: These securities provide regular interest payments, offering a steady income stream to investors.\nDiversification: Government securities can diversify an investment portfolio by reducing overall risk.\nLiquidity: These securities can be easily bought and sold in the secondary market, ensuring liquidity for investors.\nTax Benefits: Certain government securities offer tax benefits, such as tax exemption on the interest earned.\nChallenges\n\nMarket Liquidity:\u00a0 Ensuring liquidity in the government securities market is an ongoing challenge. Illiquidity can affect the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission.\n\nParticipation of Retail Investors: Encouraging greater participation of retail investors in the government securities market remains a challenge.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe government securities market in India is expected to continue evolving with advancements in technology, changes in market structure, and the introduction of new financial instruments. The market\u2019s resilience and its ability to adapt to changing economic conditions will be crucial for maintaining stability in India\u2019s financial system.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nPublic Debt\nCapital Market\nFinancial Market\nMonetary Policy of India\nIndian Financial System\nWays and Means Advances\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish",

Shells, berries, wings of butterflies, and beetles were all used with great ingenuity.\n\nWith the advance of civilization, the materials changed to copper, ivory, agate, and semi-precious stones, and later to silver, gold, and diamonds.\n\nDuring the Indus Valley civilization, various ornaments like rings, head ornaments, brooches, and girdles were found, mostly they were melted or refined, molded or chiseled, designed, and cast.\nGreek and Hellenistic styles were found in the Gandhara period, archaeologists have found massive earrings, torques, and armlets incorporating bird or animal forms.\nCrest Jewel, crowns, studs, hoops, jimmikis, chains, chokers, ropes of pearls and beads, armlets, bangles, bracelets, nose rings, rings on fingers and toes, girdles and anklets were found during the golden age of India that is during the Gupta Empire.\nBy the time, when the Britishers ruled we could print all kinds of jewelry designs in a catalogue.\n\nThe country\u2019s rich and varied history has given rise to a wide array of jewelry styles, each reflecting the unique cultural and artistic expressions of different communities.\n\nJewelry in India is crafted from a variety of materials, including gold, silver, precious and semi-precious gemstones, and even beads. Techniques such as enameling, filigree work, Kundan setting, and meenakari (enameling on gold) are integral to Indian jewelry making.\nTemple jewelry, characterized by intricate motifs of deities and divine symbols, has its origins in South India. It is often used for classical dance performances and is inspired by the architecture of temples.\nKundan and Polki jewelry, known for their elaborate settings of uncut diamonds and precious gemstones, have been a traditional favorite in North India, particularly in states like Rajasthan.\nOriginating in the Mughal era, Jadau jewelry involves embedding gemstones into gold using a technique known as kundan setting. It is prevalent in regions like Rajasthan and Gujarat.\nDhokra is a traditional metal-casting technique, and Dhokra jewelry, with its rustic and tribal appeal, is crafted using this ancient art form.\nNavratna jewelry features nine gemstones representing the nine planets, each believed to have astrological significance. This style is prevalent in both North and South India.\nFiligree is a delicate metalwork technique, and states like Odisha and Andhra Pradesh are known for their intricate filigree jewelry, often crafted from silver.\nGems and Jewelry Industry\n\nThe Gems and Jewellery sector plays a significant role in the Indian economy, contributing around 6-7 percent of the country\u2019s GDP.

It incorporates all institutional and functional parts of the market structure of the system and is driven by technical and financial factors.\n\nIt is the main method of moving agricultural products from farms to markets and a variety of urban neighborhoods.\nThe process of agricultural marketing entails acquiring, storing, preparing, shipping, and delivering various farmed supplies across the nation.\nAgricultural marketing, which is a part of the larger marketing system, refers to all of the actions, organizations, and regulations producers take to acquire farm inputs and transport agricultural products from farms to consumers, manufacturers, and exporters.\nIt should offer customers food of acceptable quality at prices they can afford, remunerative pricing for farmers, and sufficient margins for middlemen to ensure their continuing involvement in the trade.\nThe growth of the agricultural industry as a whole depends on agricultural marketing.\nPaying farmers fairly and profitably for their agricultural output gives farmers financial security.\nAdditionally, it guarantees that food goods are accessible and affordable to consumers, which lowers inflation.\nThe flow of agricultural goods from producer to consumer is handled by an extensive system known as agricultural marketing.\nAgriculture marketing is carried out in India through several central government agencies, including the Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices, the Food Corporation of India, the Cotton Corporation of India, the Jute Corporation of India, etc.\nAdditionally, there are organizations dedicated to the marketing of rubber, tea, coffee, tobacco, spices, and vegetables.\nImportance of Transport and Marketing of Agricultural Produce\n\nAgriculture and transportation, Both of these sectors of the economy, are dependent on one another, as are these two industries.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe marketing of agricultural products is significantly impacted by dependable and effective transportation infrastructure.\nAgricultural products differ from industrial goods in that they have distinctive characteristics, making transportation availability and quality equally important.\nFor instance, agricultural products are bulky and perishable. Almost all of them are consumable goods.\nThe objects must be protected from damage during transit with proper packing and transportation.\nOn the other hand, the farmer may maximize his or her revenues if efficient transportation infrastructure is in place and agricultural output is handled with care.\nHowever, low unit pricing and a robust agriculture value chain may be maintained via an efficient transportation and marketing system.\nTransporting goods affordably allows producers to make a profit while also making them available to customers.\nContrarily, if transportation costs are high, not only will local marketing suffer but so will the possibility of exporting agricultural products to countries with more efficient transportation.\nTransport creates a market for agricultural goods, enhances communication between geographical and economic regions, and creates new areas of economic focus.\nOver 3 million employees will be created as a result of an investment of Rs 89,375 crore in the development of reliable post-harvest storage and transportation.\nLow-quality rural transportation will affect productivity, income, and level of living.\nThe primary focus of agricultural marketing is the purchase and sale of agricultural goods.\nAny agricultural product\u2019s ability to be sold depends on several variables, including the product\u2019s current demand and storage space accessibility.\nBetter marketing for farmers can guarantee higher pricing for the produce and protection from price swings.\nManufacturers want farmers to supply them with the most affordable, highest-quality produce possible so that they can sell it for a profit.\nThe best products and services from the manufacturer or farmer, at the most affordable pricing, are what traders and retailers seek.\nCustomers are looking for high-quality goods at reasonable pricing.\nA successful marketing strategy will lessen the need for government purchases at MSP, aiding in fiscal consolidation.\nTransportation constraints for agricultural produces\n\nThe main obstacles to moving agricultural products in India include a lack of infrastructure, support, and logistics connectivity to guarantee farmers\u2019 timely delivery of their yield to markets.\n\nIndia has very poor transportation facilities. Only a few villages are connected to mandies by railways and pucca roads.\nProduce must be transported on cumbersome conveyances like bullock carts.\nSuch transportation cannot be employed to convey products to locations too far away, so the farmer must discard his harvest in neighbouring marketplaces, even if the price he receives there is quite poor. With regards to perishable goods, this is much more true.\nLack of transportation choices that can go farther distances more quickly, but are highly expensive and time-consuming; lack of services like mobile cold storage for fresh perishable products that cannot be stored at production centres yet requires rapid transfer.\nGiven the perishable nature of the fruit, there have been restrictions on its marketing connected to direct marketing, assurance of greater returns, reliance on the weekly haat, and wholesale market known as mandi.\nActions Taken to Improve Transportation\n\nKisan rails are the first multi-commodity trains in the world.\n\nThese chilled freight trains will help in the quick delivery of perishable agricultural products like fruits and vegetables to markets.\nThese will make sure that agricultural products are transported across the entire nation.\nThe air transport of agricultural commodities proposed by Krishi Udan.\nAs a result, value realization (on agricultural items) would greatly increase, especially in the northeast and tribal areas.\n\nThe Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) programme aims to help with the marketing of agricultural products as well as the international portion of freight.\n\nKisan Rath mobile application (app) to allow transportation of foodgrains and perishables during the lockdown.\n\nConstraints of Transport and Marketing of Agricultural Produce\n\nThe primary flaws of the agricultural marketing system are addressed here.\n\nInsufficient Warehouses\nThe settlements lack adequate warehouse facilities. In order to store his goods, the farmer is forced to employ trenches, mud vessels, \u201cKutcha\u201d storehouses, etc. These illogical storage techniques result in a great deal of waste.\nThe amount of produce that goes bad and cannot be eaten by humans is about 1.5%. As a result, there is a significant increase in supply in the village market, which makes it difficult for the farmers to obtain a reasonable price for their goods.\nThe situation has improved to some extent after Central Warehousing Corporation and State Warehousing Corporation were established.\nLack of Standardization and Grading\nDifferent types of agricultural produce are not adequately graded. The \u201cDara\u201d sales practice, in which a large quantity of the produce of all grades is sold in a single lot, is the one that is most frequently used.\nAs a result, the farmer producing superior goods cannot be certain of receiving a higher price. Therefore, there is little motivation to use superior seeds or create superior kinds.\nExistence of a Large Number of Middlemen:\nThe agricultural market has a very extensive network of middlemen, which significantly reduces the share of farmers.\nMistakes in Unregulated Markets\nThe country still has a sizable number of unregulated markets. Arhatiyas and brokers take advantage of the farmers\u2019 ignorance and illiteracy to defraud them through unscrupulous methods.\nFarmers must pay the arhat (pledging charge) to the arhatiyas, the \u201ctulaii\u201d (weight charge) for weighing the produce, the \u201cpalledari\u201d (other miscellaneous types of allied work) to unload the bullock carts, the \u201cgarda\u201d (for impurities in the produce), and several other unspecified and undefined charges.\nLack of Market Information:\nIt is frequently impossible for farmers to learn the exact market pricing in various markets. As a result, they agree to pay whatever the traders offer.\nThe government often broadcasts market prices on radio and television to address this issue. The news publications also inform farmers of the most recent pricing adjustments.\nInadequate Credit Facilities:\nIndian farmers try to sell their products as soon as the crop is harvested even if the prices are quite low at that time due to their poverty.\nSteps taken to improve Transport and Marketing of Agricultural Produce\neNAM\n\nTo integrate all regulated wholesale produce marketplaces through a pan-India trade site, the government built the electronic national agriculture market (eNAM).\n\nAGMARKNET\n\nIt is an e-governance platform that makes it easier to generate and transmit pricing, as well as commodity arrival information from agricultural produce markets, and to swiftly and transparently disseminate such information online to farmers, consumers, dealers, and policymakers.\n\nKisan Credit Card Program\n\nTerm loans are offered for agricultural requirements.\n\nFormation and Promotion of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)\n\nThis is to encourage specialization and better processing, marketing, branding, and export of agricultural produce. FPOs will be supported within the \u201cOne District One Product\u201d cluster.\n\nMIEWS Portal\n\nMarket Intelligence and Early Warning System to give farmers advice on how to avoid cyclical production and an early warning in cases of gluts.\n\nRead:\u00a0Agricultural Marketing Reforms: Model APMC Act and NAM\n\nRecent legislation related to the Storage, Transport and Marketing of Agricultural Produce\n\nRecent laws governing the storage, transportation, and marketing of agricultural products\n\nThe Centre recently passed three laws about agriculture, even though this is a State topic because trade and commerce are under its purview. As follows:\n\nFarm Services Act and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement Act of 2020:\n\noutlines contract farming, in which farmers produce crops under contracts with corporate investors in exchange for a price that is mutually agreed upon.\n\nPromoting and Facilitating Farmers\u2019 Produce Trade and Commerce Act 2020 :\n\nliberates farmers by allowing them to sell wherever they want.\n\nAmendment to the Essential Commodities Act of 2020:\n\nto strike potatoes, onions, grains, pulses, oilseeds, and edible oils off the list of vital goods.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe largest industry in our nation is agriculture, followed by transportation. The national economy and these two businesses both rely on one another. Road transportation is essential for the distribution of agricultural products because it is the primary method of moving agricultural products from farms to markets and different urban neighborhoods. The farmer\u2019s earnings may be maximized if effective transportation infrastructure is in place and agricultural output is handled carefully.\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S",

It is a sector-specific government intervention program designed to give one sector preferential treatment over others.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPolicymakers identify sectors that merit support from the government and establish goals for them. Government support for the production of renewable energy, organic farming, food processing, and product export promotion has already been observed. These all fall under the industrial policy.\n\nInstruments of Industrial Policy\u00a0\nTariffs, non-tariff barriers, and subsidies are used.\nTariffs are customs duty barriers used to shield a nation\u2019s domestic sector from outside competition. It unfairly inflates the price of imported goods while favoring domestic producers.\nSimilar to tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions (also known as non-tariff barriers) place limits on the number of imports by setting quotas. These two limits were rather tight before 1990.\u00a0\nNeed For an Industrial Policy\nIndustry knowledge spillover impacts the economy to a certain extent. Sector-to-sector differences in this effect\u2019s strength. A new industry will draw people with the necessary talent, skill, and competence, which will grow over time. In other words, concentrating on one particular industry over time might lead to a whole industrial complex that benefits from mutual synergies and economies.\u00a0\n\u00a0When India gained its independence, the majority of its industries were nonexistent or in their infancy. They were unable to effectively utilize economies of scale or adopt new technologies. In this situation, early government protection is preferred so that a competitive industry can emerge afterward.\u00a0\nAn industry cannot exist or endure by itself. It needs other industries that supply it with raw materials at fair prices and levels of quality. The survival of this industry also depends on the existence of numerous other industries that will serve as consumers.\u00a0\n\u00a0A certain level of assurance in the future of the entire economy and that industry, in particular, is necessary for setting up an industry. Investors are reluctant since there is a legitimate risk involved. In the case of being the \u201cfirst mover\u201d in a recently opened sector, this risk and uncertainty are substantial.\u00a0\n\u00a0Contrarian arguments\nSpecial interests influence them in some way. In every economy, pressure organizations are vying for the government\u2019s resources. They attempt to persuade decision-makers to seize a larger than justifiable portion of natural and economic resources.\u00a0\nUncertainty exists in this regard.\u00a0Any industrial policy needs to anticipate future economic developments. Our experience has shown us that the economy is the hardest to anticipate, making planning and policymaking efforts frequently ineffective.\u00a0\nGovernment support affects pricing by distorting markets and production patterns. Prices serve as signals for both customers and producers, informing them of what to buy and make. Therefore, because of government protection and assistance, producers are unable to adopt new markets or technologies. This makes them uncompetitive.\u00a0\nAnother viewpoint, held by some notable economists, advocated for aiding India\u2019s traditionally labor-intensive handicraft industry and agro-economy (based on the Gandhian model). In this scenario, markets would handle heavy industries. However, the Mahalanobis model was chosen by the Congress government, and the discussion of this decision is still ongoing.\u00a0\nInstead, the Nehru Mahanaboli model required a lot of capital. At that period, there was a great attraction for heavy industry. Investment in heavy industry was encouraged by the development and high standard of living experienced by developed nations.\u00a0\nChanges in Industrial Policy\n\nBefore independence, India had no developed industrial sector. It was an agricultural nation where handicrafts gained an unparalleled level of supremacy. There are very few economic sectors that have grown into traditions that can be classified as having items made using the factory system in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nIn Independent India, the Parliament occasionally enacted different resolutions. Still, a historic change occurred in 1991 when India was obliged to open its economy to international competition and the government was forced to deregulate sectors to make room for private industry.\n\nHere are a few significant changes to the Indian industrial strategy.\n\nIndustrial Policy \u00a01948\n\nBoth the public and commercial sectors were involved in industrial growth in the 1948 Industrial Policy Resolution. As a result, the industries were split into four major groups:\n\n(a) Exclusive governmental monopoly \u2013 This pertains to the production of weapons and ammunition, the creation and management of atomic energy, as well as the ownership and operation of railway transportation.\n\n(b) Government Monopoly for New Units \u2013 This category includes coal, iron, and steel, shipbuilding, aircraft manufacturing, telegraph manufacturing, wireless device manufacturing (except radio receiving sets), mineral oils, and shipbuilding.\n\n(c) Regulation \u2013 This grouping includes sectors with such fundamental importance that the central government would consider it necessary to plan and regulate them.\n\n(d) Unregulated private enterprise: The private sector, both individual and cooperative, was allowed to operate in the industries in this category.\n\nResolution on Industrial Policy from 1956\n\nThis was done to give the mixed economy model and the socialist socialism doctrine a more tangible form. The entire industrial sector was divided into three Schedules by the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956:\n\nSchedule A: The first category featured industries whose future development was solely the State\u2019s responsibility.\nSchedule B: Industries that were becoming increasingly state-owned and in which private firms were solely expected to support government initiatives were included in this category.\nSchedule C: The third group includes all industries that weren\u2019t listed in schedules A or B.\nSmall-Scale Sector: Several initiatives were suggested in the policy resolution to support the small sector.\nInvestment from abroad is permitted.\nThe 1969 Act Against Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practices\n\nThe controversial \u201clicense quota permit\u201d system was typified by this action. Before expanding or starting operations, companies with assets worth more than a certain amount were required to obtain approval or a license.\n\nIts goals were to:\n\nto forbid monopolistic and limiting business practices (except by the government)\nto avoid the monopolization of economic power by a select few\nto manage monopolies\nResolution on Industrial Policy from 1977\n\nThis resolution was the outcome of the center-level government shift. As a result, it placed more emphasis on cottage, small-scale, and village industries. This marked a shift in ideology from the Nehruvian-Mahalanobis school to the Gandhian school of economic growth.\n\nThis divided the tiny sector into the following three groups:-\n\na) Home and cottage enterprises, which offer several opportunities for independent work.\nb) A small industry with investments in industrial units with machinery and equipment up to Rs. 1 lakh that is located in towns with less than 50,000 residents\nc) Small-scale enterprises, which include industrial units with an investment of up to Rs. 10 lakh, and ancillaries with an investment of up to Rs. 15 lahks in fixed capital.\nResolution on Industrial Policy, 1980\n\nAfter making a comeback, Congress quickly reinstated its industrial strategy.\n\nThe main changes were:\n\nCertain goods designated for small-scale industries were taken from the reserve list.\nMany businesses and units were using more capacity than was permitted by law. These overflowing capacities were made regular.\nIt was possible to invest abroad with technology transfer.\nRegulations, licensing, and limits were loosened slightly, indicating a preference for the private sector.\n1991\u2019s New Industrial Policy\n\nThe industrial policy that has guided the nation\u2019s industrial growth since independence underwent a significant adjustment in 1991. The nation decided to adopt capitalism. According to the new system, planning shifted from \u201cimperative\u201d to \u201cindicative.\u201d\n\nL \u2013 Liberalization (Reduction of government control)\n\nP \u2013 Privatization (Increasing the role & scope of the private sector)\n\nG \u2013 Globalisation (Integration of the Indian economy with the world economy)\n\nThe New Industrial Policy\nIndustrial licensing policy \u2013 The New Industrial Policy abolished all industrial licensing, regardless of investment level, except a select group of 18 industries related to security and strategic concerns, social concerns, the use of hazardous chemicals, overriding environmental concerns, and luxury goods.\nPublic Sector Policy \u2013 The 1956 Resolution designated 17 industries as part of the public sector. This number decreased to 8 under the Industrial Policy of 1991. Currently, the government solely controls three sectors: 1) Atomic Energy 2) Atomic mineral mining 3) Rail Transportation\nReconstruction (BIFR), or other such high-level organizations developed for the purpose, of a social security mechanism will be established to safeguard the interests of workers who are likely to be impacted by such rehabilitation measures.\nPrivatization/disinvestment: The government declared its plan to offer mutual funds, financial institutions, the general public, and employees a portion of its ownership stake in public sector firms.\nLimitations on Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practices: All businesses categorized as MRTP firms under the Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practice Act have assets exceeding a particular threshold (Rs. 100 crores since 1985). Only certain industries were open to such firms, and even then, case-by-case clearance was required.\nPolicy on Technology Agreements and Foreign Investment: To automatically grant authorization for direct foreign investment up to 51 percent foreign equity, the New Industrial Policy identified a list of high technology and high investment priority industries.\nAbolishing Phased Manufacturing Programs for New Projects \u2013 These programs were designed to help develop indigenous technology.\nRemoval of Mandatory Convertible Provision \u2013 Before financial liberalization, the loan agreement with the borrower contained a mandatory convertible clause (industries in this case). This clause gave banks the freedom to turn any amount of their loans into equity at any time. This will change their status in that business from \u201clender\u201d to \u201cowner.\u201d The government utilized this clause as a tool to nationalize private businesses.\nRepercussions of New Policies\n\u201cLicense, Permit and Quota Raj\u201d was abolished in 1991 according to a new policy. Lowering administrative barriers to industrial expansion aimed to liberalize the economy.\nThe public sector\u2019s limited engagement lessened the burden on the government.\nThe policy included flexible licensing, the lifting of the asset cap on MRTP enterprises, easier access for foreign corporations, and privatization.\nAll of this led to more competition, which in turn led to decreased pricing for numerous things, including electronics. This led to both domestic and foreign investment in practically every industry that was made available to the private sector.\nSpecial export-boosting measures were made in the wake of the strategy. Export Export-oriented units, Export Processing Zones, Agri-Export Zones, Special Economic Zones, and most recently National Investment and Manufacturing Zones are ideas that have been used in the past. All these have benefitted the export sector of the country.\n\u00a0Limitations of\u00a0 India\u2019s industrial policies\nManufacturing Sector Stagnation: India\u2019s industrial policies haven\u2019t been able to boost the manufacturing sector, whose share of GDP has been hovering around 16% since 1991.\nIndustrial pattern distortions brought on by selective investment inflow: The slow pace of investment in many basic and strategic industries, such as engineering, power, machine tools, etc., is of concern.\nEmployment displacement Worker displacement resulted from the restructuring and modernization of industry as a result of the new industrial policy.\nLack of incentives to increase efficiency: Internal liberalization received more attention than trade policy reforms, which led to \u201cconsumption-led growth\u201d rather than \u201cinvestment- or export-led growth.\u201d\nVaguely defined industrial location policy: The New Industrial Strategy highlighted the negative impacts of environmental harm but failed to specify an industrial location policy that could guarantee the establishment of an industrial climate free from pollution.\nWay ahead\n\nSince 1991, industrial policies in India have shifted from being primarily socialist in 1956 to becoming capitalistic.\n\nIndia today has an industrial policy system that is much more liberalized, focusing on boosting foreign investment and reducing regulations.\nIn the 2018 World Bank Report on Doing Business, India was rated 77th. The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act of 2017 and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms are noteworthy and will benefit the manufacturing sector in the long run.\nMake in India and Startup India campaigns have improved the business environment in the nation.\nHowever, difficulties with lending, labor rules that result in high unit labor costs, political involvement, and other regulatory burdens remain obstacles to business expansion.\nA new Industrial Policy is required to strengthen the nation\u2019s manufacturing sector. The government should feel the necessity to unveil a new Industrial Policy that would serve as a guide for all commercial firms in the nation.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Levying and collecting direct taxes as well as developing other direct tax regulations fall within the purview of the Central Board of Direct Taxes.\n\nA taxpayer may be required to pay a direct tax to the government for several different reasons, including real estate taxes, personal property taxes, income taxes, asset taxes, gift taxes, capital gains taxes, and others. One of the government\u2019s two primary sources of income is direct taxation.\n\nThe other is indirect tax. Direct taxes generate around half of the government\u2019s revenue each fiscal year. The government sets fiscal year-specific goals for direct tax collection to raise income.\n\nExamples of Direct Tax\n\nExamples of direct tax include Income tax, corporation tax, minimum alternate tax, capital gain tax, securities transaction tax, commodities transaction tax, alternate minimum tax, estate duty, wealth tax, gift tax, and fringe benefit tax.\n\nINCOME TAX\nIncome tax is levied on individuals, Hindu undivided families, unregistered firms, and other groups of people.\nIn India, the income tax system is progressive.\nAll forms of income are aggregated and taxed by the individual\u2019s income tax brackets.\nDepending on the amount of net income, different rates of income tax are applied. For instance, if net taxable income is between Rs. 5 and 7.5 lakhs, an income tax of 10% is levied.\nThere is a 10% surcharge on income tax in cases when the total income is greater than Rs 50 lakh but not greater than Rs 1 crore.\n\nNote: Agricultural income is not subject to tax.\n\nCORPORATION TAX\nIt is a tax levied against the earnings of businesses and corporations. Additionally known as corporate tax.\nA company must pay a separate tax from its owner\u2019s income tax since it is recognized as a separate entity for tax purposes.\nBoth public and private companies that are registered in India under the Companies Act 1956 are required to pay corporation tax.\nAll domestic enterprises must pay corporation tax at a rate of 22% as of January 2022.\nMINIMUM ALTERNATE TAX\nBy utilizing the various incentives and exemptions made available by the Income-tax Act, businesses with high profits and sizable dividends to shareholders who were not paying corporate tax to the government were required to pay a set percentage of book profit as minimum alternate tax, according to the concept of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT).\nAs a result, the government levies an advance tax on these companies called the Minimum Alternate Tax, or MAT. Businesses must therefore pay at least a specified amount of tax.\nAccording to the Income Tax Act, a portion of a company\u2019s booked earnings is automatically deemed taxable income, and tax is required if the company\u2019s taxable income is less than a specific percentage of those profits.\nThe rate of MAT is 15% as of January 2022.\nCAPITAL GAIN TAX\nAny profit or gain realized from the sale of a capital asset is referred to as a capital gain.\nTaxation is imposed on capital sale profits.\nCapital assets include things like land, structures, homes, jewelry, patents, and copyrights.\nA capital asset held for less than 36 months is referred to as a short-term capital asset.\nLong-term capital asset \u2013 An asset that has been held for longer than 36 months is referred to be a long-term capital asset.\nThe 36-month minimum for immovable property (land, buildings, and houses) has been lowered to 24 months as of FY 2017\u201318.\nFor instance, if you sell a house after owning it for 24 months, any income you receive if you do so after March 31, 2017, will be regarded as a long-term capital gain.\nTransportable items are free from this adjustment, though, including jewelry and mutual funds that invest in debt.\nThey will be categorized as long-term capital assets if held for some time greater than 36 months.\nDepending on the amount of income received, different capital gains taxes are applied to short- and long-term profits.\nSECURITIES TRANSACTION TAX\nGains on securities including shares, options, and futures traded on the domestic stock exchange are subject to a tax known as the securities transaction tax.\nIt is a direct tax that the federal government imposes and collects.\nDuring his tenure as finance minister, P. Chidambaram introduced the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) first in 2004.\nCOMMODITIES TRANSACTION TAX\nIn India, the exchange-traded non-agricultural commodity derivatives buyers and sellers are both subject to the commodity transaction tax.\nBased on the size of the contract, it is determined.\nCommodities covered by CTT include non-farm items including metals (gold, silver, and copper) and energy products (crude oil and natural gas).\nALTERNATE MINIMUM TAX\nAlternate Minimum Tax (AMT) is to limited liability partnerships what Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) is to corporations.\nOther commercial entities, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and associations of people, are exempt from this tax.\nESTATE DUTY\nIt was initially presented in 1953. When a person passes away, it is imposed on all of their possessions.\nThe entire estate of the decedent is regarded as his wealth and is taxable.\nThe tax hasn\u2019t been in place since 1985.\nWEALTH TAX\nIt was initially shown in 1957.\nIndividuals, combined Hindu families, and companies with a surplus of net value were subject to it.\nWef 2015, the tax was abolished.\nGIFT TAX\nIt was initially released in 1958.\nThe only donations exempt from the gift tax were those made by public and private organizations that support charitable institutions.\nThe tax hasn\u2019t been collected since 1998.\nFRINGE BENEFITS TAX\nTo reduce the profit on booked entries, many businesses provide their staff with various bonuses and maintain them below their input cost.\nAs a result, there is less profit, which lowers government taxation.\nThe Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT), which is effectively a tax that an employer must pay instead of the benefits granted to his or her employees, was enacted by the government as a response to this.\nIt was an effort to tax all perks that were being used to avoid paying taxes.\nThe fringe benefits tax was eliminated in India\u2019s Union budget for 2009.\nAdvantages of Direct Tax\nEconomic Balance: To achieve economic and social balance, the government establishes tax brackets based on an individual\u2019s income and age. The tax rate is determined by the nation\u2019s economic situation. People are given exceptions to balance out economic inequalities.\nEnsures equality: For the government to help the poor and vulnerable in society, higher taxes must be paid by people and enterprises with higher profits. This keeps the economy in balance.\nGives Certainty: The direct tax gives both the government and the taxpayers confidence because both parties are aware of the exact amount of tax that must be paid and collected.\nAddresses inflation issues: In times of high inflation, the government boosts taxes to reduce demand for goods and services, which causes inflation to decline.\nMakes Government Accountable: People are aware that paying taxes is necessary. As a result, he or she is involved in the government\u2019s use of taxes and is aware of his or her rights. By doing this, accountability for the government is ensured.\nDisadvantages of Direct Tax\nCan be easily evaded: Not everybody wants to pay taxes. Some people are willing to file a false tax return to avoid paying taxes. These people can simply conceal their income since they are not subject to state law.\nTax slabs are arbitrary: If taxes are progressive, they are set at the Finance Minister\u2019s discretion. If it is proportional, it significantly burdens the underprivileged.\nObstructs growth: High taxes discourage people from investing and saving, which hurts the nation\u2019s economy. It harms enterprises and industries by impeding their expansion.\nInconvenience: A direct tax\u2019s major drawback is that it hurts the taxpayer. He senses that his hard-earned money has been stolen away when a large sum is taken from his pocket. Direct tax payment is therefore rather inconvenient.\nIndirect Tax\nIndirect taxes are levied against the party who will ultimately bear the financial burden of the tax through the use of an intermediary.\nThe taxpayer has the option to transfer it to another party.\nThe middleman creates a tax return and sends the government\u2019s tax revenue with it.\nIn this regard, an indirect tax is distinct from a direct tax, which is paid by the government directly to the people (whether legal or natural) who are subject to it.\nInstead of using a person\u2019s income, indirect taxes are calculated using their expenses.\nSuppliers of products and services are subject to indirect taxes, but consumers are ultimately responsible for paying them.\nExamples of Indirect Tax\n\nExamples of Indirect tax include customs duty, sales tax, excise duty, service tax, value-added tax, and dividend distribution tax.\n\nCUSTOMS DUTY\nCustoms duties are imposed as a tariff or fee when goods are transported across international borders.\nIts objective is to protect the nation\u2019s economy.\nUnder customs regulations, several different types of duties are levied, including Basic Duty, Countervailing Duty, Protective Duty, Anti-Dumping Duty, and Export Duty.\nImport taxes are used to control business as well as to bring in money for the government.\nAd valorem calculations are used in India to determine import taxes.\nA national indirect tax known as GST (Goods and Services Tax) is levied on the production, sale, and consumption of goods and services.\nAll indirect taxes imposed on products and services by the federal and state governments have been replaced by it.\nSALES TAX\nA sales tax in India is a sort of tax that the government imposes on the sale or purchase of a certain good inside the nation.\nBoth the federal government and the state governments impose a sales tax.\nIGST has since taken its place.\nEXCISE DUTY\nExcise duty is a commodities tax in the true sense of the word because it is levied on the production of goods rather than their sale in India.\nThe federal government levies a clear excise duty on all goods except alcoholic beverages and illegal drugs.\nCGST has since taken its position.\nSERVICE TAX\nAll rendered services in India are subject to a service tax.\nA service tax was introduced in 1994\u20131995 on three services: stockbroking, general insurance, and telephone services.\nSince then, the service net has been wider as new services are added every year. We now have an exclusion criterion known as a \u201cnegative list,\u201d where certain services are not included in the tax net.\nBefore being replaced by the Goods and Services Tax, the service tax rate in India was 15%.\nVALUE ADDED TAX\nBecause of the way it is designed, the VAT does away with distortions.\nAs a result, VAT has been imposed in all of India\u2019s states and union territories (except UTs of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep).\nThe state determines the amount of the tax, which is levied on a range of goods sold in the state.\nState Sales Tax had been replaced with State VAT, which was in effect until July 1, 2017.\nSGST has since taken its position.\nDIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION TAX\nA dividend is a payment made from a company\u2019s profits in a certain year to its stockholders. Dividends are income in the eyes of the shareholders, hence they ought should ideally be taxable.\nThe amount of dividends given to shareholders is the basis for the tax that the Indian government imposes on Indian firms.\nWhen DDT was originally made available in 1997, it was governed under Section 115 O of the Income Tax Act.\nIn Budget 2020, the Finance Minister got rid of the Dividend Distribution Tax.\nNow that corporations are no longer required to pay dividend taxes, individuals must.\nAdvantages of Indirect Tax\nEveryone can contribute: Indirect taxes are levied on everyone who purchases a product, unlike income taxes, which are paid by some income groups but not by others. Tourists and persons from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who are not employed in India must pay it because they will buy items in some capacity.\nIndirect Taxes are convenient: They are quite practical when it comes to collecting indirect taxes. Customers do not feel forced to spend such small amounts even though taxes may be extremely cheap. Additionally, they are an affordable fee that is included in the cost of the goods sold.\nThey are unavoidable: Indirect taxes cannot be avoided because they are part of the product\u2019s price. Anyone who buys the good will therefore be liable for the tax.\nThey cover a wide range: The consumer will notice and suffer greatly if a service or product is heavily taxed on only one characteristic. Because they are applied to more products and are paid in smaller sums in this situation, indirect taxes may be favorable.\nDisadvantages of Indirect Taxes\nIndirect taxes have the potential to be regressive: It can be argued that it is unfair to the poor because everyone pays the same indirect tax. Indirect tax is imposed on all purchases, and while the wealthy may be able to pay it, the poor will also be responsible for it. Indirect taxes may therefore be viewed as regressive.\nThey are inflationary in effect: The precise percentage of tax that applies to every item that a seller sells might not always be possible to calculate and collect. To ensure that every customer pays the indirect tax, they purposely charge more than the tax amount. But over time, this drives up the cost of commodities.\nThey do not raise civic consciousness: Because they are buried in the price, millions of people who pay indirect taxes aren\u2019t even aware that they are doing it, which lowers civic consciousness.\n\nAlso read: Tax buoyancy\n\nDifference Between Direct and Indirect Taxes\n\u00a0 Parameter\n\t\nDirect Tax\n\t\nIndirect Tax\n\n\nMeaning\n\t\nLevied directly on the individuals or corporations.\n\t\nLevied on one entity but is passed on to the final consumer\n\n\nIncidence\n\t\nThe incidence and impact of the direct tax fall on the same person.\n\t\nThe incidence and impact of the tax fall on different persons.\n\n\nNature\n\t\nProgressive\n\t\nRegressive\n\n\nAdministrative Cost\n\t\nHigher\n\t\nLower\n\n\nTax Evasion\n\t\nPossible\n\t\nNot possible\n\n\nExamples\n\t\nIncome Tax, Wealth Tax, and Corporation Tax.\n\t\nExcise duty, VAT, entertainment tax, Customs Duty, GST\nCess and Surcharge\n\nThe Union Government imposes cess and surcharges as taxes to generate revenue for administrative costs. Even though cess and surcharge increase the government\u2019s revenue, they differ in many ways.\n\nCess\nIn its most basic form, a cess is a levy on tax.\nIt is crucial to keep in mind that a cess may only be used for the intended purpose.\nFor instance, the Indian government only utilizes money collected from an education cess for education.\nFurthermore, all taxpayers must pay this tax.\nTo the Consolidated Fund of India, cess taxes are paid.\nIn general, cess is anticipated to be levied up until the government has a strong enough reason to do so and to disappear after that reason has been achieved.\nSince a cess is imposed in addition to the present tax, it differs from other taxes like excise duty and income tax (tax on tax).\nFor instance, adding a 5% education tax to a 20% income tax will increase the entire tax to 21%. (20% base tax + an additional 5% cess).\nThe main cesses that are currently in effect are those for education, roads, infrastructure, clean energy, Krishi Kalyan, and Swachh Bharat.\nSurcharge\nIndividuals with net taxable salaries of more than Rs 1 crore are subject to a 10% surcharge on their tax obligations.\nIf net income is between Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore, domestic corporations must pay a surcharge of 5%. 10% of the net revenue over Rs 10 crore is subject to a surcharge.\nIf the net income is between Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore, a 2% surcharge is imposed on international firms.\nThe surcharge is raised to 5% if the net income surpasses Rs 10 cr. If the net income surpasses Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore, both domestic and foreign enterprises receive a margin of relief.\nA tax surcharge on income is a significant source of funding for the state.\nThe Union Government may use this money for any purpose it sees fit.\nIt\u2019s important to note that just the tax that must be paid, not the entire income, is covered.\nThe Consolidated Fund of India receives this payment, which may be used for any purpose.\n\nA 10 percent surcharge on a 30 percent income tax rate, for example, brings the tax burden to 33 percent.\n\nBenefits of Taxes\n\nDifferent types of taxes in India are intended to give the government money for expenditure while preventing inflation. Various types of income, including wages, business profits, rental income from real estate, and others, are subject to taxation.\n\nWealth taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, payroll taxes, value-added taxes, service taxes, and so on are additional taxes.\n\nTypes of taxes in India are used by the government for several things, including:\n\nPublic sector investment for infrastructure\nprojects for welfare and development\nDefense budget\nUsing data from scientific studies, public insurance\nGovernment and state workers get a range of pay.\nthe running of the public transportation network of the government\nUnemployment benefits\npension schemes\nthe application of the law\n\nExamples of public utilities include systems for managing garbage, water, electricity, and public health.\n\nConclusion\n\nDifferent types of taxes in India therefore have both benefits and drawbacks, but there is no denying that they are necessary to raise money. While the wealthy can pay direct taxes, the poor have the chance to make a small contribution through indirect taxes.\n\nThere is a lot of potential to change things by controlling these tax systems. These factors make a nation\u2019s taxation system crucial to its economy.\n\nRead:\u00a0Tax buoyancy\n\nArticle written by: Remya",

The country is improving access to clean water, sanitation, and affordable clean energy.\nIndia has also boosted access to social protection for vulnerable sections of society, especially during and after the pandemic, with a 9.8 percent increase in the budgetary allocation to the Social Services sector in 2021-22 over 2020-21.\nHuman Development in India\n\nHuman development in India remains a dynamic and evolving process. The government, civil society, and international organizations continue to work towards addressing disparities, enhancing access to basic services, and improving the overall well-being of its diverse population.\n\nChallenges such as poverty, healthcare access, and education quality require ongoing efforts and policy initiatives.\n\nHealth\n\nIndia has made significant progress in increasing life expectancy. Factors such as reduced child mortality rates and advancements in healthcare have contributed to longer life expectancies.\nChallenges in Healthcare: Despite progress, India faces challenges in providing equitable healthcare access to all citizens. Disparities in healthcare infrastructure and services exist between urban and rural areas.\nPublic Health Concerns: India faces health challenges related to communicable diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), non-communicable diseases (e.g., diabetes), and maternal and child health. Malnutrition remains a significant concern, particularly among children.\n\nEducation\n\nIncrease in Literacy Rates: India has made notable progress in increasing literacy rates, with a particular focus on improving female literacy. Government initiatives like \u201cSarva Shiksha Abhiyan\u201d have aimed to provide universal elementary education.\nQuality of Education: While there have been improvements in enrollment, concerns remain regarding the quality of education, school infrastructure, and access to higher education. Disparities in educational outcomes persist.\n\nEconomic development\n\nEconomic Growth: India has experienced rapid economic growth over the past few decades, contributing to increased income levels and reduced poverty rates.\nIncome Inequality: Income inequality remains a challenge, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, and among different states and regions.\n\nGender equality\n\nWomen\u2019s Empowerment: There have been advances in women\u2019s empowerment, including increased participation in the workforce and political representation. Gender-based violence and discrimination, however, continue to be concerns.\nFemale Education: Promoting female education is considered a key factor in advancing gender equality.\n\nAccessibility\n\nClean Water and Sanitation: Efforts have been made to improve access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities, but disparities still exist, particularly in rural areas.\nHousing and Infrastructure: Access to adequate housing and infrastructure services like electricity and roads varies widely across the country.\n\nCultural plurality\n\nIndia\u2019s rich cultural diversity and pluralism contribute to the country\u2019s human development. However, issues related to social exclusion, caste-based discrimination, and religious tensions persist.\n\nUrbanization\n\nRapid urbanization has posed both opportunities and challenges, with urban areas experiencing greater access to services and economic opportunities, but also facing issues like overcrowding and environmental pollution.\nGovernment programs like \u201cMGNREGA\u201d aim to improve rural livelihoods and infrastructure.\n\nSustainable development\n\nIndia is increasingly focusing on sustainable development, addressing environmental issues, and promoting renewable energy sources to combat climate change.\nEconomic development vs Human development\n\nEconomic development and human development are related but distinct concepts often used to assess a country\u2019s progress and well-being. In the case of India, both dimensions have seen significant advancements, but challenges remain.\n\nEconomic development primarily focuses on the growth of a nation\u2019s economy and the improvement of material well-being.\nHuman development goes beyond economic indicators and encompasses broader aspects of well-being, including health, education, and quality of life.\n\nThe disparity between human development and economic development in India is a complex issue with multiple contributing factors.\n\nWhile India has experienced significant economic growth in recent decades, improvements in human development indicators, such as education, healthcare, and living standards, have not kept pace.\n\nInequality: India grapples with high levels of income and wealth inequality. Economic growth has disproportionately benefited certain segments of the population, leading to a widening wealth gap. This inequality can limit access to quality education, healthcare, and other essential services for a large portion of the population.\nHealthcare Disparities: Despite economic growth, access to quality healthcare remains limited in many parts of India, especially in rural areas. High out-of-pocket healthcare expenses can push families into poverty, and preventable diseases continue to affect a significant portion of the population.\nEducation: While India has made strides in increasing literacy rates, the quality of education remains a concern. A large number of children attend schools with inadequate infrastructure, underqualified teachers, and outdated curricula. This affects the overall development and employability of the workforce.\nGender Disparities: Gender inequality continues to hinder human development in India. Discrimination against women and girls in terms of access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities limits their contribution to the workforce and overall development.\nMalnutrition and Food Security: Malnutrition remains a critical issue in India, particularly among children. Poor nutrition during the early years of life can have long-term impacts on physical and cognitive development.\nSanitation and Clean Water: Access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities is uneven across India. Poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water can lead to health issues and hinder human development.\nSocial and Cultural Factors: Deep-rooted cultural norms and social hierarchies can perpetuate disparities in access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Discrimination based on caste, ethnicity, and religion can limit the development prospects of marginalized groups.\nRegional Disparities: India is a vast and diverse country with significant regional disparities in human development. States in the southern and western regions tend to have better human development indicators compared to states in the northern and eastern regions.\nGovernment Priorities: The allocation of government resources and policy priorities can affect human development outcomes. Shifts in public spending and policy focus are necessary to address disparities.\nInfrastructure Gaps: Inadequate infrastructure, including transportation, electricity, and digital connectivity, can limit economic opportunities and access to services in rural and remote areas.\nWay forward\n\nIndia\u2019s international contributions to sustainable development continue to grow.\n\nA leader of the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure, India is a champion of South-South cooperation and emerged as a major global supplier of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.\nIndia\u2019s climate leadership is demonstrated by its ambitious targets and commitment to net zero by 2070.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest democracy is also fast-tracking the implementation and monitoring of the SDGs at the national and sub-national levels to meet the ambitious goals.\n\nAddressing the gap between economic development and human development in India requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and cultural factors contributing to disparities.\n\nIt involves targeted investments in healthcare, education, and social welfare programs, along with efforts to promote gender equality and reduce inequality. Additionally, regional and local disparities need to be addressed through tailored development strategies.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ.

From being considered a \u2018developing country\u2019 for decades, India has emerged as one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economies. The journey has been characterized by landmark reforms, robust GDP growth, and a shift from agrarian dominance to a diversified economy.\n\nWhen we study the economic development of India, we need to grasp the complexities of India\u2019s economic evolution. The 1991 economic liberalization marked a turning point, dismantling the License Raj and opening doors to foreign investment. This period underscores the significance of pragmatic policymaking, as it laid the foundation for subsequent growth.\n\nHowever, challenges such as poverty, unemployment, and income inequality persist. We must engage ourselves with evolving strategies to address these issues, such as the \u2018Make in India\u2018 initiative, the Goods and Services Tax (GST), and initiatives for financial inclusion like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.\n\nSocial Development: Empowering India\u2019s Diversity\n\nWhile economic progress is vital, sustainable development is incomplete without social inclusivity. We need to understand the intricacies of India\u2019s diverse social fabric is paramount.\n\nInclusive Governance\n\nThe Indian Constitution\u2019s emphasis on social justice has paved the way for transformative policies. Social development initiatives like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) have provided a safety net for rural citizens, tackling both poverty and unemployment. Moreover, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act underscores the commitment to protecting marginalized communities.\n\nGender Equality\n\nPromoting gender equality is an integral part of India\u2019s social development narrative. Initiatives like the Beti Bachao, and Beti Padhao campaign aim to bridge gender gaps in education and employment. Additionally, the representation of women in local governance through Panchayati Raj Institutions showcases the role of grassroots democracy in empowering women.\n\nSynergy Between Economic and Social Development\n\nThe intricate interplay between economic and social development is undeniable. A growing economy provides the necessary resources to fund social welfare programs, while an empowered populace becomes a potent driver of economic growth.\n\nAdministrators must focus on improving the education system and skill development initiatives. The \u2018Digital India\u2019 campaign, coupled with the National Skill Development Mission, aligns with this vision, aiming to equip the youth with 21st-century skills.\n\nHealthcare forms the bedrock of a productive society. Schemes like Ayushman Bharat exemplify the integration of economic and social priorities, offering financial protection during medical emergencies while improving the overall health index of the nation.\n\nSustainable Development\n\nSustainable development is the compass guiding the nation\u2019s journey towards a future that balances economic progress with environmental stewardship and social inclusivity.\n\nAt its core, sustainable development is about meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nIn India\u2019s context, it\u2019s an approach that seeks to balance economic growth with environmental protection and social equity.\n\nEnvironmental Conservation: A Prerequisite for Progress\n\nIndia\u2019s natural beauty and biodiversity are invaluable assets.

Small actions like conserving water, reducing waste, and supporting eco-friendly products contribute to the larger goal.\n\nSustainable development isn\u2019t a luxury; it\u2019s a necessity. India\u2019s path to prosperity is intricately linked with its commitment to preserving its environment, uplifting its people, and embracing responsible growth. By fostering a holistic approach that weaves together economic, environmental, and social well-being, India is sowing the seeds for a future where development thrives without compromising the planet or leaving anyone behind.\n\nRead more about sustainable development\u2026\n\nPoverty\n\nAmidst the vibrant colours, rich culture, and dynamic progress, India grapples with a persistent challenge: poverty.\n\nThere are families struggling to make ends meet, children missing out on education, and individuals lacking access to basic healthcare. Poverty transcends mere economics; it impacts human dignity and potential.\n\nCauses and Complexity\n\nPoverty rates are generally higher in rural areas compared to urban areas. Rural poverty is often linked to factors such as limited job opportunities and inadequate access to education and healthcare.\n\nPoverty\u2019s roots are deep and intertwined with various factors:\n\nUnemployment: Lack of job opportunities, especially in rural areas, leads to income instability.\nUnderemployment: Many are trapped in low-paying, unstable jobs that fail to provide a decent living.\nLack of Education: Illiteracy perpetuates poverty by limiting access to better job prospects.\nHealthcare Disparities: Poor health leads to decreased productivity and increased medical expenses.\nSocial Discrimination: Marginalized communities face limited opportunities due to societal biases.\nImpacts on Society\n\nThe impact of poverty extends beyond individual lives:\n\nEducation Gap: Poverty often denies children access to education, perpetuating the cycle.\nHealthcare Challenges: Poor living conditions and inadequate nutrition lead to health issues.\nCrime and Unrest: Poverty can contribute to social unrest and criminal activities.\nInequality: The gap between the rich and the poor widens, affecting social cohesion.\nGovernment Initiatives: A Ray of Hope\n\nThe Indian government recognizes the urgency of addressing poverty and has introduced several initiatives to tackle the issue:\n\nNational Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA): Provides employment opportunities in rural areas, aiding income stability.\nPradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY): Aims to provide affordable housing for urban and rural poor.\nJan Dhan Yojana: Financial inclusion program to ensure access to banking services.\nMid-Day Meal Scheme: Provides nutritious meals in schools, boosting attendance and health.\nCivil Society and Non-Governmental Efforts\n\nNumerous NGOs and grassroots organizations work tirelessly to combat poverty. Their efforts include education programs, vocational training, healthcare initiatives, and community development projects.\n\nTowards a Brighter Future\n\nThe road to eradicating poverty is challenging, but progress is evident:\n\nEconomic Growth: India\u2019s growing economy can create more jobs and opportunities.\nEducation Focus: Emphasis on education can break the cycle of poverty.\nSocial Programs: Effective implementation of social welfare programs can uplift marginalized communities.\n\nPoverty is a complex issue that requires multidimensional solutions. India\u2019s journey towards prosperity involves addressing unemployment, inequality, and access to basic services. By weaving social and economic safety nets, fostering education, and supporting inclusive policies, we can create a society where every individual has the opportunity to escape the clutches of poverty and live a life of dignity and promise.\n\nRead more about poverty in India\u2026\n\nInclusion\n\nInclusion is the act of ensuring that every individual, regardless of their background, enjoys equal rights and opportunities.\n\nThe concept of inclusion forms the bedrock of India\u2019s ethos.\n\nIn this post, we delve into the concept of inclusion in the Indian context, exploring its significance, challenges, and strides forward.\n\nEqual Access to Opportunities\n\nIn a truly inclusive economy, everyone has an unobstructed path to opportunities. From education to entrepreneurship, access must be unrestricted by gender, caste, religion, or socio-economic background. When barriers are dismantled, a more diverse and skilled workforce emerges, propelling innovation and economic growth.\n\nFinancial Inclusion\n\nInclusion in the economic realm extends to financial accessibility. Programs like the Jan Dhan Yojana have brought millions into the formal banking system, giving them a chance to save, invest, and plan for the future. This empowerment contributes to poverty reduction and economic stability.\n\nSocial Cohesion\n\nInclusion in society fosters a sense of belonging and shared purpose. When individuals from different walks of life interact, understanding deepens, and prejudices weaken. This kind of cohesion is crucial in a country as diverse as India, where unity amidst diversity is a national strength.\n\nEmpowerment of Marginalized Communities\n\nInclusion takes on a transformative role when it empowers marginalized communities. Affirmative action policies and targeted programs uplift those historically left behind, creating a more equitable social landscape. Empowerment through education, skill development, and access to resources bridges gaps and drives social progress.\n\nGender Disparities\n\nDespite progress, gender disparities remain a challenge. Women\u2019s access to education, employment, and decision-making roles is often limited. Inclusive policies that promote gender equality are vital to harnessing the full potential of society and the economy.\n\nRural-Urban Divide\n\nThe rural-urban divide in India reflects uneven access to opportunities and services. Inclusive development means bridging this gap, ensuring that the benefits of progress reach every corner of the nation.\n\nEducation for All\n\nInclusion starts with education. Every child, regardless of background, deserves access to quality education. This prepares them to be active contributors to the economy and informed citizens in society.\n\nEmployment Opportunities\n\nPromoting inclusion in the economy involves creating job opportunities that accommodate diverse skill sets. Inclusive workplaces that value diversity foster innovation and productivity.\n\nInclusion isn\u2019t just a concept; it\u2019s a commitment to building a society and economy that leaves no one behind. As India marches towards its goals of economic growth and social progress, the thread of inclusion must be woven through every policy, program, and initiative.\n\nInclusion ensures that every voice matters, every talent is nurtured, and every dream is achievable. It\u2019s not just about unity in diversity; it\u2019s about unity in progress.\n\nRead more about inclusion\u2026\n\nDemographics\n\nIndia, a land of unparalleled diversity and cultural richness, is equally fascinating when it comes to its demographics.\n\nDemographics, the study of a population\u2019s composition, characteristics, and trends, unveils a vivid tapestry of people, languages, religions, and aspirations. In this post, we\u2019ll journey through India\u2019s demographics, exploring its unique features and the transformative shifts that shape its future.\n\nPopulation Diversity: Unity in Multiplicity\n\nIndia\u2019s population is a melting pot of various ethnicities, languages, religions, and traditions. With over 1.3 billion people, it\u2019s the world\u2019s second-most populous country. The term \u201cunity in diversity\u201d is exemplified in India\u2019s demographics, where a multitude of identities coexist harmoniously.\n\nLANGUAGES AND LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY\n\nIndia is a linguistic wonderland, with an estimated 22 officially recognized languages and thousands of dialects. Hindi, in its various forms, serves as a link between different regions, but states also embrace their native languages with pride. Each language is a window into unique cultures, traditions, and ways of life.\n\nRELIGIOUS PLURALITY\n\nReligious diversity is a defining aspect of India\u2019s demographics. Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, and various other faiths are practised here. The nation\u2019s commitment to secularism is a testament to its respect for all religions, fostering a harmonious coexistence.\n\nDemographic Transitions: A Changing Landscape\n\nIndia\u2019s demographics are in a constant state of flux due to various factors, including birth rates, death rates, and migration. Over the years, the country has undergone significant demographic transitions that have far-reaching implications.\n\nYOUTHFUL POPULATION\n\nOne striking feature is India\u2019s youthfulness. The median age is around 28 years, making it one of the youngest nations globally. This \u201cyouth bulge\u201d offers immense potential for the workforce, innovation, and economic growth.\n\nURBANIZATION AND MIGRATION\n\nUrbanization is reshaping India\u2019s demographic landscape. People from rural areas are moving to cities in search of better opportunities, resulting in the growth of urban centers. This migration brings cultural exchange, increased demand for infrastructure, and challenges related to housing and services.\n\nDemographics and Development\n\nUnderstanding demographics is crucial for policymaking and development strategies. By analyzing the age distribution, literacy rates, and income levels, authorities can tailor interventions to meet specific needs.\n\nHEALTHCARE AND AGING\n\nIndia\u2019s demographics also hold insights into healthcare requirements. As the population ages, healthcare systems must adapt to address age-related ailments and ensure a healthy elderly population.\n\nEDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT\n\nThe youth-dominated demographic structure calls for investment in education and skill development. Empowering the youth with quality education and job opportunities is a key step toward reaping the demographic dividend.\n\nIndia\u2019s demographics are a vibrant mosaic that reflects its cultural richness, historical legacy, and evolving aspirations. It\u2019s a story of unity within diversity, where countless identities coalesce into a shared destiny. As India navigates its demographic transitions, understanding and harnessing this diversity will be critical for shaping a future that benefits all citizens, preserves traditions, and embraces progress.\n\nRead more about India\u2019s demographics\u2026\n\nSocial Sector Initiatives\n\nIndia has implemented a range of major social sector initiatives to address various challenges and improve the well-being of its citizens.

PPIs are an integral part of India\u2019s journey towards cashless transactions in the country. It\u2019s important to advance the digital economy of the nation as well. Read here to learn more about PPIs.\n\nThe RBI has been steadfastly trying to establish a digital payment system environment to attain a less cash-efficient economy ever since the enactment of the Payment and Settlement System Act in 2007.\n\nAlthough traditional bank products like debit cards, credit cards, and net banking have not been ignored in this process, the RBI has made a significant effort to promote prepaid payment instruments (PPI).\n\nPPI is a relatively newer category of payment instruments that are already well-accepted in many developed nations like the United States and Europe.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPrepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs)\nTypes of Prepaid Payment Instruments\nClosed system\nSemi-closed system\nOpen system\nWho can issue PPIs?\nAdvantages of Prepaid Payment Instruments\nDrawbacks\nRecent news on PPIs\nConclusion\nPrepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs)\n\nPrepaid payment instruments, often known as prepaid cards or stored value cards, were first produced as paper gift cards or certificates in the USA in the 1970s.\n\nThe US telecom sector later used single-purpose (or closed loop/system) prepaid cards that were exclusively valid at a particular merchant location in the 1980s.\nLarge retail chains came after them in the early 1990s.\nBut up to that point, there were no indications of any prepaid cards with multiple uses.\n\nPrepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs), sometimes referred to as prepaid cards or stored value cards in several nations, are specific tools that make it easier to buy products and services using the money they have on hand.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe value kept in these instruments is the cash, a debit from the holder\u2019s bank account (via a debit card or net banking), or any credit card used to make the purchase.\nPPIs can come in the form of payment wallets, smart cards, magnetic chips, vouchers, mobile wallets, etc. Any instrument that can be used to access a prepaid amount is a PPI.\n\nRBI as per the guidelines provided under the Payment and Settlement Act, 2005 defined Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) as instruments of payment that facilitate buying of goods and services, including the transfer of funds, financial services,s and remittances, against the value stored within or on the instrument.\n\nCash loading of PPIs is limited to Rs 50,000 per month.\nOnly those companies incorporated in India and have a minimum paid-up capital of Rs. 5 crore and minimum positive net worth of Rs. 1 crore are permitted to issue PPIs in India.\nTypes of Prepaid Payment Instruments\n\nAccording to the RBI, PPIs in the country can be issued under three systems. They are as follows:\n\nClosed system\n\nThe closed system is one in which a PPI is only valid when used for purchases made by the company that issued it in the first place.\n\nWhen a person tries to purchase goods or services from a different supplier, the usage of such a PPI will be invalid.\nAdditionally, this approach does not permit cash withdrawals about the PPI balance.\nThe issue of such PPIs does not require previous RBI permission since the RBI has not categorized this PPI system as a payment system.\nExamples of a closed system PPI are paper vouchers or gift vouchers and coupons; it also will include smart cards that can only be used in the establishments that issue them such as metro railcards and chips.\nSemi-closed system\n\nPPIs issued under the semi-closed system, as opposed to PPIs issued under the closed system, can be used at certain but not all institutions.\n\nUnder this structure, the RBI may only license non-banking entities or banking institutions to issue PPIs.\nWithout prior clearance or authorization from the RBI, PPIs cannot be issued.\nThey can be used for purchases, remittance services, and other transactions at a variety of clearly specified retailers, either by location or at particular businesses that have agreements with the PPIs\u2019 issuers to accept them as payment.\nSuch a contract does not have to be made directly between the issuer and the business taking PPI as a form of payment; it may instead be made through a payment aggregator or payment gateway.\nPPIs issued under the semi-closed system are not permitted to assist cash withdrawals, much like PPIs issued under the closed system. Whether a bank issued the PPI or not makes no difference.\n\nThere are further types of semi-closed PPIs:\n\nMinimum detail PPI is the type in that only the bare minimum details of the holder of the PPI are obtained. The maximum amount of money that may be loaded on the PPI is up to Rs 10,000.\nLoading only from a bank account where the PPI can only be loaded via the bank account and not through any other means such as cash etc.\nFull KYC PPI where full KYC of the PPI holder has been obtained and registered by the PPI issuer and the maximum limit of money that can be loaded onto the instrument increases to Rs 1 lakh.\nOpen system\n\nUnder this approach, only financial institutions that have received RBI approval may offer PPIs.\n\nThese tools may be used to make purchases, remit money, withdraw cash, etc. easier.\nDebit cards and credit cards are two instances of PPIs issued under this scheme.\nWho can issue PPIs?\n\nPPIs can be issued by banks and non-banks after obtaining approval from the RBI.\n\nThe following criteria must be satisfied by non-banking organizations, such as businesses, for them to be qualified to issue PPIs:\n\nThe business must be set up in India.\nThe company\u2019s minimum paid-up capital must be greater than Rs 5 crore.\nThere must always be a minimum of Rs 1 crore in positive net worth.\n\nAny financial institution that satisfies the eligibility requirements stipulated by the RBI is permitted to issue PPIs.\n\nBut only banks with the RBI\u2019s approval may introduce mobile-based PPIs when it comes to offering mobile banking transactions.\n\nNon-Banking Financial Institutions and other businesses are only permitted to issue PPIs in a closed or semi-closed system.\n\nMobile-based PPIs are included in this. The sole prerequisite for non-banking businesses to issue PPIs is that they must keep an escrow account with any designated commercial banks in the nation.\nAdvantages of Prepaid Payment Instruments\nPrepaid payment instruments are often supplied with the barest minimum of requirements.\nThese tools may be utilized effortlessly at merchant sites and come in the form of tangible coupons or plastic cards (like debit or credit cards).\nIt saves time at public spaces like metro ticket counters and grocery marts with quick payments.\nIt substitutes the need for physical cash.\nPrepaid travel cards which are some open system payment instruments are immensely helpful in case of cross-border travel as these are generally issued by international card companies in association with banks.\nDrawbacks\nA prepaid payment instrument is not a debit card and hence not linked to any bank account. As a result, the balance stored in it does not attract any interest.\nAs with any digital system, PPIs are also susceptible to hacking and related security threats.\nRecent news on PPIs\n\nAn RBI-appointed committee has recommended that RBI should examine the extension of Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) cover to Prepaid\u00a0Payment Instruments. Presently, it is available only for bank deposits.\n\nDICGC is an RBI subsidiary, that provides deposit insurance coverage to various types of deposits, including savings, fixed, current, recurring, and accrued interest.\nThe limit of insurance is up to a maximum of Rs 5 lakh for both principal and interest amounts held by them.\nCovers commercial banks i.e., local area banks, payments banks, small finance banks, regional rural banks, and cooperative banks.\nConclusion\n\nDemonetization has unexpectedly given all digital channels of commerce an impetus. Even after re-monetization, these instruments, and more especially PPIs (mostly semi-closed m-wallets), have continued to expand, which strongly shows that the Indian public is coming to embrace these payment methods.\n\nThis is because a variety of variables, such as various types of prepaid payment instruments, are speeding up the expanding acceptance of digital forms of transactions.\n\nTo create India a more cashless, digital economy, the government is acting very aggressively. A speedier adoption of all digital payment methods, including PPIs, has been made possible by the introduction of new instruments and the easing of current regulations.\n\nSecurity, however, appears to be a major concern for quality transactions.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Like with any stock investment, foreign portfolio investors often expect to see a return on their funds very quickly.\nBecause securities are frequently traded, the liquidity of portfolio assets makes them easier to sell than direct investments.\nPortfolio investments are far more accessible to the average investor since they need substantially less investment capital and due diligence than direct investments.\n\nFPI is part of a country\u2019s capital account and is shown on its Balance of Payments (BOP).\n\nIn India, foreign portfolio investment is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).\n\nFPI in India refers to investment groups or FIIs (foreign institutional investors) and QFIs (qualified foreign investors).\nSEBI has introduced the Foreign Portfolio Investors Regulations, 2019.\nFPIs also need to follow the Income-tax Act, of 1961 and the Foreign Exchange Management Act, of 1999.\n\nOne can register FPI in one of the below categories:\n\nCategory I (low risk): This includes investors from the Government sector. Such as central banks, Governmental agencies, and international or multilateral organizations or agencies.\n\nCategory II (moderate risk): Regulated broad-based funds such as mutual funds, investment trusts, and insurance/reinsurance companies. It also includes regulated banks, asset management companies, portfolio managers, investment advisors, and managers.\n\nCategory III (high risk): It includes those who are not eligible in the first two categories. It includes endowments, charitable societies, charitable trusts, foundations, corporate bodies, trusts, and individuals.\n\nAn individual must fulfill the following conditions to register as FPI:\n\nAs per the Income-tax Act 1961, the applicant should not be a non-resident Indian\nShould not be a citizen of a country that falls under the public statement of FATF.\nMust be eligible to invest in securities outside the country.\nTo invest in securities, he/she must have the approval of the MOA / AOA / Agreement.\nA certificate that grants the applicant holds an interest in the development of the securities market.\nIn case the bank is the applicant, it must belong to a nation whose central bank is a member of the Bank for International Settlements.\nFactors and Risks Related to FPI\n\nHere are some factors affecting Foreign Portfolio Investment:\n\nFuture Prospects: A nation\u2019s economy is key to attracting international investment. Investors are more likely to invest in a nation\u2019s financial assets if its economy is strong and expanding. Investors, on the other hand, tend to sell their investments if the nation experiences financial instability or a recession.\nRates of Interest: A high return on investment is what investors seek. As a result, investors like investing in nations with high-interest rates.\nRates of Tax: Capital gains are subject to taxation. The return on investment is decreased by higher tax rates. As a result, investors like investing in nations with lower tax rates.\n\nForeign Portfolio Investments have some risks associated with them \u2013 for both the investors and the destination country. Here are a few risks involved in it:\n\nExposure to Political Risk: Political risk might arise as a result of the altered political climate. As a result, economic policies, repatriation laws, and investment requirements all alter.\nLiquidity is low: Because of the frequently low levels of capital market liquidity in emerging nations, price volatility is generally higher.\nBenefits of Foreign Portfolio Investment\nForeign portfolio investments increase investor demand for a company\u2019s shares and aid in their ability to raise funds efficiently.\nThe secondary market\u2019s depth would significantly increase with the existence of FPI.\nFrom the standpoint of the investor, it enables them to diversify their holdings and gain from that diversification.\nChanges in currency rates might be advantageous to investors as well.\nInternational markets provide investors access to a larger market that is occasionally less competitive than their local market. This indicates that companies profit from less competition elsewhere.\nThe fact that FPI is liquid ensures that the investor is empowered and can act quickly when there are attractive opportunities.\nDifference between FPI and FDI\nWhen a direct commercial interest is developed abroad, the term Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is used. This commercial interest may, for instance, be a manufacturing or storage facility.\nAn FDI includes the formation of a joint venture or a subsidiary and may result in the transfer of resources, knowledge, and money.\nFDI is larger and more long-term than foreign portfolio investment.\nInstitutions or venture capital firms invest in FDI. FPI just makes investments in the assets or securities of another nation.\nFPI entails purchasing shares or bonds that are made available on the exchange of the foreign nation. Since FPI is liquid, buying and selling it is simple.\nPassive investors are involved in FPI, whereas active investors are the focus of FDI. When compared to FDI, FPI is a less long-term kind of investment because it is not a direct investment.\nNew SEBI Proposal\n\nSEBI has identified several issues with FPIs:\n\nConcern over promoters of such corporate groupings or other investors working in concert is raised by concentrated investments made by some FPIs. These investors may be exploiting the FPI approach to get around regulatory constraints.\nAn entity of a nation having a land border with India may invest exclusively via the Government Route, although this restriction can be avoided by using the FPI route.\n\nSEBI\u2019s new proposal includes:\n\nFPIs may be further categorized as Low (Government and related entities), Moderate (Pension Funds or Public Retail Funds), and High Risk (All other FPIs).\nEnhanced transparency measures for fully identifying all holders of ownership, economic, and control rights may be mandated for certain objectively identified high-risk FPIs.\nFPIs with an exposure of more than 50% to a single group or with assets of over Rs 25,000 crore will be tagged as \u2018high risk\u2019 and will be required to provide additional information.\nDisclosures by FPIs must be unconstrained by any thresholds set by PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering) rules and FPI regulations.\n\nAlso read: Masala Bonds: Concept Explained With Video\n\nWay forward\n\nInvestors that want to diversify their portfolios by investments in shares, bonds, mutual funds, or other assets or securities located abroad make international portfolio investments.\n\nFPIs are often higher in developing nations with large development potential. FPI is crucial since it fuels the stock markets and increases the liquidity of the host nation\u2019s capital markets.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish",

They provided intentionally low LIBOR rates to maintain the rates at the traders\u2019 desired levels.\nThe purpose of the alleged wrongdoing was to increase the earnings of traders who had positions in financial securities dependent on LIBOR.\n\nBecause of doubts about LIBOR\u2019s dependability and integrity, the RBI is also abandoning it.\n\nThe LIBOR mechanism\u2019s main weakness is that it heavily relies on banks to disclose their borrowing rates honestly and accurately, disregarding their economic interests. Misconduct and manipulation are made possible by this.\nSome banks purposefully reduced their LIBOR filings during the 2008 financial crisis to provide a more favorable picture.

These rates are derived, among other places, from the Bloomberg Index Services.\n\nTo lower the risks associated with LIBOR, SOFR, and MMIFOR were introduced to provide a more trustworthy and transaction-based benchmark for financial contracts.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe switch from LIBOR to an Alternate Reference Rate is difficult in terms of technological and regulatory considerations.\n\nThese difficulties included dealing with already-written contracts and modifying them as needed with counterparties, interbank organizations, and borrowers.\nEssential systemic and technological reforms must be made by banks. These adjustments entail figuring out the total exposure and identifying goods linked to LIBOR.\nCustomers must also be informed about the transition, backup provisions must be added to contracts to cover situations where the reference rate is unavailable, the impact on profit and loss statements must be evaluated, and required changes must be made to technological systems.\n\nAlso read: Monetary Policy of India \u2013 Everything You Should Know About\n\nWay forward\n\nThe interest rates on short-term loans made between banks were represented by the London Interbank Offered Rate, a benchmark used around the world.\n\nBut in 2012, when certain bankers were found to be manipulating the index for their gain, the index came under scrutiny.\n\nMost countries have since phased out LIBOR and many have proposed their regional variants.\n\nFor instance, Europe has the European Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Japan has the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR), China has Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR), and India has the Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate (MIBOR).\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Read here to learn about the history of banking in India.\n\nA nation\u2019s financial system supports its economic growth. The banking industry in India has seen significant changes during the past five centuries due to the state of the economy, the need for financial services, and the subsequent advances in technology.\n\nIt appears from historical accounts from Greece, Rome, Egypt, and Babylon that temples did more than just save money; they also lent it out. One reason temples were often looted during conflicts was that they frequently served as the financial hubs of their towns.\n\nSince the first coins were produced and wealthy individuals realized they required a secure location to put their money, banking has existed.

It was liquidated in 1830-32.\nIn 1786 General Bank of India was set up but it failed in 1791.\n\nCalcutta developed as a banking hub since it was India\u2019s busiest port for trade, mostly because of the British Empire\u2019s trade.\n\nThe British East India Company granted the Bank of Calcutta, Bank of Bombay, and Bank of Madras licenses to establish the three Presidency banks. For long years, they operated in India as if they were central banks.\nThe Bank of Calcutta established in 1806 immediately became the Bank of Bengal.\nThese three banks joined in 1921 to become the Imperial Bank of India.\nLater, in 1955, the Imperial Bank of India was nationalized in 1955 and was named The State Bank of India, which is currently the largest Public sector Bank.\nBefore the Reserve Bank of India was founded in 1935 under the Reserve Bank of India Act, of 1934, the presidency banks and their successors served as quasi-central banks for a long time.\nConsequently, the State Bank of India is the country\u2019s oldest bank.\n\nDuring this time, as many as 600 banks were founded.\n\nMany large banks were unable to function because of a lack of management expertise, equipment, and technology, which resulted in laborious procedures and mistakes made by humans, making Indian account holders vulnerable to fraud.\n\nA few banks have endured and are still around today like the Allahabad Bank (1865), Punjab National Bank (1894), etc.\n\nAs a result of the Swadeshi movement, various local merchants and politicians set up banks for the Indian population between 1906 and 1911. Numerous of these are still in use.\n\nThe financial sector saw rough periods from the First World War (1914\u20131918), till the conclusion of the Second World War (1939\u201345), and two years later, until India gained its independence. Many banks failed as a result of these chaotic times.\n\nHistory of Banking in India: Post-independence phase (1947-1991)\n\nThe Government of India (GOI) chose the strategy of a mixed economy with considerable market involvement in 1948 to develop the economy, continuing the evolution of the Indian banking sector post-independence.\n\nAfter being established in 1935, the Reserve Bank of India was nationalized in 1949 and given the authority to oversee, govern, and inspect all banks in India.\n\nAll of India\u2019s main banks were privately run at the time of independence, which raised concerns because rural residents were still reliant on moneylenders for financial support.\n\nThe then-Government chose to nationalize the banks to address this issue.\n\nAlso read: Unified Payment Interface (UPI): Made Simple\n\nNationalization of banks\n\nThe Government of India issued the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Ordinance in 1969 and nationalized the 14 largest commercial banks in India at that time.\n\nAllahabad Bank\nBank of India\nBank of Baroda\nBank of Maharashtra\nCentral Bank of India\nCanara Bank\nDena Bank\nIndian Overseas Bank\nIndian Bank\nPunjab National Bank\nSyndicate Bank\nUnion Bank of India\nUnited Bank\nUCO Bank\n\nIn 1959, 7 subsidiaries of SBI were nationalized:\n\nState Bank of Patiala\nState Bank of Hyderabad\nState Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur\nState Bank of Mysore\nState Bank of Travancore\nState Bank of Saurashtra\nState Bank of Indore\n\nIn the year 1980, another 6 banks were nationalized, taking the number to 20 banks:\n\nAndhra Bank\nCorporation Bank\nNew Bank of India\nOriental Bank of Comm.\nPunjab & Sind Bank\nVijaya Bank\nPost-nationalization\n\nIn India, nationalizing banks marked a turning point toward financial stability, particularly in rural areas where there were no big banks. The efficiency of the financial sector in India was enhanced by the nationalised banks.\n\nThe step has a huge impact on the financial system of the country-\n\nWhen branches were established in the farthest reaches of the nation, bank access improved.\nSince more people had access to banks as a result of the opening of new branches, the average domestic saving increased by two times.\nA comparable rise in public deposits resulted from the expansion of banks\u2019 reach, which aided the expansion of export-related sectors, agriculture, and small businesses.\nImproved effectiveness and more public confidence were the results of greater accountability.\nThe economy expanded significantly as a result of the small-scale industries\u2019 boost.\nAfter being nationalised, RBI had already established a precedent by ranking among the biggest employers. As more banks followed the lead, this continued.\nBanks provide financing to marginal farmers at reasonable rates, which significantly boosted India\u2019s agricultural industry.\nLiberalization (1991)\n\nTo increase the involvement of private and foreign investors, the Government implemented economic liberalization in 1991, which resulted in a significant change in its economic policies.\n\nRead the following articles for a better understanding of liberalization:\n\nEconomic Reforms of 1991\nEffects of Liberalization on the Indian Economy\nConclusion\n\nThe history of banking in India has gone through numerous changes and is of the most mature financial systems.\n\nEven though the reach of banks has spread to rural areas also, the financial inclusion of the poor remains a challenge. Many initiatives like NABARD are being implemented to rectify this issue.\n\nIndian banking is walking hand in hand with technological advancement as well.\n\nThe National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and the Government of India together unveiled the UPI (Unified Payment Interface) System and BHIM in 2016, ushering in the era of digital payments and what is commonly referred to as mobile banking.\nFollowing technological developments, several fintech in the nation has advanced digital banking in collaboration with conventional banks to offer a wide range of financial services.\nFull-stack \u201cdigital banks,\u201d which will solely rely on the Internet to provide their services and not on their physical branches, were planned to be established by Niti Aayog in 2021.\nDigital banking in India is anticipated to undergo a revolution as a result.\n\nAlso read: Indian Financial System\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Space infrastructure furthermore contributes to monitoring the emission of greenhouse gases.\n\nCOVID-19 has highlighted the importance of digital connectivity for both economic development and social well-being. Despite considerable progress in the last decade, hundreds of millions of people in both high and lower-income countries still have no access to a fast and reliable fixed Internet connection.\n\nSatellite-based broadband is one of the technologies that could bring connectivity to areas where other terrestrial alternatives are not available or too expensive to deploy, and new services are underway.\n\nSpace technologies are increasingly used also for development assistance purposes. Space-related official development assistance (ODA) includes technical assistance in telemedicine, geographic information systems, etc\n\nSpace-related ODA projects support a range of different objectives, such as monitoring the environment and natural resources, improving food safety, supporting government services, or developing economic infrastructures.\n\nThe space sector has evolved and spread with astonishing speed in the last two decades, but challenges remain to realize the full benefits of public space investments. While some of these challenges can be addressed by space organizations themselves, more often they rely on close coordination and cooperation with other government services.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

What are the problems associated with it? Read further to know.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India has released a discussion paper proposing the use of the expected credit loss (ECL) method for making provisions on bad loans, which could lead to increased capital requirements for banks, according to analysts.\n\nThe proposed approach would require banks to assess the likelihood of default at the outset and make provisions accordingly, in contrast to the current method of making provisions after a loan has defaulted.\n\nAs per the RBI, the increase in provisioning requirement on common equity tier-I (CET1) capital for loan loss, which will be incurred by scheduled commercial banks due to the transition to the expected credit loss (ECL) model, will be phased out in five years.\n\nThe proposed ECL approach is used in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 that has prescribed guidelines for loss provisioning by banks.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are the Loan Loss Provisions?\nFramework for Loan Loss Provisions\nStage 1\nStage 2\nStage 3\nBenefits of Loan Loss Provision Approach\nProblems Associated With This Approach\nConclusion\nWhat are the Loan Loss Provisions?\n\nThe RBI said that banks would be allowed to design and implement their own models for measuring ECL for the purpose of estimating loss provisions in line with the proposed principles.\n\nTo cover the losses partially or entirely, banks reserve a proportion of anticipated loan repayments from all the loans in their portfolio. In case of a loss, banks can use their loan loss reserves to cover it, rather than incurring a loss in their cash flows.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSince not all loans are expected to become impaired, loan loss reserves usually have enough funds to cover the loss for any one or a few loans when needed.\n\nIn short, an increase in the balance of reserves is known as a loan loss provision. The level of loan loss provision is established to ensure the safety and soundness of the bank, based on the expected level.\n\nAs per the proposal, Regional rural banks and smaller cooperative banks (based on a threshold) will be kept out of the above framework.\n\nFramework for Loan Loss Provisions\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India has proposed a new framework for loan loss provisioning that requires banks to estimate expected credit losses based on forward-looking estimations. This shift moves away from the current method where loss provisions are made after a default.\n\nUnder the proposed framework, banks must classify financial assets into one of three categories: Stage 1, Stage 2, or Stage 3, depending on the assessed credit losses at the time of initial recognition and on each subsequent reporting date.\n\nStage 1\n\nStage 1 assets have low credit risk or have not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. For these assets, 12-month expected credit losses are recognized, and interest revenue is calculated on the gross carrying amount of the asset.\n\nStage 2\n\nStage 2 assets have had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but there is no objective evidence of impairment. Lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for these assets, but interest revenue is still calculated on the gross carrying amount of the asset.\n\nStage 3\n\nStage 3 assets have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date. Lifetime expected credit loss is recognized for these assets, and interest revenue is calculated on the net carrying amount.\n\nBenefits of Loan Loss Provision Approach\n\nSignificant benefits of this approach are:\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stated in a discussion paper that the forward-looking expected credit losses approach is likely to enhance the banking system\u2019s resilience, which is in line with globally accepted norms.\nThe expected credit losses approach involves banks estimating the credit losses they may incur in the future based on forward-looking estimations.\nThis approach is an improvement over the incurred loss approach, where banks wait for credit losses to occur before making corresponding loss provisions.\nAccording to the RBI, the expected credit loss approach is likely to result in excess provisions as compared to the shortfall in provisions seen in the incurred loss approach.\nExcess provisions can help banks absorb potential future losses and maintain financial stability.\nThe RBI\u2019s statement emphasizes the importance of adopting a forward-looking approach to credit losses to enhance the banking system\u2019s resilience.\nProblems Associated With This Approach\n\nThe discussion paper proposing a shift to an expected credit loss (ECL) method for making provisions on bad loans could raise capital requirements significantly for banks, particularly government-owned banks. The probability of default over the last 5-10 years has been high for the banking sector, which could result in higher eventual ECL provisions.\n\nWhile the impact on individual banks is difficult to assess, some large banks with strong specific and contingent buffers could benefit from the ECL-based norms, while small private sector banks may have to accelerate provision buffers and even replenish capital levels faster than planned.\n\nThe model to calculate the expected credit loss is to be decided by individual banks but is subject to independent evaluation and a floor on provisions set by the regulator.\n\nDespite potential challenges, analysts at Emkay Global Research believe that this is an opportune time to introduce ECL norms for banks and strengthen their provision buffers before the next asset-quality shock.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s proposal to shift towards the expected credit loss (ECL) method for loan loss provisioning is a positive step towards enhancing the resilience of the banking system. By making provisions for potential future losses, banks can maintain excess provisions, which can help absorb any future losses and maintain financial stability.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how effectively banks will be able to design and implement their own ECL models and comply with the proposed framework. Nonetheless, the RBI\u2019s emphasis on adopting a forward-looking approach to credit losses is a step in the right direction toward ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking system.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

The Signature bank also suffered the same fate. The bank run was caused by the collapse, which was brought on by the constant rise in interest rates.\n\nA bank run happens when many individuals withdraw their money from a bank or another financial institution at once out of concern that it could go out of business.\n\nIn 1933, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was created in response to a bank run that occurred during the Great Depression.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a bank run?\nCauses of a bank run\nPrevention and mitigation\nHistory of bank runs\nMeasures by RBI for bank stability\nConclusion\nWhat is a bank run?\n\nWhen several clients of a bank or other financial institution simultaneously withdraw their savings out of worry for the bank\u2019s stability, this is known as a bank run.\n\nThe likelihood of default rises as more individuals withdraw their money, which encourages additional people to do the same.

Customers are compelled to act right away without even confirming the news.\nA bank that practices fractional reserve banking only keeps a percentage of the deposits made on the property. As a result, when several customers take their money at once, they forfeit the actual cash on hand. It causes a severe cash crisis, which forces the bank into bankruptcy.\nLosses on selling assets at lower prices can cause a bank to become insolvent. A bank panic occurs when multiple banks endure runs at the same time.\n\nWhen multiple banks confront the same situation simultaneously, bank panic ensues, resulting in an economic recession, economic instability, and a systemic banking crisis.\n\nPrevention and mitigation\n\nSome of the common practices adopted by banks and financial institutions to prevent bank runs are as follows:\n\nSelling assets to increase cash availability inside the facility\nImposing withdrawal limitations or prohibiting withdrawals entirely\nBorrowing more money from other banks, financial institutions, or the central bank.\nIf banks don\u2019t have enough cash on hand, they can borrow from other organizations. Huge loans could keep them from filing for bankruptcy.\nIn the event that a bank run is imminent, banks may decide to close for a while. This stops individuals from gathering in a line and withdrawing cash.\nPeople\u2019s concern often dissipates when they learn that the government insures their deposits.\nDeposit insurance is one such safety valve through which the losses of the so-called \u201cunsophisticated\u201d depositors of banks can be plugged, albeit to a stipulated limit, in case banks fail, and thereby help arrest the cataclysmic impact of bank runs.\n\nThe government may step in to prevent banks from defaulting in various ways, such as:\n\nSetting higher cash reserve requirements\nBailing out of banks\nImplementing oversight and regulation\nIntroducing deposit insurance schemes\nHistory of bank runs\n\nBank runs date back to the early days of banking when European goldsmiths in the 15th and 16th centuries would issue paper receipts payable for actual gold in excess of the stock they had.\n\nThis was a pioneering instance of fractional reserve banking, in which banks could print more paper money redeemable for gold than they really had on hand.\n\nThe Great Depression is frequently linked in contemporary history with bank runs.\n\nAmerican depositors started to fear after the 1929 stock market disaster and turned to storing actual cash for safety. In 1930, Tennessee had the first bank failure brought on by large-scale withdrawals.\n\nBank runs were a prominent response to the financial crisis of 2008\u20132009.\n\nThe sixth-largest financial institution in the United States at the time, Washington Mutual (WaMu), was shut down on September 25, 2008.\n\nIn 2022, the sanctions against Russia during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT system led to a banking panic across multiple Russian banks\n\nMeasures by RBI for bank stability\n\nRBI takes a series of actions to ensure the stability of banks in case of emergencies:\n\nReporting entails making reports, such as the Financial Stability Report, available to the public twice a year to lessen the likelihood of speculation and, consequently, bank runs.\nConsumers trust in the nation\u2019s monetary situation is also increased by initiatives like making the minutes of monetary policy committee meetings available to the public.\nUsing important reserve ratios to exercise control, such as CRR (Cash maintained separately with the RBI) and SLR (Cash, Gold or G-Secs kept with the banks).\nThey make sure that there is enough liquidity in the banks to fulfill the escalating demand.\nRestructuring assets to increase equity also increases bank capital and, as a result, improves Basel-III standards CAR values compliance.\nConclusion\n\nBank runs can bring down banks and trigger further systemic financial crises because they produce negative feedback loops.\n\nDue to the fact that a bank may only have 10% of the cash represented by all deposits on hand, if, say, 20% of customers want their money back, the bank will not have enough cash on hand to reimburse its depositors.\n\nBut, if the withdrawals were spaced out across time and at a slower rate, the bank might be able to find the money.\n\nWhile several regulatory mechanisms are now in place to mitigate bank runs, silent bank runs mediated by electronic transfers can make a run on the bank still possible.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Most analysts as a practical definition of recession, define it as two consecutive quarters of decline in a country\u2019s real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all goods and services a country produces.\n\nAlthough this definition is a useful rule of thumb, it has drawbacks.\n\nA focus on GDP alone is narrow, and it is often better to consider a wider set of measures of economic activity to determine whether a country is indeed suffering a recession.\nUsing other indicators can also provide a timelier gauge of the state of the economy.\n\nIn simpler terms, a recession is a significant, pervasive, and persistent decline in economic activity.\n\nThe length of a recession is calculated by counting from the top of the previous expansion to its bottom.\nAlthough a few months might pass between recessions, it can take years for the economy to reach its previous high.\nDespite some forecasted recessions not occurring, an inverted yield curve has correctly predicted each of the last ten recessions.\nMany people may perceive the early phases of a comeback as a continuing recession since unemployment frequently persists at high levels far into an economic recovery.\nTo reduce the dangers of a recession, countries adopt fiscal and monetary measures.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a private research organization, which maintains a chronology of the beginning and ending dates of U.S. recessions, uses a broader definition and considers several measures of activity to decide the dates of recessions.\n\nBecause the United States is one of the world\u2019s largest economies and has strong trade and financial linkages with many other economies, most of these globally synchronized recession episodes also coincide with U.S. recessions.\n\nAn inverted yield curve has been viewed as an indicator of a pending economic recession.\n\nYield curve\nCourtesy: Britannica\n\nThe link between the short- and long-term interest rates of fixed-income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury is known as the yield curve.\n\nWhen short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates, the yield curve is inverted.\nIn normal conditions, the yield curve is not inverted as loans with longer maturities normally carry higher interest rates than nearer-term ones.\nAs inverted yield curves are unique and longer-term debt should be riskier and have higher interest rates, they have effects on both investors and consumers.\nOne of the best predictors of an upcoming recession is an inverted Treasury yield curve.\n\nThe curves can be flat or steep depending on the money available in the market and the expected overall economic activity.\n\nTypically, short-term interest rates are lower than long-term rates, so the yield curve slopes upwards, reflecting higher yields for longer-term investments. This is referred to as a normal yield curve.\nWhen the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates narrows, the yield curve begins to flatten. A flat yield curve is often seen during the transition from a normal yield curve to an inverted one.\nWhy do economic recessions happen?\n\nUnderstanding the sources of recessions has been one of the enduring areas of research in economics. There are a variety of reasons recessions take place.\n\nSharp changes in the prices of the inputs used in producing goods and services.\nA recession can also be triggered by a country\u2019s decision to reduce inflation by employing contractionary monetary or fiscal policies.\nSome recessions are rooted in financial market problems. Sharp increases in asset prices and a speedy expansion of credit often coincide with the rapid accumulation of debt.\nIt can be the result of a decline in external demand, especially in countries with strong export sectors.\nA recession is an economic downturn that is not caused solely by the economic activity itself. Technological developments are also a factor in the recession.\nThe imbalance between production and consumption can also trigger a recession.\nAnother indication is when the value of a country\u2019s imports is greater than its exports. This can affect the state budget deficit and a decrease in national income.\n\nBecause recessions have many potential causes, it is a challenge to predict them.\n\nThe behavioral patterns of numerous economic variables including credit volume, asset prices, and the unemployment rate around recessions have been documented.\n\nBut although they might be the cause of recessions, they could also be the result of recessions or in economic parlance, endogenous to recessions.\nEven though economists use a large set of variables to forecast the future behavior of economic activity, none has proven a reliable predictor of whether a recession is going to take place.\nCharacteristics of recession\n\nAlthough each recession has unique features, recessions often exhibit several common characteristics:\n\nThey typically last about a year and often result in a significant output cost. In particular, a recession is usually associated with a decline of 2 percent in GDP. In the case of severe recessions, the typical output cost is close to 5 percent.\nThe fall in consumption is often small, but both industrial production and investment register much larger declines than that in GDP.\nThey typically overlap with drops in international trade as exports and, especially, imports fall sharply during periods of slowdown.\nThe unemployment rate almost always jumps and inflation falls slightly because overall demand for goods and services is curtailed.\nAlong with the erosion of house and equity values, recessions tend to be associated with turmoil in financial markets.\nTypes of economic recession\n\nThere can be several factors causing recession and concerning them and the recoveries, recession can be classified into four or five basic types:\n\nBoom and bust recession\n\nMost economies bounce up and down while their overall growth increases.\n\nAn economy that \u201cbooms,\u201d or expands faster than planned over the long term, frequently face inflation.\n\nA central bank or other government supervisory body frequently implements measures to \u201ccool\u201d the economy and avoid overheating to manage inflation.\n\nOften, these measures involve boosting taxes, decreasing government expenditure, or increasing interest rates.\nThis might limit general spending and shift consumer preferences to conserving money and paying off debts, which can produce a recession, or \u201cbust.\nBalance sheet recession\n\nRichard Koo, an economist, coined the phrase \u201cbalance sheet recession,\u201d which often occurs when an economy is overextended with debt.\n\nIn typical times, financial institutions lend out the money that people and corporations save with them to other people and companies, keeping the economy moving.\nAs consumer and company spending patterns change as a result of worries about debt levels, everyone starts to cut down on spending at the same time to \u201cclean up their balance sheets.\u201d\nDepression\n\nThere is no formal definition of depression, but most analysts consider depression to be an extremely severe recession in which the decline in GDP exceeds 10 percent.\n\nThere have been only a handful of depression episodes in advanced economies since 1960.\n\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, policies like the New Deal restructured how the economy functioned and many regulations from that time are still in use today.\nSupply-side shock\n\nGlobal events, like wars, natural disasters, or public health crises, can cause a large shock to domestic or international supply chains and push an economy into a recession.\n\nThese sorts of recessions may not continue long if the supply is replenished soon.\nYet if not, the impacts of the supply shock might last for years, as is the case with the ongoing supply problems brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThey can also result in a long-term movement towards supply chain diversification or changing how products are utilized, such as an increase in investments in alternative fuels like natural gas or solar energy as a result of an oil crisis.\n\nRead here: Economic recoveries\n\nImpact of the economic recession 2023 on the world\n\nThe economic outlook for 2023 will feel different depending on where you are in the world, according to the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe majority of chief economists expect moderate or strong growth in the Middle East and North Africa and South Asia.\nWhile most of them predict that the growth will be weak in the US and Europe.\n\nIn the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) predictions, the outlook for global growth was trimmed by 0.2 percentage points, while the forecast for the eurozone was revised down dramatically to 0.5% from 1.2%.\n\nOn the other side, the Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia were seen as the strongest performers.\n\nSome economies in that region, including Bangladesh and India, were seen as benefiting from a global trend diversifying away from China.\n\nWhile the outlook is generally gloomy and uncertain, potential bright spots include the easing of inflationary pressures and the possibility for consumer sentiment to stabilize and improve.\n\nSoaring food costs will disproportionately affect low-income countries, with many more people facing food insecurity.\nWeak global demand was seen as the biggest challenge for businesses to overcome in 2023, followed by the high cost of borrowing, high input costs, and talent shortages.\nThe fall of the cryptocurrency sector is expected to have relatively little spillover into wider financial markets.\nThe majority of chief economists do not expect further economic disruption from COVID-19.\nConclusion\n\nThe shape, length, and subsequent recoveries of recessions can be influenced by a wide range of various factors. These factors might include supply or economic shocks, natural disasters, or public health emergencies.\n\nA firm or nation may better prepare for a specific recession by understanding the similarities and differences between the many types of recessions and their recoveries.\n\nThese variables may include consumer confidence, interest rates, pricing, and supply chain problems. These insights may help a firm plan for the recovery, whatever shape it takes.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish",

But some economists have expressed doubts over the extent and durability of the economic recovery mainly due to weak demand and investment.\n\nRecently, the Chief economic advisor mentioned that it is wrong to describe India\u2019s urban and rural recovery as a K-shaped recovery.\n\nPost-pandemic, India\u2019s urban and rural areas have seen different growth rates with urban recovery proceeding at a faster pace than rural recovery.\nK-shape recovery denotes a situation of inequality, following a recession, with different parts of the economy recovering at different rates, times, or magnitudes.\nUnder it, some sectors experience growth while others continue to decline. levels.\nThe CEA said that urban recovery is proceeding at a faster pace than rural recovery.\n\nIndia\u2019s economy grew at a weaker-than-expected 4.4 percent in Q3 amid wide revisions to earlier GDP figures, as manufacturing output contracted for the second consecutive quarter and consumer demand slowed.\n\nThe CEA said there was still pent-up demand in the system, as, in the past three years, India had been growing below potential.\n\nShapes of economic recovery\n\nEconomists employ recovery shapes to describe various recessions and the recovery that follows.\n\nThe letters V, U, W, L, and K used to represent the shapes are called by the way each recovery appears on a graph that measures the state of the economy as a whole.\n\nPeople may easily debate and predict the intricacies of an economic slump and how long it could take to recover by using recovery shapes.\n\nV-shaped recovery\nCourtesy: Business Insider\n\nIn a V-shaped recovery, the economy experiences a sharp decline but then bounces back almost immediately to its pre-recession level.\n\nThe period in which the economy remains at a low point (the bottom of the V) is extremely brief.\nThis may happen if the downturn in the economy that triggered it doesn\u2019t continue very long.\nThere can be a seasonal slowdown where firms are holding positions for momentarily unemployed customers.\nPerhaps if quick and innovative fiscal and monetary measures successfully lessen the effects of the recession.\n\nA V-shaped recovery is a best-case scenario, where the economy bounces back immediately bolstered by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nU-shaped recovery\nCourtesy: Business Insider\n\nIn a U-shaped recovery, commonly known as the \u201cNike Swoosh\u201d recovery, the economy undergoes prolonged stagnation following a downward trend.\n\nIt then gradually climbs to its earlier peak. This prolongs the recession, which results in job losses and the depletion of reserves.\n\nIt is less ideal than the V-shaped recovery but much better than the worst-case scenario.\nIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the recession is more severe in terms of the loss in GDP, but it does mean that it lasts longer.\nW-shaped recovery\nCourtesy: Business Insider\n\nA W-shaped recovery, also known as a double-dip recession, occurs when the economy briefly recovers and people believe they will have a V-shaped rebound before the economy declines once more.\n\nAs it is effectively two recessions in one, the first\u2019s effects are prolonged and consumer confidence may be destroyed.\nThe economy might occasionally enter a second recession due to the nature of global events.\nIt can also do so as a result of fiscal and monetary measures taken to ease the previous one.\nL-shaped recovery\nCourtesy: Business Insider\n\nThe L-shaped recovery represents the worst-case situation. Even after several years, the economy in this case is unable to reach its peak GDP. It\u2019s sometimes called \u2018depression\u2019.\n\nOf all forms, this has the longest recessionary time. Sometimes the decline and the gradual recovery persist eternally.\nIt can take years for the economy to get back to where it was pre-downturn, and in some cases, this slow revival drags on indefinitely.\nK-shaped economic recovery\nCourtesy: Business Insider\n\nThe K-shaped recovery differs from the others in a small way. It\u2019s a relatively new phrase coined to explain what economists believe the COVID-19 epidemic would bring about.\n\nIn this scenario, one sector of the economy has a recovery that is more V-shaped or U-shaped, while another either continue to decline or recovers considerably more slowly, as in the case of the L-shaped recovery.\nThe two diagonal lines of the letter K represent this separation between two distinct economic groupings.\nIndustries and people are both impacted groups.\nHigh-tech and e-commerce are two examples of sectors that were able to continue operating or even prosper throughout the pandemic, whereas other industries had significant slowdowns or were essentially unable to function (i.e., travel and hospitality, arts and entertainment).\nCertain sections of the economy will recover more quickly due to large-cap corporations and public-sector organizations that have access to government aid and central bank stimulus programs.\nBlue-collar employees and small and medium-sized businesses are excluded from the recovery process.\nThe two diagonal lines of the letter K signify the split between these two groupings.\nSuch a rebound occurs when several sectors of the economy improve at wildly dissimilar speeds.\nConclusion\n\nThe most typical recoveries are V-shaped and U-shaped, while the other forms are not unusual.\n\nThe shortest time spent in the recession\u2019s trough makes a V-shaped rebound the best-case scenario, while an L-shaped recovery is a worst-case scenario since it has the longest recovery.\n\nThese letters only provide a portion of the tale, though. The length and character of the economic recovery are described, but the depth of the recession that preceded it is not.\n\nIt is impossible to determine the type of shape of economic recovery when in the middle of a recession. Economists can provide educated predictions once the key economic indicators such as GDP, employment, and inflation (price increases, due to growing demand) begin to respond.\n\nThe shape of economic recovery is not an exact science, but the predictions help governments, investors, and consumers alike in planning monetary policies and investments.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Hence, the investors have to rely on the credit ratings of the issuing company as security.\n\nFixed deposits:\n\nFixed deposits (FDs) are one of the most popular investment products as they are versatile and flexible.\nBanks, certain Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs), and even post offices issue fixed deposits.\nThey are popular due to their ease of investment, liquidity (except in tax-saving FDs), and uncomplicated nature.\n\nDebt mutual funds:\n\nDebt Mutual funds invest the pooled money in fixed-income products like government securities, corporate bonds, and some part in money market instruments.\nDebt funds, also known as fixed-income funds, are considered less volatile than equity funds as they invest in fixed-income products. They also have a low-cost structure.\n\nCertificates of deposit\n\nCertificates of Deposit (CDs), introduced in India in 1989, are short-term debt instruments.\nBanks and Financial Institutions issue CDs in dematerialized form against the funds that an investor deposits for a specific term.\nThe Reserve Bank of India lays down guidelines from time to time for their issue and operation.\nBanks must maintain the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) on the price of CDs.\nAll individual residents in India are eligible to buy certificates of deposit. The minimum duration of a CD issued by a bank is seven days and goes up to one year\n\nPublic provident fund:\n\nThe Public Provident Fund (PPF) scheme is a popular long-term investment product. PPFs have been around since 1968.\nIn this investment option, you put aside a small sum of money regularly to create wealth in the long term.\nInterest rates are fixed by the government quarterly. And the Investment and returns are tax-exempt.\nPublic debt\n\nPublic debt is the total amount borrowed by the government of a country when the government\u2019s revenue from taxes and other sources falls short of its spending requirements.\n\nIn India, public debt includes the total liabilities of the Union government that have to be paid from the Consolidated Fund of India (Article 292).\n\nIt is further classified into internal & external debt. Internal debt is categorized into marketable and non-marketable securities.\n\nMarketable government securities include G-secs and T-Bills issued through auction.\nNon-marketable securities include intermediate treasury bills issued to state governments and special securities issued to national Small Savings Fund among others.\n\nSometimes, the term is also used to refer to the overall liabilities of the central and state governments.\n\nHowever, the Union government clearly distinguishes its debt liabilities from those of the states.\nIt calls the overall liabilities of both the Union government and state General Government Debt (GGD) or Consolidated General Government Debt.\n\nThe internal debt comprises loans raised in the open market.\n\nIt also includes borrowings through treasury bills including treasury bills issued by state governments, commercial banks, and other investors.\nIt also includes non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing rupee securities issues to international financial institutions.\n\nThe part of a nation\u2019s debt that is borrowed from foreign lenders, such as commercial banks, governments, or international financial institutions, is referred to as its external debt.\n\nThese loans must typically be repaid in the currency used to make the loan, plus any applicable interest.\nThe borrowing nation may sell and export items to the lending nation to get the required cash.\n\nThe amount of the government\u2019s debt is crucial since a sizable portion of annual payments (around 25%) are made merely to cover the interest on the previous debt. For the current fiscal year, the government\u2019s debt is predicted to be about 62% of GDP.\n\nThe debt-to-GDP ratio shows how probable it is that the nation will be able to pay off its debt. Investors frequently use the debt-to-GDP ratio to determine the capacity of the government to finance its debt. Global economic crises have been fueled by higher debt-to-GDP ratios.\n\nAlso read: Budget Documents Made Simple\n\nPublic debt management\n\nSovereign or public debt management is the process of establishing and executing a strategy for managing the government\u2019s debt to raise the required amount of funding.\n\nIt aims to achieve its risk and cost objectives and to meet any other sovereign debt management goals the government may have set, such as developing and maintaining an efficient market for government securities.\n\nIn 2015, the creation of a statutory body called Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) was envisaged in India.\n\nAs the RBI set interest rates and conducted the purchase and sale of government bonds, it raised issues of conflict of interest.\nTill the time a PDMA comes into place, the government created an interim arrangement that deals with the management of public debt called the Public Debt Management Cell.\nPublic Debt Management Cell\n\nPublic Debt Management Cell is an interim arrangement before setting up an independent and statutory debt management agency namely the Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA).\n\nPDMC has the following advisory functions to the Government:\n\nPlan borrowings of the Government, including market borrowings, other domestic borrowings, SGBs\nManage Central Government\u2019s liabilities including NSSF, and contingent liabilities.\nMonitor cash balances of the Government, improve cash forecasting, and promote efficient cash management practices.\nAdvise other Divisions in DEA on matters related to External Debt involving external borrowings through MI, Bilateral cooperation, and other possible sources, in terms of cost, tenure, currency, hedging requirements, etc., and monitor developments in foreign exchange markets.\nFoster a liquid and efficient market for Government securities\nDevelop interfaces with various stakeholders/agencies in the regulatory/financial architecture etc. to carry out assigned functions efficiently.\nAdvice on matters related to investment and capital market operations.\nUndertake research work related to new product development, market development, risk management, debt sustainability assessment, other debt management functions, etc.\nDevelop a database system for collecting and maintaining a comprehensive database of Government of India liabilities on a near real-time basis and shall be responsible for the publication of relevant information.\nCarry out Preparatory work for independent PDMA.\nConclusion\n\nAn excessive level of public debt can result in higher interest rates, which has a crowding effect on the amount of private investment in the economy and the rate of economic expansion as a whole.\n\nAlthough it temporarily boosts overall demand, if left unchecked it can cause a country\u2019s economy to experience spiraling losses.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

Borrowing can enable countries to finance important development programs and projects but, taken too far, the burden of debt repayment can overwhelm a country\u2019s finances, at worst leading to default.\n\nAlso read: Public Debt: Overview\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDebt sustainability\nDebt sustainability analysis\nChallenges to Developing Country Debt Sustainability\nIndia\u2019s debt sustainability\nHow to make public debt sustainable?\nIn news\nWay forward\nDebt sustainability\n\nA country\u2019s public debt is considered sustainable if the government can meet all its current and future payment obligations without exceptional financial assistance or going into default.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe definition of public debt varies depending on its purpose. A commonly used narrow definition of public debt covers the budgetary central government.\nA broader definition is the general government (budgetary central government, state, and local government, extrabudgetary units, and social security funds).\n\nTo properly assess a country\u2019s debt sustainability, it is important to cover all types of debt that pose a risk to a country\u2019s public finances.\n\nIn advanced economies and emerging markets, debt sustainability analysis frequently focuses on the general government.\n\nHowever, in low-income countries nearly complete coverage of both public and publicly guaranteed debt is standard.\n\nAssessments of debt sustainability carried out by the IMF and World Bank cover both domestic and external public sector debt.\n\nBut sovereign credit rating agencies that focus on the risk of debt distress typically concentrate on market-based external public sector debt.\n\nAlso read: US Debt Ceiling Crisis and US Federal Government Shut down Explained\n\nDebt sustainability analysis\n\nThe World Bank Group and the IMF work with low-income countries to produce regular Debt Sustainability Analyses, which are structured examinations of developing country debt based on the Debt Sustainability Framework.\n\nThis area of work has three goals:\n\nEnsure that countries that have received debt relief are on a sustainable development track.\nAllow creditors to better anticipate future risks and tailor their financing terms accordingly.\nHelp client countries balance their needs for funds with the ability to repay their debts.\n\nThe objective of this analysis is to support efforts by low-income countries to achieve their development goals while minimizing their risk of experiencing debt distress.\n\nDebt crises are costly to debtors, creditors, and the international monetary and financial system.\nDebt sustainability analysis plays a critical role in guiding borrowing and lending decisions.\n\nAlso read: Budget Documents Made Simple\n\nChallenges to Developing Country Debt Sustainability\n\nSince the global financial crisis, economies around the world have become dependent on debt for their growth.\n\nThis has encouraged unprecedented global indebtedness, particularly in emerging markets and developing countries which have little control over global trends.\n\nWithin the global financial system, developing countries have a limited number of choices, and proposals for regional and inter-regional monetary and financial cooperation and reliance on directed development banking are set out as a place to start.\nIn recent years, developing countries have faced renewed financial stress due to increased and premature connectivity to international financial markets.\nThe constraints imposed by a world with policy parameters shaped by unregulated international financial markets are particularly binding on developing countries.\nUnregulated capital inflows can lead to exchange rate appreciation, reducing the competitiveness of the domestic industry and hurting export earnings.\n\nThe challenge for the Governments of increasingly vulnerable economies is finding room to maneuver to manage debt sustainably while ensuring growth-inducing expenditure to enhance development.\n\nWhat developing countries require most is long-term access to foreign demand, and thus reliable export markets to support their emergent domestic growth, and investment to repay external debt.\n\nDeveloping countries have expanded and opened their domestic financial markets to non-resident investors, foreign commercial banks, and financial institutions prematurely\n\nThey have also allowed their citizens to invest abroad and, many developing country Governments are engaged in raising finance in developed country financial markets.\nIndia\u2019s debt sustainability\n\nThe sustainability of public debt is one of the critical issues from the point of view of policymakers.\n\nBefore Independence, the borrowing needs of Indian princely states were largely met by indigenous bankers and financiers.\nThe concept of borrowing from the public was pioneered by the East India Company to finance the Anglo-French wars during the 18th century.\nThe First World War saw a rise in India\u2019s public debt due to the country\u2019s contribution to the British exchequer.\nThe provinces of British India were allowed to float loans for the first time in 1920 when the local government borrowing rules were issued under the Government of India Act, of 1919.\n\nIndia\u2019s public debt (combined liabilities of the Central and State governments) to gross domestic product (GDP), at constant prices, increased to a record high of 100.86 percent in 2020.\n\nHow to make public debt sustainable?\n\nThe following measures may be adopted by the government to make public debt sustainable in the medium to long term:\n\nThe government may think of privatizing loss-making public sector undertakings (PSUs).\nThe government may run any business if it is socially relevant, technologically feasible, environmentally friendly, economically viable, politically acceptable, legally unassailable, and ethically right.\nIt is the government\u2019s responsibility to control fiscal wastefulness and to achieve long-term macroeconomic sustainability through the effective conduct of monetary policy and prudential debt management in a transparent manner.\nAs part of better fiscal deficit management, and maintaining enhanced transparency and accountability, the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) should be leveraged to the maximum.\nThe government may think of the public-private partnership (PPP) model in social schemes.\nThe government needs to focus on investment in infrastructure and human capital.\nGST needs to be harmonized and expanded to other areas to reach a national consensus to improve the tax-GDP ratio.\nThe government should create an investor-friendly environment for additional sources of financing to replace the high public debt.\nThe government should enhance the efficiency of public debt management by adhering to low cost, risk mitigation, and market development.\nThrust on renewable energy can push the Indian economy to 5 trillion dollars by 2025. It is pertinent to reduce reliance on fossil fuels which will save foreign exchange.\nIn news\n\nThe first G20 finance ministers and central bank governors (FMCBG) meeting concluded recently to address debt vulnerabilities.\n\nThe steps agreed upon at the meeting were:\n\nStraightening multilateral coordination by official bilateral and private creditors.\nPredictable and coordinated implementation of a Common framework for debt treatments beyond the Debt service suspension initiative of the world bank.\nTo enhance macro policy cooperation and support the progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nTo develop a globally fair, sustainable, and modern international tax system fit for purpose for the 21st century.\nWay forward\n\nGlobal growth remains slow, and downside risks to the outlook persist, including elevated inflation, a resurgence of the pandemic, and tighter financing conditions that could worsen debt vulnerabilities in many Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs).\n\nThe governments should make the public debt sustainable by carefully building their strategy in lines of growth achieved through financial stability.\n\nThe global focus should be to assist developing countries in attaining long-term debt sustainability through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief, and debt restructuring, as appropriate, and addressing the external debt of highly indebted poor countries to reduce debt distress.\n\nSustainable finance is critical in achieving sustainable, resilient, inclusive, and equitable economic growth which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nThe need of the hour is for the international community to step up its efforts to effectively combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing to enhance the integrity and resilience of the international financial system.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

To increase India\u2019s creativity, the government must fund talent and research projects.\nClinical trials and subjectivity in specific regulatory decision-making should be encouraged by the government.\nIndia depends substantially on foreign nations for intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). China is the source of imports for 80% of APIs.\nIndia is thus at the mercy of erratic price changes and supply interruptions. To stabilize supply, it is required to implement infrastructure improvements in the area of internal facilities.\nSince 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has conducted the most inspections in India; as a result, continuing investments in raising quality standards would divert money away from other areas of growth and development.\nDue to the difficulty posed by India\u2019s frequent and unforeseen adjustments to its domestic pricing policies; the climate for investments and ideas has become hazy.\nGovernment initiatives for the pharma sector\n\nThe Indian pharmaceuticals market is supported by the following Production Linked Incentive Schemes to boost domestic manufacturing capacity, including high-value products across the global supply chain.\n\nPLI Scheme for Key Starting Materials (KSMs)/Drug Intermediates (DIs) and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) (PLI 1.0)\nProduction-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Pharmaceuticals d (PLI 2.0)\n\nThe products under the PLI schemes are divided into 3 categories:\n\nCategory 1: Biopharmaceuticals, Complex generic drugs, Patented drugs or drugs nearing patent expiry, Cell-based or gene therapy products, Orphan drugs, Special empty capsules, Complex excipients, Phyto-pharmaceuticals\nCategory 2: Active Pharma Ingredients (APIs), Key Starting Materials (KSMs), Drug Intermediaries (Dls)\nCategory 3: Repurposed Drugs, Auto-immune drugs, Anti-cancer drugs, Anti-diabetic drugs, Anti Infective drugs, Cardiovascular drugs, Psychotropic drugs, Anti-Retroviral drugs, Fermentation based 4 KSMs /DIs\n\nUnder the \u2018Promotion of Bulk Drug Parks\u2019 Scheme, the Union government aims to develop 3 mega Bulk Drug parks in India in partnership with the States.\n\nThe parks will have common facilities such as a solvent recovery plant, distillation plant, power & steam units, and a common effluent treatment plant.\n\nStrengthening of Pharmaceutical Industry (SPI) Scheme was announced in 2022 and received a 500-crore financial outlay for the period FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26.\n\nThe objective of the scheme is to foster resilience and future readiness in the existing infrastructure facilities to make India a global leader in the Pharma Sector.\n\nPromotion of medical devices parks\n\nThe objective of the scheme is the Creation of world-class infrastructure facilities to make the Indian medical device industry a global leader\nEasy access to standard testing and infrastructure facilities through the creation of world-class Common Infrastructure Facilities for increased competitiveness will result in a significant reduction in the cost of production of medical devices leading to better availability and affordability of medical devices in the domestic market.\n\nScheme for the Establishment of AYUSH Super Specialty Hospitals/ Day Care Centres for Medical Tourism\n\nThe Champion Services Sector Scheme for Medical Value Travel has been framed by Govt. of India to enhance Medical Tourism in the country, especially in the field of the Traditional System of Medicine\nThe objective of the scheme is to encourage private investors to invest in the AYUSH sector through the Establishment of World Class, State of Art Super Specialty Hospitals/ Day Care Centres of the systems recognized under the Indian Medicine Central Council (IMCC) Act, 1970 or Homeopathic Central Council (HCC) Act, 1973.\nThe scheme is for promoting the export of medical value travel services including services supplied to foreign consumers in India by providing interest subsidy.\n\nPharmaceuticals Promotion Development Scheme (PPDS)\n\nUnder the PPDS, the Department of Pharmaceuticals aims to:\n\nConduct Training/knowledge improvement programs/activities on issues/subjects relevant to the growth of the pharmaceutical industry.\nOrganize Summits, conventions, Exhibitions, Pharmacy week, meetings, etc. in India and abroad and produce promotional materials like films, displays, etc.\nConduct research studies, sector reports, etc.\nWay forward\n\nThe Indian pharmaceutical industry is a significant part of the nation\u2019s foreign trade and offers lucrative potential for investors.\n\nMillions of people around the world receive affordable and inexpensive generic medications from India, which also runs a sizable number of plants that adhere to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA).\n\nThe capacity of firms to orient their product portfolio towards chronic treatments for diseases like cardiovascular, anti-diabetes, anti-depressants, and anti-cancers, which are on the increase, will also play a role in future domestic sales growth.\n\nThe Indian government has taken several measures to cut expenditures and lower healthcare prices.\n\nThe opening of pharmacies that provide low-cost generic medications as well as other government initiatives, such as the National Health Protection Scheme, which aims to provide universal healthcare, the aging population, the rise in chronic diseases, and other factors should all help to strengthen the Indian pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThe quick entry of generic medications into the market has remained a priority and is anticipated to help Indian pharmaceutical businesses.

What are the causes and how these differences can be minimised?\n\nDespite the existence of the Equal Remuneration Act of 1976, neither the law nor the courts have been able to preserve a fundamental human right of gender equality that is guaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nIndia wants more women to participate in its public and economic life, but it is unable to shield them from unfair wages and discriminatory employment possibilities.\n\nIn this light, let us discuss gender pay parity in detail.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Gender Pay Parity?\nThe Gender Pay Gap is Not the Same as Equal Pay\nWhy and Where the Country is Lacking?\nWhat Causes the Gender Pay Parity?\nHow Can We Reduce Gender Pay Parity?\nWhat Needs to be Done to Arrest This Decline?\nWhat is Gender Pay Parity?\n\nThe Gender Pay Parity or Gender Wage Gap is defined as the average difference between the remuneration for working men and women. Recently it was in the news because the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced to provide equal pay to men and women cricketers in international cricket which is a historic move.\n\nAs per International Labour Organization (ILO), women on average continue to be paid about 20 per cent less than men across the world. In some countries, the difference is as high as 45 per cent. As a result, there\u2019s a lifetime of income inequality between men and women and more women are retiring into poverty.\n\nAccording to a report on time use, published by National Sample Survey (NSS) in 2019, women spend 299 minutes a day on unpaid domestic services for which men spend only 97 minutes. Only 22% of women aged 15-59 years were engaged in paid work in comparison to nearly 71% of men.

The disparity widens among mothers, immigrant women, and women of colour. The so-called \u201cmotherhood penalty,\u201d which forces women into the informal sector, casual employment, and part-time employment, is more prevalent in developing countries than it is in developed countries.\n\nThe Gender Pay Gap is Not the Same as Equal Pay\n\nEqual pay is when men and women are paid equally for performing the same role or different work of equal or comparable value.\n\nSince 1969, this has been a legal requirement in Australia.\n\nGender pay gaps are not a comparison of like roles.\u00a0Instead, they show the difference between the average pay of women and men across organisations, industries and the workforce as a whole.\n\nRead: Income inequality\n\nWhy and Where the Country is Lacking?\n\nIndia ranks lowest in Health and Survival, and Economic Participation and Opportunity. Recently, the World Economic Forum (WEF) ranked India at\u00a0135 out of 146 countries\u00a0in its Global Gender Gap (GGG) Index for 2022.\n\nIndia has consistently scored poorly and ranked poorly in several categories. According to the report, the rank in the former has been low, owing to the low sex ratio at birth.\n\nAccording to the most recent National Family Health Survey (NFHS), the sex ratio at birth was 929 females to 1,000 males for children born in the last five years. However, the natural sex ratio at birth, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is approximately 952 females to every 1,000 males.\n\nIf we talk about Economic Participation and Opportunity, according to the Periodic Labour Force Survey\u2019s 2020-21 annual report, the labour force participation rate among Indian women is just 23.15 per cent, in contrast to 57.75 per cent in men.\n\nAccording to NFHS 2019-21, just 25.2% of the surveyed women had jobs at the time, compared to 74.8% of the surveyed men.\n\nAccording to the Gender Gap Report, \u201cthe most unequal economies with less than 65% of wealth equity are Nigeria, Argentina, Mexico, Turkey, and India.\u201d This indicates that on average, women in these nations only assemble less than 65% of the wealth that men do by the time they retire. India received a score of between 60% and 64%.\n\nAlso read: Global Gender Gap Report\n\nWhat Causes the Gender Pay Parity?\n\nThe gap between women\u2019s and men\u2019s average earnings is the result of social and economic factors that combine to reduce women\u2019s earning capacity over their lifetime.\n\nThese factors include:\n\nConscious and unconscious discrimination and bias in hiring and pay decisions\nUnder-representation in leadership\nWomen and men working in different industries and different jobs, with female-dominated industries and jobs attracting lower wages\nWomen more than men are more likely to take career breaks from their employment in order to raise children. That makes them\u00a0likely to have fallen behind in advancement and in remuneration.\nLack of workplace flexibility to accommodate caring and other responsibilities, especially in senior roles\nHigh rates of part-time work for women\nWomen\u2019s greater time out of the workforce for caring responsibilities impacts career progression and opportunities\nIt can be challenging for them to obtain and maintain a job in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines because they are traditionally male-dominated.\nHow Can We Reduce Gender Pay Parity?\n\nTo remove the obstacles preventing women from participating fully and equally in the workforce, a cultural shift is necessary to close the gender wage gap.\n\nSome of the ways to reduce the gender pay gap include:\n\nConducting an audit to understand the size of the gender pay gap\nReporting the findings to management and employees\nPromoting a gender-inclusive business culture while adopting a holistic approach to equal remuneration for women and men for work of equal value.\nTaking action to increase the number of women in leadership positions\nEncouraging men to access flexible work arrangements and leave entitlements.\nMaking jobs more flexible so that more women access higher-level jobs and, therefore, higher pay.\nMaking equitable salary offers to men and women.\nEncouraging women\u2019s participation in leadership roles as well.\nWomen\u2019s education must be promoted.\nWhat Needs to be Done to Arrest This Decline?\n\nThe report criticises the rising inequality in the number of women holding offices in India. This scenario could be improved by passing the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill, which would reserve 33% of all seats in the Lok Sabha and all State legislative assemblies for women. Also, steps could be taken to close the gender wage gap in all industries.\n\nAccording to estimates from the World Inequality Report 2022, men in India make up 82% of the labour force while women make up 18%. Also, there is room to increase funding for the gender budget, which strives to guarantee that women have equal access to socioeconomic advantages as men.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Read further to know more.\n\nThe government has announced the National IPR policy to advance the IPR regime.\n\nThe strategy will promote entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation in India.\n\nLet us discuss more on India\u2019s IPR policy.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRegarding the Policy\nGoals of the IPR policy\nRequirement of an IPR Policy\nDetails of IPR policy\nBenefits of IPR policy\nDisadvantages\nMajor outcomes of the new National IPR policy\nConclusion\nRegarding the Policy\n\nThe policy\u2019s slogan is \u201cCreative India, Innovative India\u201d. The main aim is to discourage the production and selling of fake goods and to encourage entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation.\n\nThe intellectual property encourages advancement in S&T, art and culture, traditional knowledge, and biodiversity resources; knowledge is the primary driver of development, and knowledge owned is transformed into knowledge shared. This promotes an India where creativity and innovation are encouraged by IP for the benefit of all.\nIt establishes a formal system for implementation, oversight, and evaluation. It tries to adapt and modify best practices from around the world for the Indian context.\nIPRs in India are being implemented and will continue to develop under the direction of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce, Government of India.\nThe WTO\u2019s agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights is upheld by India\u2019s IPR regime (TRIPS).\nThe National IPR Policy\u2019s goals are to be carried out by the \u201cCell for IPR Promotion & Management (CIPAM),\u201d which was established under the supervision of DPIIT.\nGoals of the IPR policy\n\nThere are seven main goals:\n\nIPR, outreach, and promotion\u2014raising public understanding of IPRs\u2019 positive effects on the economy, society, and culture.\nEncourage the creation of IPRs by cultivating an environment that is inventive and innovative.\nReplace obsolete rules with strong, effective IPR laws that combine the rights holders\u2019 interests with the broader public interest.\nHuman Capital Development for Intellectual Property Education, Research, and Skill Building Human resources, institutions, and capacities are strengthened and expanded by rights.\nModernize and improve service-oriented IPR administration through the administration and management of innovation\nIPR commercialization \u2013 Commercialization can be used to maximise IPR value.\nStrengthening the enforcement and adjudicative processes to combat IPR infringements\n\nThe policy established a legal framework that will support the IPR regime and shorten the time it takes for a trademark to be approved by the government to one month. At the moment, the procedure takes longer than a year.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRequirement of an IPR Policy\nIt is crucial for the government to offer incentives in the form of tax breaks in order to promote research and development.\nThe US Trade Representative (USTR) kept India on its \u201cPriority Watch List\u201d in its annual Special 301 Report (on the Global State of IPR Protection and Enforcement) for the 2016 edition.\nTo protect innovations so that there are fewer legal disputes in this area.\nIt will aid in preserving Indian traditional knowledge.\nIt will contribute to the improvement of the Startup, Make In India, and Digital India programs.\nDetails of IPR policy\n\nThe IPR policy was developed, following extensive stakeholder consultation with close to 300 organizations and people by an IPR Think Tank, as well as with 31 departments of the Government of India.\n\nApproved by the Indian government on May 12th, 2016.\nIn order to create and utilise synergies between all types of intellectual property (IP), relevant statutes, and agencies, a vision statement that embraces and unifies all IPRs must take into account all interlinkages within the Indian IP ecosystem.\nAttempts to incorporate and adapt international best practices to the Indian situation by establishing an institutional system for implementation, monitoring, and review.\nReiterates India\u2019s adherence to the TRIPS agreement and the Doha Development Agenda\nRecognizes that India has a solid legislative, judicial, and administrative framework for protecting IPRs that comply with TRIPS.\nBalances the greater public interest with the rights holders\u2019 interests\nIn order to assure the monetization of India\u2019s \u201cfrugal engineering\u201d strength, it is necessary to raise awareness about IPRs as a marketable financial asset and economic tool.\nEnsures that the IP regime in India is characterised by a single-mindedness of goal and direction, serving as a guide for the IPR regime in India for times to come.\nPositions India as an innovation-friendly country and allows for the effective use of the strengths of all stakeholders.\nTo promote innovation and creativity by presenting the world with a dynamic and predictable IP regime that includes a stable, transparent, and service-oriented IPR administration.\nFive-year reviews of the IPR Policy will be conducted by a committee under the Secretary of the DIPP.\nBenefits of IPR policy\n\nThe proposed IPR policy regime has the following benefits:\n\nIt is a vision plan that seeks to build connections among all types of intellectual property, relevant laws, and government organisations.\nIt would harmonise India\u2019s IP regime with international standards and raise India\u2019s Ease of Doing Business score on the World Bank.\nThe policy promotes investments in India by potential investors and strategic partners while ensuring credibility.\nIt will decrease the amount of time needed to process the backlog of IPR applications.\nIt works to improve access to healthcare, food security, and environmental protection while preventing the piracy of movies and music.\nA stable, open, and service-oriented IPR administration in the nation is made possible by policy, which also encourages creativity and innovation across industries.\nIt will raise awareness, which will contribute to creating a culture that supports innovation and creativity and produce commercially viable, protectable intellectual property.\nIndustry and people would gain from the Copyright Act and Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout-Design Act being brought under DIPP.\nDue to better administrative convergence, the commercial relevance of IPRs will be better affected when they are housed under one roof.\nAll facets of society are to be made aware of the social, economic, and cultural benefits of IPRs.\nDisadvantages\n\nThe proposed national IPR policy also has some disadvantages like the following.\n\nThe Doha Declaration on World Trade Organization (WTO) TRIPS (Trade-Related IPR Agreement) and Public Health is a commitment made by India, according to the IPR Policy. However, there was some concern that the inclusion of the Doha Declaration and flexibility would lead to attempts to undermine TRIPS in order to benefit pharmaceutical firms.\nIn the absence of financing and programmes to enable universal access to healthcare, any change in the legal system would be detrimental to both the generic industry and the Indian populace.\nTraditional knowledge and the informal creativity/innovations based on it are not addressed in the policy.\nAbsence of proof supporting the value of current trade secret and utility model legislation in fostering unofficial innovation.\nEven while it claimed that the primary responsibility for securing IP rights was on the IP owner, it envisions significant government investment in protecting and promoting foreign IP in India.\nFurthermore, the mention of State laws in the context of copyright protection demonstrated how the policy was biased in favour of IP owners rather than society.\nFew experts believe that the National IPR strategy is insufficient for promoting innovation since it lacks specificity.\nIt presupposes that greater IP leads to greater innovation. It fails to comprehend that IP is merely a means to an end and not an end in and of itself.\nThe policy urges that all knowledge be turned into IP.\nCorporates have also acknowledged that certain technical industries, where a free flow of open knowledge is more appropriate, do not work well with IP.\nExperts are also dubious about the policy\u2019s application to the rural informal economy.\nBecause rural economies and creativity are not well understood. In rural places, adopting a formal IP policy may cause more harm than good.\nLastly, making violations of the Indian Cinematograph Act illegal is excessively harsh and unjust. IP wrongs are essentially civil wrongs, so they shouldn\u2019t be made illegal.\nMajor outcomes of the new National IPR policy\n\nThe following are the major outcomes of the new IPR policy.\n\nIndia\u2019s position in the WIPO-issued Global Innovation Index (GII) rose from 81st in 2015 to 48th in 2020.\n\u00a0Compared to the same period in 2017\u201318, patent filings climbed by about 7% in the first eight months of 2018\u201319. Over this time, there has been an almost 28% increase in trademark filings.\nEnhancing institutional mechanisms for promoting and protecting IP\nThe government\u2019s increase in technical manpower has led to a significant decrease in the amount of time that IP Applications are pending.\nAnother innovation is the automatic issuance of the electronically created patent and trademark certificates.\nProcesses have been streamlined and made more user-friendly in accordance with the IP Process Re-engineering Patent Rules, 2003. Trademarks Rules have been updated and announced in 2017.\nIPR Awareness-Building IPR Awareness seminars have been carried out for businesses, law enforcement, the judicial system, and even rural schools using satellite communication.\nCenters for Technology and Innovation Support (TISCs) have been set up in numerous universities across various states in conjunction with WIPO.\nConclusion\n\nThe IPRs policy would go a long way toward encouraging the Indian sector to develop as well as to preserve and enforce their innovations, but other areas still need more examination, such as the idea of information sharing and knowledge access.\n\nThe expansion of the innovation ecosystem with improved IPR protection is necessary for the success of India\u2019s flagship initiatives, Make in India and Startup India. The expansion of the protection to include items that are in the public domain is also causing some worry. More foreign investment in the nation could be attracted with better policy enforcement.\n\nIt appears that the policy\u2019s approach to copyrights and trademarks is designed to meet the interests of foreign businesses. They will be more motivated if rights are granted more quickly and are strictly enforced. The policy\u2019s approach to digital piracy, which suggests harsher measures for addressing the problem, is one of its main features.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

Read further to know more about Credit Rating in India.\n\nIn today\u2019s financial world, credit rating is an essential factor that plays a crucial role in determining the creditworthiness of an individual or a business entity.\n\nWith the advent of globalization, credit rating has become increasingly important in India, as it directly affects the access to finance and the cost of borrowing.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the credit rating system in India, its significance, and the factors that affect it.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Credit Rating?\nWho Evaluates Credit Ratings in India?\nHow do Credit Rating Agencies Work in India?\nTypes of Credit Rating\nUsers of Credit Ratings\nSignificance of Credit Rating\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between Credit Rating and Credit Score?\nFactors Affecting Credit Rating in India\nFactors Affecting Credit Scores in India\nConclusion\nWhat is Credit Rating?\n\nA credit rating is an evaluation of a borrower\u2019s creditworthiness, either generally or in relation to a specific debt or financial obligation.\nAny organisation looking to borrow money, whether it be a person, business, state or local authority, or sovereign nation, can be given a credit rating.\n\nCredit rating companies assign ratings to entities after evaluating their financial and business risk. After considering additional variables like the ability to repay the loan, the firms compile a thorough report.\n\nWho Evaluates Credit Ratings in India?\n\nAn Indian credit agency assesses the borrower\u2019s credit rating by looking at both their quantitative and qualitative characteristics. The credit rating agency examines a variety of data, including financial statements, annual reports, analyst reports, news articles, industry analyses, and projections for the upcoming quarter, which ultimately aids them in deciding what grade to assign the organisation.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCredit Rating Information Services of India Limited (CRISIL), ICRA Limited, Credit Analysis and Research Limited (CARE), India Rating and Research Private Limited, etc. are a few of the leading credit rating agencies in India.\n\nThe SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 govern all credit rating agencies in India.\n\nHow do Credit Rating Agencies Work in India?\n\nEach rating agency uses a different formula to determine credit ratings. Companies, state governments, non-profit organisations, nations, securities, special purpose entities, and local governmental bodies are all rated by agencies.\n\nBefore evaluating a business, credit rating agencies analyze a number of variables, including the financial statements, level and kind of debt, lending and borrowing history, capacity to repay debt, and previous debts of the entity. After a credit rating agency rates the entities, it gives the investor additional information, which the investor then analyses and uses to make wise investment decisions.\n\nThe entities\u2019 credit ratings are used as a standard for financial market regulations. It should be highlighted, though, that the ratings should not be viewed as investment advice but rather as a tool for making wise choices.\n\nAlso read: Indian Economy Statistics: Know India Better\n\nTypes of Credit Rating\n\nAll credit agency businesses use a variety of terminologies to generate credit scores. Therefore, ratings are divided into two categories: \u201cInvestment-grade\u201d and \u201cSpeculative grade.\u201d\n\nInvestment Grade: Investment-grade ratings indicate a safe investment with a high probability that the issuer will adhere to the terms of the repayment. These investments cost less than investments of a speculative grade.\nSpeculative Grade: These assets are rated as speculative because of their high risk. Therefore, they have higher interest rates.\nUsers of Credit Ratings\nInstitutional and Individual Investors: Both institutional and retail investors utilize credit ratings to determine the portfolio-level risk associated with investing in a particular issuance.\nIntermediaries: Investment bankers fall under the category of intermediaries since they utilize credit ratings to assess credit risk and determine how much debts should cost.\nDebt Issuers: Debt issuers, which include municipalities, corporations, and governments, utilize credit ratings to determine their creditworthiness. They also consider the credit risk connected to the issue of debt. The ratings might also provide potential investors with a sense of the instrument\u2019s quality.\nCorporations and Businesses: They try to assess the risk connected with a counterparty transaction. Credit ratings assist organizations in assessing the viability of joint ventures and business partnerships with other firms.\nSignificance of Credit Rating\nA borrower\u2019s creditworthiness is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively through credit rating.\nAfter considering the risk factor and prior repayment behaviour, it enables investors to make a wise investment choice. To put it another way, it creates a connection between risk and reward.\nIn the case of companies, credit ratings assist them in enhancing their brand. Particularly for unpopular companies, it is helpful.\nCredit rating serves as both a marketing tool and a resource for businesses when they are trying to raise capital. It lowers the cost of borrowing and aids in business growth.\nIf an organization has a better credit rating, lenders like banks and financial institutions would give loans at a reduced interest rate. On the other side, a decreased credit rating implies that the company\u2019s ability to make payments has diminished.\nImproved financial information, thorough information sharing, and better accounting practices are all encouraged by credit ratings.\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between Credit Rating and Credit Score?\n\nAfter determining a company\u2019s or organization\u2019s capacity to pay back the borrowed sum, credit rating firms issue that entity a credit rating. In the meanwhile, credit bureaus calculate a credit score after taking into account a number of variables, including credit history and payback behaviour.\n\nFactors Affecting Credit Rating in India\n\nSeveral elements that could have an impact on a company\u2019s credit rating in India include:\n\nHistory of the Company: The credit rating agency examines the company\u2019s prior performance, including its history of borrowing and when it has repaid its debts. If a corporation makes late payments or defaults on loans, this can have a negative impact on its credit rating.\nFuture Commercial Potential of the Company: A company\u2019s credit rating is also based on its potential for the future. The credit rating will give the company a good rating if projections, present performance, and other factors indicate that it will become profitable soon; alternatively, a negative rating will be issued if the future projections do not appear promising.\nFactors Affecting Credit Scores in India\n\nSeveral things can have an impact on your credit score, including:\n\nNot Paying Your Bills on Time: If you don\u2019t pay your credit card bills or loan payments on time, your credit score may suffer. Therefore, to maintain a good credit score, constantly be sure to pay your bills by the due date.\nCredit Utilization Ratio: To keep your credit score high, you should preferably keep your credit utilization ratio at 30% or less. Don\u2019t use your credit card for more than 30,000 rupees, for instance, if your credit card\u2019s limit is Rs. 1 lakh.\nDelayed Loan and Bill Payments: Your credit score increases if you pay all of your bills on time and repay your loan. You could have the option of making minimum payments, but this won\u2019t assist your credit score over time. Therefore, in order to maintain a good credit score, make sure you pay off all of your loans and credit card bills on time before applying for a new one.\nFrequently Applying for Loans and Credit Cards: The lender runs a credit investigation whenever you apply for a loan or credit card. Avoid applying for loans and credit cards frequently because doing so will lower your credit score because of too many credit inquiries.\nIncreasing Your Credit card Limit Frequently:\u00a0Increasing your credit card limit repeatedly may indicate that you rely significantly on credit to pay for your expenses, which might lower your credit score and make future loan offers from lenders unlikely. Increase your credit limit only if you are confident in your ability to pay the past-due account in a timely manner.\nNot Regularly Reviewing Your Credit Score: At a minimum, check your credit score every quarter. Your credit score could occasionally contain a little inaccuracy, which could then have an impact. If you discover a mistake, contact the credit bureau right once to have it corrected.\nHaving a Bad Credit Mix: Don\u2019t apply for only one kind of good. Don\u2019t, for instance, submit a personal loan application every time. Having a variety of loans demonstrates your ability to manage your finances, which raises your credit score. It should go without saying that you must make your loan payments on time to keep a good credit score.\nConclusion\n\nThe credit rating system in India plays a crucial role in the financial market by providing investors with information on the creditworthiness of debt securities. It helps in determining the risk associated with investing in a particular security and aids in making informed investment decisions. Overall, the credit rating industry in India has shown steady growth and improvement in recent years, with increased regulation and transparency. However, challenges such as conflicts of interest and limited coverage of certain segments of the market remain to be addressed.\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S",

The majority of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary care facilities are run by the private sector.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndia has 1.3 beds per 1,000 people, 0.5 pharmacists per 1,000 people, and 0.8 physicians per 1,000 people, which are all less than half the global average.\n\nQuality of Health Care Services\n\nIndia is ranked 145th out of 180 nations in terms of the accessibility and quality of healthcare, according to the Economic Survey (Global Burden of Disease Study 2016)\n\nDoctors\n\nTo achieve an ideal doctor-to-population ratio of 1:1000 by 2030, India will require an additional 2 million doctors.\n\nDisease Burden\n\nDespite having 17% of the world\u2019s population, India bears a disproportionately large portion of the global disease burden (20%).\n\nFunding\n\nIndia\u2019s public healthcare spending was 2.1% of GDP in 2021\u20132022, up from 1.8% in 2020\u20132021, according to the\u00a0Economic Survey of 2022.\n\nChallenges in Health Sector\n\nAlthough India\u2019s health sector has made significant progress in terms of health indicators, it still has some serious flaws in service delivery due to inadequate healthcare infrastructure.\n\nInadequate Accessibility\n\nInsufficient access to basic healthcare services to all, due to a shortage of medical professionals, a lack of quality assurance, and insufficient health spending.\n\nInsufficient Funding\n\nOne of the major concerns is the administration\u2019s lack of financial resources and insufficient funding for research and development.\n\nIndia\u2019s government will only spend 2.1% of its GDP on healthcare in 2021\u201322, compared to 10% for Japan, Canada, and France.\n\nNo focus on Preventive Care\n\nDespite being shown to be quite beneficial in alleviating a variety of difficulties for patients in terms of unhappiness and financial losses, preventive care is undervalued in India.\n\nShortage of Medical Workforce\n\nDoctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals are in short supply in India. According to a minister\u2019s study presented in Parliament, India is short 600,000 doctors.\n\nLack of Infrastructure\n\nPrivate hospitals are expensive, whereas Government hospitals are either inadequate or lacking in basic facilities for the Indian population.\n\nOptimal Insurance\n\nThe concept of health insurance is still unclear in India, and the market is underdeveloped.\n\nPolicymaking\n\nPolicymaking is undeniably important in providing effective and efficient healthcare services. The problem in India is one of supply rather than demand, and policy can help.\n\nPotential in Health Care Sector in India\n\nDespite the challenges, there were opportunities. The Indian healthcare system has a unique opportunity to advance while taking stock of the past and getting ready for the future while keeping the welfare of its people in mind.\n\nStrong Demand\n\nAccording to Aspire Circle, the Indian healthcare sector is expected to reach $744 billion by 2030, driven by greater access to insurance, better health awareness, lifestyle diseases, and rising income.\n\nInnovative Technologies\n\nAs part of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM), the digital Health ID will be introduced, which will save patient data. It would aid in effective policymaking, and private firms would benefit from a competitive advantage in the market introduction of innovative technology.\n\nWith the advent of information technology and big data, it would be simple for private players to spend strategically.\n\nRising Manpower\n\nThe abundance of highly qualified medical personnel in India is a competitive advantage. With 4.7 million workers as of 2021, the Indian healthcare industry is one of the country\u2019s largest employers.\n\nFrom 0.83 million in 2010 to 1.3 million in November 2021, the number of allopathic doctors with recognised medical qualifications (under the I.M.C Act) registered with state medical councils/national medical council\n\nCost Competent\n\nIndia\u2019s costs are competitive with those of its countries in Asia and the West. Surgery in India costs roughly a tenth of what it does in the US or Western Europe.\n\nAttractive Opportunities\n\nTwo vaccines Bharat Biotech\u2019s Covaxin and Oxford-Covishield, AstraZeneca\u2019s both made by SII were critical in protecting the Indian population from COVID-19.\n\nIndia has emerged as a hub for R&D activities for international players due to its relatively low cost of clinical research.\n\nWith the help of the government and private stakeholders, a climate conducive to start-ups and entrepreneurship can be created in this field.\n\nHub of Medical Tourism\n\nIndia is already one of the world\u2019s most popular medical tourism destinations, and this industry has significant potential in the coming years.\n\nThe low cost of medical services has resulted in a rise in the country\u2019s medical tourism, attracting patients from across the world.\n\nIndia possesses all the necessary factors for this industry to grow rapidly, including a sizable population, a strong pharmaceutical and medical supply chain, more than 750 million smartphone users, the third-largest global start-up pool with simple access to Venture Capital funding, and innovative tech entrepreneurs looking to address global healthcare issues.\n\nMeasures Required in the Health Sector\n\nThese are the following major measures for improving the health sector in India:\n\nStrengthening the Infrastructure: Because of India\u2019s large population, there is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure of public hospitals, which are overburdened.\nEncourage Private Hospitals: The government should support private hospitals because they contribute significantly to the Indian Health sector. The challenges are severe and cannot be addressed solely by the government, the private sector must also participate with Government for the public good.\nIncreased efficiency: More medical personnel must be hired in order to improve the sector\u2019s capabilities and efficiency.\nUtilization of Technology: Technology must be used to connect the dots in the health system. Medical devices in hospitals and clinics, mobile health apps, wearables, and sensors are just a few examples of technology that should be considered.\nImproving Mental Health Care Services: Increasing financing for mental health services, educating healthcare professionals on how to effectively treat mental health issues, and lowering the stigma attached to mental illness are all part of improving mental health services.\nAddressing the Root Causes of Health Disparities: To address the social determinants of health and reduce overall health inequities, the healthcare system should collaborate with other sectors, such as education, housing, and sanitation.\nSustainable Health governance: To promote more effective and efficient healthcare services, sustainable health governance may involve implementing better management systems, bolstering healthcare regulatory organisations, and developing independent oversight mechanisms.\nMake Public Awareness: People should be made aware of the value of early detection and prevention. It would also help them save money on out-of-pocket expenses.\nOne Health Approach: The need for communal health programmes that address a healthy environment, healthy animals, and healthy people is urgent. This is known as the \u201cone health approach,\u201d and it aims to address these connections between human and animal health.\n\nAlso read: Medical Device Sector in India\n\nMajor Steps Taken by the Government\n\nDespite the fact that health is a state issue, the Central Government assists state governments in providing health services through a variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary care systems.\n\nIn the Union Budget 2023-24:\n\nRs. 89,155 crore was allocated to the health sector, an increase of over 13% from the previous budget.\nAllocated Rs. 6835 crore for establishing 22 new \u00a0All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).\nAdditionally, the National Health Mission\u2019s budget allocation increased from Rs. 28,974 crore in the preceding years to Rs. 29,085 crore in the current 2023\u201324 budget.\nBudgetary support for the National Digital Health Mission increased from the previous year\u2019s Rs. 140 crore to the current Rs. 341 crore.\nThe funds allotted for autonomous bodies were also scaled up, going from Rs. 10,348 crore in the previous budgeted allocation to Rs. 17,322 crore at the moment.\n\nIn order to promote medical tourism in the country, the government of India is extending the e-medical visa facility to the citizens of 156 countries.\n\nPrime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi introduced the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission in September 2021. The endeavour will link the digital health solutions of hospitals across the country. Every citizen will now have access to a digital health ID, and their medical records will be safeguarded online.\n\nIn July 2021, the Ministry of Tourism established the \u2018National Medical & Wellness Tourism Board\u2019 to promote medical and wellness tourism in India.\n\nIn July 2021, the Union Cabinet approved the continuation of the National Ayush Mission, responsible for the development of traditional medicines in India, as a centrally sponsored scheme until 2026.\n\nIn July 2021, the Union Cabinet approved the MoU between India and Denmark on cooperation in health and medicine. The agreement will focus on joint initiatives and technology development in the health sector, with the aim of improving public health status of the population of both countries.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia is a land full of opportunities for Health Care and Services. Along with being one of the top places for high-end diagnostic services, the nation has made significant capital investments in advanced diagnostic facilities to serve a larger proportion of the population.\n\nFuture demand for healthcare services is anticipated to increase due to factors such as advancing income levels, an ageing population, rising health awareness, and shifting attitudes toward preventative healthcare.\n\nA comprehensive strategy is required to address issues in India\u2019s healthcare industry. This necessitates active collaboration between all stakeholders, including the public, private, and individual sectors.\n\nIn 2023, India\u2019s approach to social determinants of health (SDH) could be consolidated and expanded. As a major economic pillar, India must now maintain its existing interest in strategic health policy.\n\nRead:\u00a0\n\nClimate Resilient Health\u00a0Systems\nViolence against healthcare workers (VAHCW) in India\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S",

What are Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLP)? What is its focus? How is it designed? Read further to read about Multi Modal Logistics Parks.\n\nA government program called Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) aims to create these parks throughout the nation\u2019s many logistics hubs.\n\nThe National Highways Authority of India and National Highways Logistics Management Limited, both part of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), are in charge of the initiative (NHAI).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMulti-Modal Logistics Park\nAbout Multi-Modal Logistics Park\nFocus of MMLP\nDesign of Multi-Modal Logistics Parks\nA tripartite agreement under Bharatmala Pariyojna\nMMLP advantages\nNeed for \u00a0the MMLPs\nConclusion\nMulti-Modal Logistics Park\n\nThe upgraded version of a logistics park, MMLP offers a variety of value-added services in addition to rail and road transportation. Nowadays, supply management is a widely recognised concept that goes by various names across the globe. India has never before had a comprehensive strategy for creating logistic parks.\n\nThe MMLPs was designed to provide several capabilities, including freight gathering and distribution, and to provide seamless intermodal freight transportation. Users will also receive value-added services including custom clearances and IT services, as well as storage and warehousing solutions.\n\nAbout Multi-Modal Logistics Park\n\nThe MMLP will combine several types of freight transportation through highways, railroads, and inland waterways. It was developed using a \u201cHub and Spoke\u201d paradigm. To enhance the nation\u2019s freight logistics industry, these MMLPs will be created using a hub-and-spoke network, which connects every location through a single intermediary point known as a hub.\n\nThe development of the MMLP is anticipated to have a major positive impact on the transportation industry. These include decreased warehousing expenses, decreased traffic congestion and pollution, improved tracking and traceability of transit shipments, and lower overall freight prices.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThrough interventions in infrastructure, procedures, and information technology, all of these are feasible in various ways. The MMLPs also offer auxiliary services including storage, warehousing options, value-added services like custom clearances, and IT services.\n\nA one-stop shop for all services linked to cargo movement, such as warehousing, customs clearance, parking, truck repair, etc., the Multi-Modal Logistic Park project is prepared to construct cutting-edge large-scale warehouse facilities for all types of commodities.\n\nIt will feature all the necessary amenities, including warehouses, rail sidings, cold storage, a customs clearing house, yard space, workshops, gas stations, truck parking, office space, boarding houses, restaurants, a water treatment facility, etc.\n\nFocus of MMLP\n\nThe MMLPs\u2019 deployment of a cutting-edge freight management system will be driven by technology. These projects will include many value-added services, including packaging, repackaging, and labelling. Along with other related facilities, MMLP will be a freight-handling facility for automated material handling and value-added services.\n\nDesign of Multi-Modal Logistics Parks\nIn October 2017, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) gave MoRT&H permission to build 35 Multi-Model Logistics Parks (MMLP) across the nation. These 35 MMLPs, which are being implemented by MoRTH, will be made using the Design, Build, Finance, Operate, and Transfer (DBFOT) model of Public Private Partnership (PPP).\nThe majority of the projected MMPLs will be built through public-private partnerships (PPPs), according to the National Highways and Logistics Management (NHLML), an SPV that is completely owned by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The funding strategy for the parks will be 50:50.\nA total of 35 multi-modal logistics parks with a capital budget of Rs 50,000 crore are planned for the country. The 35 MMLPs being planned are at North Gujarat, Jaipur, Kolkata, Ambala, Jagatsinghpur, Nashik, Kota, Panaji, Hisar, Visakhapatnam, Bhopal, Sundargarh, Bhatinda, Solan, Rajkot, Raipur, Jammu, Kandla, Cochin, Delhi-NCR, Bangalore, Indore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Coimbatore, Pune, Surat, Sangrur, and Delhi-NCR.\n\nFor the quick creation of contemporary Multi Modal Logistics Parks (MMLP), the Government of India recently signed a tripartite agreement under Bharatmala Pariyojna.\n\nA tripartite agreement under Bharatmala Pariyojna\n\nThe goal is to consolidate freight centrally and lower logistics spending from 14% of GDP to less than 10%, in line with international standards.\n\nThe Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), National Highways Logistics Management Limited (NHLML), and Rail Vikas Nigam Limited inked the trilateral agreement.\nIt is a 100% publicly owned company that reports to the Ministry of Railways.\nThe agreement highlights the three organisations\u2019 concepts of collaboration and cooperation for achieving efficiency in domestic logistics movement.\nBy ensuring that cargo is switched/shifted from and to waterways, dedicated freight corridors, and road transport, it will provide a seamless modal shift.\nMMLP advantages\nThe government hopes to lower logistic expenditures from the present 14\u201316% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) to roughly 9% with the 53 MMLPs that are planned overall.\nAdditionally, it believes that these mega logistic parks would result in the development of manufacturing or assembly clusters close to these facilities, which will significantly reduce the expense and duration of freight transportation.\nThe programme also emphasises on the effectiveness of freight and passenger transportation across the nation by filling up important infrastructure gaps with practical solutions like economic corridors and multi-modal integration using roads, logistic parks, ports, and ropeways among others.\nIn addition to offering effective trans-shipment and processing facilities, the series of MMLPs has a complete plan in place to meet every aspect of the logistics industry.\nNeed for \u00a0the MMLPs\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) claims that India\u2019s logistics industry is less efficient and more expensive than that of other nations. As a result, the economy\u2019s general efficiency has decreased, and the cost structure of all commodities has climbed.\n\nRoad freights are more expensive in India than in other nations, yet freight vehicle average speeds are around 50% to 60% slower. According to the ADB, the following variables have a negative impact on freight movement in India.\nA skewed mix of modes of transportation. 60% of freight in India is transported by road, which is a much higher percentage than in many other economies. Inland rivers and coastal transport are still in their infancy\nDespite being 45% less expensive per ton-km than roads, rail transportation is only negligible because of unfair pricing and rake booking practises, as well as a lack of intermodal infrastructure to facilitate the simple transfer.\nInfrastructure for material handling is underdeveloped. Due to the prevalence of several tiny, private, disorganised warehouses that offer little to no value-added services, the warehousing environment is very disorganised.\nIn contrast to more efficient line haul freight, more point-to-point freight movement on smaller trucks occurs when logistical hubs are not present to serve as zones for freight consolidation and disaggregation.\nIneffective and outdated service model.\nEfficiency is also hampered by the fact that many businesses compete on the basis of hiring low-skilled labour at low salaries, forgoing investments in information technology and equipment technology, and thereby giving up productivity increases and service quality.\nThe institutional and governmental structure is fragmented. Different ministries presently oversee various facets of the logistics value chain. Leading nations with efficient logistics, including Malaysia, Germany, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, adopt a fully integrated approach to logistics, and the government coordinates control of the entire logistical value chain.\nConclusion\n\nCosts associated with logistics are now more precise than they were before the deregulation of diesel pricing. Numerous programs, like Bharatmala and Sagarmala, aim to enhance the nation\u2019s logistics industry. Creating specialized freight corridors, such as the east-west and north-south Dedicated Freight Corridors. GST implementation, which resulted in a decrease in regulatory compliance.\n\nThis would guarantee a change in the location of the warehouse facilities and lower the cost of transportation. The manufacturing industry, which is heavily dependent on transportation, is the focus of the Make-in-India initiative.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe three basic methods of disinvestment are:\n\nmajority disinvestment\ncomplete privatization\nminority disinvestment\n\nWhen minority disinvestment takes effect, the government keeps a majority stake in the business (typically more than 51%) ensuring managerial control.\n\nIn the case of a majority divestiture, the government transfers control to the acquiring corporation while holding onto a portion of the company, whereas, in the case of a complete privatization, the buyer receives complete ownership of the business.\n\nThe main goal of disinvestment is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) related to capital goods, labor, and infrastructure, regardless of whether this entails divestiture or a reduction in funding.\n\nDisinvestment is carried out for a variety of reasons, such as strategic, political, or environmental.\n\nMeans of Disinvestment\n\nDisinvestment of a minority stake in a government-owned entity is done in one of the following ways:\n\nInitial Public Offering (IPO)\nFollow On Public Offer (FPO)\nOffer For Sale (OFS)\nInstitutional Placement: Government stake is auctioned off to select financial institutions\nExchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Monetize shareholding simultaneously across multiple sectors and companies that form a constituent of the ETF.\nCross-holding: Listed PSUs are allowed to buy a government stake in another PSU\nDisinvestment in India\n\nIn India, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) deals with all matters relating to the management of Central Government investments in equity including disinvestment of equity in Central Public Sector Undertakings.\n\nThe Department of Disinvestment was set up as a separate Department in 1999 and was later renamed as Ministry of Disinvestment in 2001.\nSince 2004, the Department of Disinvestment falls under the Ministry of Finance.\nThe Department of Disinvestment was renamed as Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) in 2016.\n\nThe four major areas of its work related to:\n\nStrategic Disinvestment\nMinority Stake Sales\nAsset Monetisation\nCapital Restructuring\n\nIt also deals with all matters relating to the sale of Central Government equity through an offer for sale private placement or any other mode in the erstwhile Central Public Sector Undertakings.\n\nDIPAM is working as one of the Departments under the Ministry of Finance.\n\nAlso read: Privatisation of Air India \u2013 Should India\u2019s Public Sector Airline be

Disinvestment along with transfer of management control.\n\nStrategic disinvestment of CPSEs lies at the heart of the disinvestment policy.\nStrategic disinvestment would imply the sale of a substantial portion of the Government shareholding of a central public sector enterprise (CPSE) of up to 50% or such higher percentage as the competent authority may determine, along with transfer of management control.\nMinority stake sales\n\nMinority Stake Sale happens when the Government intends to sell a part of the PSU from its overall shareholding, given that post-stake sale the GOI ownership is still above 51%.\n\nPost the sale control over management is retained by the Government of India.\nHistorically, Minority Stake Sales have been auctioned off to institutions or offloaded to the public by means of an Offer for Sale.\nPresently, government policy states that all disinvestments would only be minority disinvestments via Public Offers.\n\nAs per the present Allocation of Business Rules, the mandate of the DIPAM is as follows:\n\nAll matters relating to the management of Central Government investments in equity including disinvestment of equity in Central Public Sector Undertakings.\nAll matters relating to the sale of Central Government equity through offer for sale or private placement or any other mode in the erstwhile Central Public Sector Undertakings.\nDecisions on the recommendations of Administrative Ministries, NITI Aayog, etc. for disinvestment including strategic disinvestment.\nAll matters related to Independent External Monitor

management of public investment in CPSEs for accelerating economic development and augmenting the Government\u2019s resources for higher expenditure\n\nMission includes:\n\nList CPSEs on stock exchanges to promote people\u2019s ownership through public participation and improve efficiencies of CPSEs through accountability to its shareholders.\nTo bring operational efficiencies in CPSEs through strategic investment, ensuring their greater contribution to the economy.\nAdopt a professional approach for the financial management of CPSEs in the national interest and investment aimed at expanding public participation in ownership of CPSEs.\nNational Investment Fund (NIF)\n\nThe government had constituted the National Investment Fund (NIF) in November 2005 into which the proceeds from the disinvestment of Central Public Sector Enterprises were to be channelized.\n\nThe corpus of NIF was to be of a permanent nature and NIF was to be professionally managed to provide sustainable returns to the Government, without depleting the corpus.\n\nSelected Public Sector Mutual Funds, namely UTI Asset Management Company Ltd., SBI Funds Management Private Ltd., and LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Company Ltd. were entrusted with the management of the NIF corpus.\n\nAs per this Scheme, 75% of the annual income of the NIF was to be used for financing selected social sector schemes that promote education, health, and employment.\nThe residual 25% of the annual income of NIF was to be used to meet the capital investment requirements of profitable and revivable PSUs.\nDisinvestment Plan 2023-24\nThe list of CPSEs to be divested in 2023\u20132024 will not be expanded by the Center with any more enterprises.\nThe government has chosen to proceed with the privatization of State-owned enterprises which was previously stated and planned.\nThe Container Corporation of India Ltd. (Concor), NMDC Steel Ltd., BEML, HLL Lifecare, and IDBI Bank are a few examples.\nInterestingly, the government had approved the disinvestments of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, SCI, and ConCor in 2019, but they have not yet taken place.\nAdvantages of disinvestment\nThe government may reduce spending or make up for a year\u2019s worth of lost revenue by disinvesting.\nDisinvestment also promotes open market trading and private asset ownership.\nAs private sector ownership and management can introduce new ideas and a more market-oriented attitude, the government can increase the efficiency and competitiveness of these businesses by divesting from public sector corporations.\nThe government can reallocate the funds made available by disinvestment to support other objectives like infrastructure and social advancement.\nSince private ownership and management can result in more rigorous financial and operational reporting, disinvestment can increase openness and accountability in the operation of public sector firms.\nChallenges\nPolitical parties and labor organizations who oppose the sale of public sector firms have frequently resisted disinvestment, which is a contentious subject in India.\nBecause of their bureaucratic and non-market-oriented architecture, public sector businesses may not be able to compete successfully in the market, making their valuation a difficult task.\nDisinvestment can also result in labor-related problems because employees of public sector businesses may worry about losing their jobs or seeing their pay decrease once these businesses are sold.\nIn some instances, the government may have trouble selling its holdings in public sector companies, particularly if they are not doing well financially.\nA number of rules and approval procedures must be followed during the disinvestment process, which can cause delays and increase complexity.\nAs litigants may contest the legality of the transaction or the terms and conditions under which it was performed, the process of disinvestment may also be contested in court.\nConclusion\n\nDisinvestment is regarded as a crucial instrument for fostering economic development and prosperity in India.\n\nThe goal of the Indian government\u2019s disinvestment policy is to increase revenue, boost public sector enterprise productivity, encourage economic growth, and contribute to the development of a more vibrant and sustainable economy.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

It is found in the study that the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) technique is significant in terms of water saving, input costs, plant growth, and other social impacts.\n\nSRI was first introduced in the 1980s in Madagascar by Father de Laulani\u00e9 then its potential went under testing in India as well along with several other countries. Father de Laulani\u00e9 observed that SRI is an amalgamation of multiple beneficial practices.\n\nSRI is not a standardized technique, instead, it is a set of ideas that helps in reducing resource waste and increases productivity using land, seed, water, nutrients, and human labor.\n\nTechnique of System of Rice Intensification\n\nThe Rice Intensification technique for cultivation involves the use of as much organic manure as possible, planting young seedlings in a square pattern at wide spacing, and irrigation intermittently with irrigation that keeps the soil moist but not swamped.\n\nHow Rice Intensification is Beneficial for India?\n\nAs we know, Agriculture plays a vital role in the Indian economy, and the average land-holding size in India is 1.08 hectares. Out of which, the average land holding of marginal farmers (Which constitute around 65% of total farmers in India), is less than one acre (0.4 hectares).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe above data clearly indicates that India constitutes a large number of small and marginal farmers.\n\nIt is beneficial in the context of India because:\n\nSRI paddy cultivation requires less quantity of seed per hectare. Mainstream paddy cultivation requires 20 kg of seed per acre but the System of Rice Intensification requires just 2 kg of seed per acre.\nThe requirement of seed comes down as the seed is sown in a square pattern at wider spacing. In the traditional method of cultivation, it requires approx 792,000 no. of plants per acre which will come down to 64,000 only in the System of Rice Intensification.\nThe area under rice cultivation has increased over the year but paddy is a water-intensive field that restricted its growth to several areas of the country and discourages its growth in less irrigated or not properly irrigated areas. SRI requires 15 to 20% less water for paddy production. So, SRI makes it viable for more areas to get indulge in rice cultivation.\nThis makes SRI cost-effective and most sustainable for small and marginal farmers.\nAdvantages of System of Rice Intensification\n\nSRI has several advantages:\n\nIt requires more organic manure, so dependency on chemicals will reduce, and due to lesser use of chemicals farmers\u2019 health will also improve.\nSoil health will also increase with time through biological activity.\nSRI provides Higher yield production of rice.\nMaturity time will be reduced by 10 days.\nLess water is required for SRI. Approx 15 to 20% of the water will be saved.\nit is less capital oriented so it will increase the income security of farmers.\nGrain weight increased without a change in grain size.\nDecreases dependency on chemical fertilizers and pesticides.\nResists insects because it allows rice to absorb soil nutrients naturally.\nThe SRI technique will help in the improvement of the food security of the country.\nDisadvantages of System of Rice Intensification\n\nThe technique of System of Rice Intensification (SRI) has several disadvantages:\n\nSRI is initially more labor-intensive.\nIt requires 50% more man-days for transplanting and weeding.\nInitially, it is difficult to acquire the necessary skills to master SRI.\nRequires some amount of irrigation, so it is not suitable for no irrigation areas.\nComparison Between Traditional Method and SRI\nIn the SRI technique, 22.34% more yield of rice is witnessed as compared to the traditional methods/other methods.\nNet total return per acre is higher in SRI as compared to other methods.\n15-20% less water is used during the production process.\nRice Cultivation in India\n\nRice is a Kharif crop and is a staple food of India. Over half of the world\u2019s population i.e, over 3 billion people consume rice every day.\n\nIndia is the second-largest producer and the largest exporter of rice.\n\nIn India, West Bengal is the largest producer of Rice followed by Uttar Pradesh.\n\nRice- Favourable Climatic Conditions\nIn India, rice is cultivated in a wide range of climatic conditions and at various altitudes.\nA hot and humid climate with an extended period of sunshine and water supply.\nThe growth pattern and yield of rice crops are all significantly influenced by temperature.\nIt requires an average temperature of 21 to 37 degrees Celsius.\nAlong with that, it requires an annual rainfall of between 150 to 300 cm.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Ever since its issuance, the Green Bond Market experienced an insane spike.\n\nGreen Bonds continue to be the most prevalent of the sustainability, social, and green bond-set among issuers worldwide.\nSocial bonds were displaced by sustainability bonds as the second most common type of bond issued this year in terms of dollars.\n\nCompanies, nations, and international organizations all offer green bonds, which guarantee fixed-income payments to investors while only funding initiatives that benefit the environment or the climate.\n\nThe initiatives could involve, among other things, green buildings, sustainable transportation, and renewable energy.\nThese bonds\u2019 earnings are designated for environmental projects. This is different from regular bonds, which allow the issuer to use the proceeds for a variety of things.\nWhat distinguishes green bonds from conventional bonds?\nThe revenues of regular bonds may be used for a variety of reasons at the issuer\u2019s discretion, whereas the proceeds of green bonds may only be used for environmental projects.\nGreen bond issuers are also required to provide details about the project they seek to fund, as well as any anticipated effects on the environment and the climate.\n\nAlso read: Electoral Bond Scheme\n\nSovereign Green Bonds Framework of India\n\nThe Framework closely follows India\u2019s \u201cPanchamrit\u201d pledges at the Conference of Parties (COP) 26 in Glasgow in November 2021.\n\nThrough this India\u2019s dedication to its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets, set forth under the Paris Agreement, would be further strengthened.\n\nTo approve important choices for the issuing of Sovereign Green Bonds, the Green Finance Working Committee (GFWC) was established.\n\nThe framework has received a \u201cGood\u201d governance score and a \u201cMedium Green\u201d rating from the independent second opinion provider CICERO in Norway.\n\nThe project or solution is given the \u201cMedium Green\u201d classification if it \u201crepresents important progress towards the long-term objective, but is not quite there yet.\u201d\n\nThe government said the green bonds\u2019 proceeds would be used for green projects that-\n\nEncourage energy efficiency\nReduce carbon emissions and greenhouse gases\nPromote climate resilience and adaptation\nImprove natural ecosystems and biodiversity, especially by the principles of sustainable development goals.\n\nThe framework listed investments in solar, wind, biomass, and hydro energy projects, urban mass transportation projects such as metro rail, green buildings, pollution prevention, and control projects.\n\nAll fossil fuel-related projects have been kept out of the framework, along with biomass-based renewable energy projects that rely on feedstock from protected areas.\nThe government also excluded projects such as nuclear power generation, and direct waste incineration.\n\nThe eligible expenditure is limited to government spending that occurred not more than 12 months before issuance.\n\nThe proceeds should be allocated to projects within 24 months of issuing the bonds.\nIf an eligible green project is postponed or canceled, it will be replaced by another eligible green project.\nBenefits of sovereign green bonds\n\nGovernments and authorities are sent a strong signal of intent about climate change and sustainable development by sovereign green issuance.\n\nIt will spur the growth of the local market and provide institutional investors with a boost.\nIt will facilitate the expansion of a local market by offering benchmark pricing, liquidity, and a demonstration effect for local issuers.\nSovereign issuance can help jump-start these significant capital inflows, with the IEA\u2019s World Energy Outlook 2021 projecting that 70% of the additional USD 4 trillion spending to reach net zero is necessary for emerging/developing nations.\n\nBenefits for investors are also manifold:\n\nDepending on the issuer and the location, tax incentives may include tax credits and tax exemptions.\nFacilitating direct investment in initiatives to enhance society and greening brown industries\nIncreased accountability and transparency regarding the use and management of income, which led to the creation of a new risk management instrument\nComparable financial gains plus benefits to society or the environment\nInvestors in Green Bonds would thereby gain additional tax advantages in addition to investment security.\nChallenges\n\nMaintaining liquidity and enabling trade in these bonds is the first challenge.\n\nAccording to the RBI, statutory liquidity ratio and repo transactions will be open to green bonds. These actions will support the preservation of liquidity and facilitate the trading of these bonds.\nTo assure liquidity, twin bonds can also be issued, as Denmark did. Two comparable and interchangeable bonds are issued under this arrangement, allowing investors to move between them and promoting increased trade and liquidity.\nBased on the twin bond strategy, the government and RBI previously issued market stabilization bonds.\n\nThe interest rate on these bonds is the second issue.\n\nWill investors pay more or less for green bonds of comparable maturity compared to regular bonds?\nMarket participants refer to the price differential between green bonds and regular bonds as \u201cgreenium.\u201d\nResearch by US Federal Reserve economists shows that corporate green bonds have a yield spread that is 8 basis points lower relative to conventional bonds.\nBefore investing, investors will require additional details about the green projects.\nGiven that investors will initially be unsure about factors like liquidity and tradability, there may initially be a \u201cgreen discount.\u201d\n\nThe third challenge is to make sure that green bonds continue to be a component of the budget and the broader borrowing program.\n\nSuch thematic bonds are frequently employed by the government off the balance sheet, which causes the total borrowings and deficits to be underestimated.\n\nAlso, investors worry about greenwashing as well.\n\nInvestors want to be sure that their resources are being allocated to projects that make a difference and have positive impacts.\nIn addition, financial factors such as macroeconomic outlook, credit profile, and political risks are relevant for investors when evaluating thematic bonds.\nSovereigns should take these factors into account when planning such green bond issuances.\nWay forward\n\nInterest in sovereign green bonds from countries and investors is growing. Considering the potential of this market, the World Bank surveyed emerging market trends and international investors to understand the prospects for such transactions which reiterated the trend.\n\nChallenges related to establishing governance arrangements to manage and track proceeds, knowledge of international standards and investor expectations, and the limited pool of eligible projects constrain the supply of emerging market sovereign thematic bonds.\n\nThe need for sovereigns to issue green bonds remains because of significant funding needs to implement actions related to climate, environment, and SDGs, yet challenges must be addressed.\n\nUnlocking the potential for sovereign thematic bonds in emerging and developing markets can only be achieved by clarifying market expectations and overcoming the knowledge gap.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Social Impact Bonds\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

India\u2019s finished steel consumption is anticipated to increase manifold in 2030-31. Read here to know the history and growth of the steel industry in India.\n\nMetal consumption has been one of the main driving causes behind industrialization.\n\nSteel has long held the top position among metals. Steel is both a raw material and an intermediary product, therefore its production and consumption are commonly used as indicators of a nation\u2019s economic success.\n\nTherefore, it would not be overstating the case to say that the steel industry is the backbone of any economy and has always been at the forefront of industrial advancement.\n\nThe steel industry in India is divided into three groups: primary producers, secondary producers, and large producers.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of the Steel industry in India\nIndian Steel Industry after independence\nSteel Industry in India\nChallenges\nGovernment initiatives for the steel sector\nRecent developments\nWay forward\nHistory of the Steel industry in India\n\nIndia was one of the first countries to practice manufacturing metals, as early as 1600 BCE.

The first mention of iron use in India that was written in the West was by the Greek historian Herodotus (431\u2013425 BCE).\n\nHowever, the Iron and Steel industry did not establish its foundation in India until the year 1907.\n\nIn the early 1800s, efforts were launched in earnest to construct iron and steel production facilities.\n\nThe first attempt, made in 1808 by Mr. Duncan of the East India Company, failed miserably.\nJosiah Marshall Heath launched a second attempt in 1830 when he built the world\u2019s first iron and steel facility in Porto Novo, Madras. However, this plant was unable to succeed and was closed in 1860.\n\nThe Bengal Iron Company Ltd was established in 1926 and took over the Bengal Iron Works established in 1870. The company with the usage of better iron ore saw the first profits in the industry.\n\nJamsedji Nusserwanji Tata founded the modern-day Tata Steel, formerly known as TISCO, in Jamshedpur in the year 1907.\n\nTISCO was running the largest steel mill in the entire British Empire by 1939.\nCurrently, this corporation ranks as the seventh-largest steel manufacturer in the world and the top iron and steel producer in India.\nThe IISCO plant was set up in 1919 at Burnpur and in 1930 the Bengal Iron Company merged with IISCO.\n\nAlso read: Superconductivity\n\nIndian Steel Industry after independence\n\nPost-Independence India\u2019s steel industry has flourished tremendously. India produced an estimated 16.9 lakh tonnes of pig iron between 1950 and 1951.\n\nThe three major actors in the private sector under the first plan for iron and steel in India were TISCO, IISCO, and Mysore State Iron and Steel Works.\n\nThe Hindustan Steel Limited (HSL), a government-owned company, set up 3 plants in 1950. This company came into being through the efforts of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nHindustan Steel Limited was set up on January 19, 1954.\nHindustan Steel (HSL) was initially designed to manage only one plant that was coming up at Rourkela.\n\nHSL comprised four plants:\n\nBhilai Steel Plant\nRourkela Steel Plant\nDurgapur Steel Plant\nAlloy Steel Plant\n\nThe Steel Authority of India (SAIL) was launched in the year 1973. It is a government organization that manages all the major steel plants in India like Bhilai, Bokara, Rourkela, and Burnpur. This organization started managing Iron and Steel in 1976.\n\nThe Ministry of Steel and Mines drafted a policy statement to evolve a new model for managing industry in 1972.\nOn this basis, the concept of creating a holding company to manage inputs and outputs under one umbrella was mooted. This led to the formation of the Steel Authority of India Ltd.\nThe company, incorporated on January 24, 1973, was made responsible for managing five integrated steel plants at Bhilai, Bokaro, Durgapur, Rourkela, and Burnpur, the Alloy Steel Plant, and the Salem Steel Plant.\nIn 1978 SAIL was restructured as an operating company.\n\nThe growth in the Indian steel sector has been driven by the domestic availability of raw materials such as iron ore and cost-effective labor. Consequently, the steel sector has been a major contributor to India\u2019s manufacturing output.\n\nSteel Industry in India\nCourtesy: Maps of India\n\nIn the past 10\u201312 years, India\u2019s steel sector has expanded significantly. Production has increased by 75% since 2008, while domestic steel demand has increased by almost 80%. The capacity for producing steel has grown concurrently, and the rise has been largely organic.\n\nIndia is home to the fifth-highest reserves of iron ore in the world.\nAs of April 2022, India was the world\u2019s second-largest producer of crude steel.\nIn FY22, India\u2019s export rose by 25.1%, compared with 2021.\n\nThe steel industry and its associated mining and metallurgy sectors have seen major investments and developments in the recent past.\n\nIndia was the largest producer of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) or Sponge Iron in the world in 2021.\nIndia is the 2nd largest consumer of finished steel preceded by China as the largest steel consumer as per the World Steel Association.\n\nIn September 2022, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), a Maharatna PSU, supplied 30,000 tonnes of the entire DMR grade specialty steel for the nation\u2019s first indigenously built Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe secondary steel sector in India currently contributes over 40% of the total capacity and it will need to play a crucial role for India to reach 300 MT capacity.\n\nThe need is to identify challenges to capacity expansion in the country with a special focus on secondary steel and to correspondingly discuss suggestions on alleviating these.\n\nDespite being the 3rd largest steel consumer in the world, India has per capita steel consumption that is only one-third of the world\u2019s average.\nLow per capita consumption due to overall poverty compared to the world average decreases the incentive to set up huge plants to take advantage of economies of scale.\nDespite being a small share of imports by quantity, alloy, and stainless steel contribute disproportionately to the import bill by value.\nFew Indian entities can establish large factories to benefit from economies of scale utilizing the equity route because of their limited resources due to low per capita incomes. As a result, the majority of factories rely on borrowing and debt finance.\nIndia invests significantly less than the rest of the world in technology, research, and development. The same holds for the production and consumption of steel, as it has for many years.\nThe technology utilized in India up until recently needed a lot of power, was very dirty, and used a lot of water.\nIndia is at a disadvantage when it comes to producing steel the way it wants to due to a lack of electricity. With the correct balance of thermal and renewable energy, there might be some relief.\nFor every tonne of iron ore extracted, there is a lot less coal available, necessitating coal imports to maintain captive power plants. India receives coal primarily from Australia and Indonesia. Australia has been increasing its coal costs, which has a direct impact on the cost of iron and steel in India.\nGovernment initiatives for the steel sector\n\nSome of the recent Government initiatives in this sector are:\n\nNational Steel Policy (NSP) 2017: The new Steel Policy enshrines the long-term vision of the Government to give impetus to the steel sector.\n\nIt seeks to enhance domestic steel consumption and ensure high-quality steel production and create a technologically advanced and globally competitive steel industry.\nThe policy also envisages domestically meeting the entire demand for high-grade automotive steel, electrical steel, special steels, and alloys for strategic applications and increasing domestic availability of washed coking coal to reduce import dependence on coking coal from about 85% to around 65% by 2030-31.\n\nThe Government has also announced a policy for providing preference to domestically manufactured Iron & Steel products in Government procurement.\n\nThe government has also approved a Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Specialty Steel. It is expected that specialty steel production will become 42 million tonnes by the end of 2026-27.\nThe Ministry of Steel is facilitating the setting up of an industry-driven Steel Research and Technology Mission of India (SRTMI) in association with the public and private sector steel companies to spearhead research and development activities in the iron and steel industry.\nThe Government of India raised import duty on most steel items twice, each time by 2.5%, and imposed measures including anti-dumping and safeguard duties on iron and steel items.\nRecent developments\n\nIndia\u2019s 1st Green Hydrogen Plant in the Stainless Steel Sector, located at Jindal Stainless Limited, Hisar was inaugurated in March 2024.\n\nIt will be the\u00a0world\u2019s first off-grid Green Hydrogen plant\u00a0for the\u00a0stainless steel industry\u00a0and the\u00a0world\u2019s first Green Hydrogen plant\u00a0with\u00a0rooftop & floating solar.\nThis project is also a state-of-the-art green hydrogen facility with a target to reduce carbon emissions considerably by around\u00a02,700 Metric Tonnes per annum\u00a0and\u00a054,000 tons of CO2 emissions over the next two decades.\nWay forward\n\nGiven the importance of a wide range of sectors on steel production as India strives to become a manufacturing powerhouse through governmental initiatives like Make in India, the steel industry in India has emerged as a key emphasis area.\n\nIndia ranks as the world\u2019s second-largest producer of steel and is on track to surpass China as the world\u2019s second-largest consumer of steel, with the sector contributing around 2% of the country\u2019s GDP.\n\nIndia continues to employ concrete in the majority of its structures, despite its enormous population and several incentives to experiment with different methods.\n\nSteel is used far more frequently to construct columns and buildings in the West, the Gulf, and other settled areas.\nUsing steel van produce higher skyscrapers, requires considerably less time to assemble, requires much less maintenance, and helps lower the weight of projects.\nThere are numerous examples, including the Empire State Building in New York, the Taipei 101 Tower in Taiwan, the U.S. Steel Tower in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Shun Hing Square Tower in Shenzhen, China, and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is the most well-known of them all.\n\nIndia\u2019s export production capability and industry both have the potential to aid the country in regaining a favorable steel trade balance.\n\nIndia\u2019s relatively low per capita steel consumption and the anticipated increase in demand due to rising infrastructure construction and the flourishing automobile and railroad sectors present enormous growth potential.\n\nRead:\u00a0Green steel\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

What are the difficulties of charging agricultural Income Taxation in India? Read further to know more.\n\nNearly all nations, especially developing ones where agriculture is still a large industry and provides employment and a means of subsistence for a sizable portion of the population.\n\nIn India, agriculture is regarded to be the Country\u2019s main occupation. India\u2019s sizable rural population frequently serves as their sole source of income. For its basic food needs, the nation as a whole is totally dependent on agriculture. The government has implemented several programs, laws, and other steps to encourage expansion in this industry.\n\nUntil now, governments have resisted efforts to impose taxes on farmers\u2019 income.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCurrent status\nWhy Should Agriculture Income be Taxed?\nRecommendations to Tax Agricultural Income\nDifficulty in Taxing Agriculture Income\nProposal to Raise Agriculture Tax\nWay Forward\nConclusion\nCurrent status\n\nAgricultural income is not taxable under Section 10 (1) of the Income Tax Act since it is not included in a person\u2019s total income. However, if agricultural revenue surpasses Rs.5,000 per year, the state government may levy a tax on it. It is classified as a legal source of income and essentially refers to revenue from sources including commercial agricultural produce, structures on or connected to the agricultural property, and agricultural land itself.\n\nWhether or not agricultural income should be taxed is a matter of debate and can depend on a variety of factors such as the size and profitability of the farm, government policies and economic conditions.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSome argue that taxing agricultural income could discourage small farmers and lead to a concentration of ownership, while others argue that it would create a more level playing field for businesses and generate revenue for government programs.\n\nUltimately, the decision on whether or not to tax agricultural income is typically made by the government and can be influenced by various factors.\n\nWhy Should Agriculture Income be Taxed?\nEven in the 1980s, there was discussion in India about how to properly tax the agricultural industry because many farmers earn more money than non-agriculturalists who pay income tax.\nThe excess produced in the regions where the Green Revolution took place is frittered away on ostentatious expenditure. Therefore, the government must utilize taxation to collect a portion of these surpluses.\nProper taxation of agriculture is required for better land utilization. Progressive taxation of agricultural land or agricultural revenue is anticipated to result in a decline in land values.\nThe numerous agricultural development projects being implemented require a significant financial investment. India\u2019s agriculture has undergone significant modernization, and there is taxable capacity as well as increased output has occurred.\nThere is underutilized taxable capacity in the agricultural industry as a result of improved inter-sectoral terms of trade.\nFarm taxes would encourage financial stability and gradually include more and more areas in the monetized sector.\nJapan derived a significant portion of its industrialization resources from agriculture. China and the Soviet Union also did.\nUtilize resources from this industry to mobilize the supplies needed to hasten the expansion of agricultural output.\nTaxing agricultural income might increase a big portion of farmers\u2019 access to financing because verified income tax returns can give a reliable indication of a farmer\u2019s future earnings.\nSmall and marginal farmers will demand improved services, infrastructure, and facilities if agricultural income is taxed.\nAdditionally, it will provide farmers in this nation a strong incentive to form associations, demand accountability, and try to influence development debates rather than just accept their status as beneficiaries.\nFarmers in the nation will be able to form the habit of saving for their bright future in the years to come if income tax is collected on agricultural income, particularly because the income-tax provision gives tax deductions on specific investments etc.\nRecommendations to Tax Agricultural Income\n\nDr. K.N. Raj presided over the Committee on Agriculture Taxation in 1975. The committee\u2019s recommendation was to tax wealthy individuals\u2019 agricultural revenue.\n\nDr B.D. Ambedkar, a man of imposing personality and profound vision, supported taxing agricultural revenue with his persuasive arguments.\n\nDifficulty in Taxing Agriculture Income\nFamily labour plays a significant role in the revenue-generating process in agriculture, which is typically a sole proprietorship. The issue of depreciation and capital replacement is more difficult to solve.\nLarge annual revenue fluctuations, a lack of monthly periodicity in collections, and the integration of production, transportation, and sale of products make it challenging to develop an agricultural income tax.\nWhen considering taxing agricultural income in light of the rising suicide rate among agriculturalists, some may be concerned that this will lead to an increase in agriculturalist suicides.\nAssessing an Indian farmer\u2019s true income or income-earning potential becomes difficult because a large portion of them are illiterate or semi-literate and do not keep systematic books of accounts regarding their production and income.\nIt is also possible to worry that the imposition of tax will result in credit only going to large farmers because they have more income to demonstrate.\nProposal to Raise Agriculture Tax\n\nTax officials specifically recommended that the government think about taxing agricultural revenue, albeit only partially.\n\nPeople with agricultural income and regular income who earn more than a particular amount can be brought into the tax system.\n\nFix a progressive tax for other farmers and exclude 71% of farmers who have 5 acres or less from land revenue.\n\nAdditionally, the government may not tax agricultural income that is produced from the cultivation of rice, wheat, and vegetables.\n\nLet the government begin collecting agricultural revenue, particularly that of wealthy farmers, and then let it examine the impact, the tax collection, and the issues before coming up with a change to agricultural tax income.\n\nIt is true that taxing agricultural income is a State issue, but just as the Government debated the GST with the States, it is time for it to do the same with taxing agricultural income.\n\nIt is highly believed that if agricultural income is taxed and if the taxation policy is created in a very rational manner, it will not negatively affect the average farmer.\n\nThe government should invest all income-tax proceeds from taxing agricultural revenue towards the expansion of agricultural operations in the first two to three years.\n\nWay Forward\n\nIn order to debate and examine the issues surrounding the taxes on agricultural income in India, it is necessary for all political parties and Chief Ministers to arrange a conclave.\n\nThe focus of the conversation should be on the direction of the country, not on one person\u2019s personal interests or those of a certain political party.\n\nIf there is this kind of debate or discussion in the nation, then policymakers may be able to determine that after decades of agricultural revenue being exempt from taxation, it is now time for agricultural income to be taxed like any other normal income of the taxpayer.\n\nTaxing the product is one solution, which is currently also being done in some States through a mandi tax or another mechanism.\n\nThe consumer will ultimately pay more for the product as a result of this tax being passed forward to them.\n\nBy taking this action, it will be made sure that the tax does not interfere with the farmer\u2019s revenue. In a strict sense, this would be an indirect tax on goods, similar to an excise or sales tax, which will be incorporated into the GST. The farmer\u2019s income will continue to be exempt from income tax.\n\nBefore there is even consideration of including the sector in the income tax net, the procurement policy, price policy, and public distribution system must be taken into account.\n\nDeveloping a technique that considers agricultural income above a particular threshold is necessary.\n\nRegardless of whether one is a farmer, income taxes are required to be paid if one\u2019s income exceeds a certain threshold. Regardless matter whether they are in agriculture, the poor should be exempt.\n\nAlso read: Pulses Production in India; Agriculture export policy\n\nConclusion\n\nRich farmers would be obliged to pay income tax if the government decided to tax agricultural income, which would enhance government revenue, boost the country\u2019s GDP ratio, and ultimately aid in the overall development of the nation.\n\nEvery political party should keep in mind that the nation comes first, not simply vote politics if they truly wish to tax agricultural income in India.\n\nCurrently, farmers in India are exempted from paying income tax to the government. However, if agricultural revenue surpasses Rs.5,000 per year, the state government may levy a tax on it. It is classified as a legal source of income. I think it is a good decision taken by the government to support low-income farmers and reduce their burden of taxation, However, the Government should be ready to levy tax on farmers who earn higher incomes from Agriculture.\n\nFor More Related Notes: Click Here\n\nArticle written by Aryadevi E S",

Read further to know more.\n\nTo achieve the goals of openness & investor friendliness in the business environment of the nation, the Central Government recently modified the regulations related to Nidhi corporations under the Companies Act, 2013, and the Rules.\n\nNidhi firms were founded to encourage members to practise thrift and save money, as well as to accept deposits and lend money to them only for their mutual advantage.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Nidhi Companies?\nRestrictions for Nidhi Company\nNidhi Vs NBFC Vs RBI\nMandatory requirements to form/incorporate a Nidhi company\nGoverning laws:\nNew Amended Rules\nBenefits\nChallenges in India\nConclusion\nWhat are Nidhi Companies?\nA Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) recognised under section 406 of the 2013 Companies Act is the Nidhi Company. It was established to lend and borrow money from its members.\nNidhis are also categorised as Non-Banking Financial Companies because they mostly operate in the unorganised money market.\nThey are also referred to as Mutual Benefit Companies, Benefit Funds, Mutual Benefit Funds, and Permanent Funds. They are governed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, which has the authority to provide them with instructions about their deposit acceptance operations.\nBefore the Corporations Act of 2013, Nidhi already existed. These businesses primarily operate in the southern region of the nation. Tamil Nadu is home to 80% of Nidhi businesses.\nIts name should end with \u201cNidhi Limited\u201d since it is registered as a public business.\nNidhi corporations can only have individual members, and they are not permitted to lend money to other businesses.\nSome examples of Nidhi companies include Maben Nidhi Ltd, Mini Muthoot Nidhi kerala Ltd etc\nRestrictions for Nidhi Company\n\nA Nidhi Company shall not:\n\nConduct chit fund, hire purchase, leasing, insurance, or securities acquisition operations by any body corporate.\nIssue debt instruments or preference shares.\nOpen any current account with its participants.\nAcquire any company by way of purchase of securities or controlling the composition of directors unless approval has been taken from the regional director.\nEngage in any activity other than the name-giving business of borrowing and lending.\nOther than its members, accept deposits from and lend to anyone else.\nAccept deposits from or extend credit to any corporation.\nEngage in any type of cooperation agreement when it comes to borrowing or lending.\nSend out a solicitation for the deposit in an advertisement.\nPay any commission or incentive for obtaining member deposits or for approving loans.\nImpose a fee for the issuance of its shares or only issue up to 10 shares per depositor.\nGrant loans to members who exceed the cap by the 2014 Nidhi guidelines.\nInterest rates that are higher than 7.5 per cent.\nNot declare a dividend that is higher than 25%.\nNidhi Vs NBFC Vs RBI\n\nThe NBFC Company is a business that was created under the Companies Act of 2013 to offer consumers long-term and specialised credit facilities. When it comes to supplying the financial needs of businesses and the less fortunate members of society, NBFC functions much like a bank. Without acquiring an NBFC registration from the RBI, NBFC cannot start its business.\n\nNidhis are under one kind of NBFC, hence RBI has the authority to provide them with instructions on their deposit acceptance activities. However, the RBI has exempted the notified Nidhis from the basic requirements of the RBI Act and other directives applicable to NBFCs in recognition of the fact that these Nidhis only interact with its shareholder-members.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nMandatory requirements to form/incorporate a Nidhi company\nIn contrast to other forms of financial companies like NBFC, which need an RBI licence to launch, Nidhi company registration is less complicated and more straightforward.\nShould have a minimum paid-up capital of Rs. 5 lacs and be a public company.\nwon\u2019t be issuing preference shares.\nShall include \u201cNidhi Limited\u201d in its name as a final word.\nA minimum of three directors must be Nidhi Company members.\n7 shareholders are required.\nGoverning laws:\nThe Nidhi Rules, 2014 govern Nidhi institutions. As a result of its incorporation as a public limited company, they are required to abide by two sets of rules: the Nidhi rules of 2014 and the public limited company requirements under the Companies Act of 2013.\nThe RBI has specifically exempted this category of NBFC in India from complying with its basic provisions, including registration with the RBI, hence no clearance from the RBI is required to register the company.\nEvery Nidhi organisation must make sure that it has 200 members or more within a year of its founding.\nNew Amended Rules\n\nThe government has altered the regulations governing Nidhi enterprises to safeguard the public\u2019s interests, making certain firms\u2019 prior declarations necessary before they begin receiving deposits.\n\nRegistration: The entity must initially register as a public limited company, which has higher disclosure obligations than a private limited company, to become a Nidhi.\nDeclaration: A public company that has a share capital of one million must first apply to the Union government to be recognised as a Nidhi.\nThe Central Government may proclaim a company a Nidhi company in the official gazette after receiving an application from a public corporation that is certain the company has complied with all rules.\nAccording to Section 406 of the revised Firms Act and the Nidhi regulations, Nidhi companies must submit Form NDH-4 requests to the Central Government for updates to their status as Nidhi Companies.\nMembership: This can be accomplished by applying within 120 days of the organization\u2019s creation that demonstrates a minimum membership of 200 and net owned funds of 2 million.\nThe promoters and directors of the company must adhere to the regulations\u2019 definition of a fit and proper person.\nConcept of deemed approval: In other words, approval would be assumed granted if the company does not get word of the application\u2019s outcome within 45 days of applying.\nNo Loans to companies: It is only permitted to have individual members and cannot lend money to businesses.\nBenefits\nVery Easy formation: The process of forming a Nidhi firm is relatively straightforward, and it is considerably less complex than forming an NBFC or another type of financial institution.\nCost-Efficient Registration:\u00a0 The cost of signing up with Nidhi Company is reasonable. You can invest the Rs 5,00,000 lakh required as minimum capital for Nidhi Company registration within two months of registering your Nidhi Company.\nNo RBI Regulations \u2013 less compliance: Nidhi Company is not required to adhere to strict compliances by the RBI.\nMore Certainty in Nidhi company: Everyone in India enjoys saving money, from men in their 60s to toddlers as young as six. Additionally, the company\u2019s major goal is to encourage its members to save regularly, therefore it is certain to remain in business as long as its members continue to do so.\nLess level of Risk \u2013 Non-payment loans:\u00a0 It is the most secure method of loan distribution, and the rates charged on loans to members are extremely cheap when compared to those charged by other lenders, further increasing member savings.\nNet owned fund- Invest one gets twenty: The owner\u2019s capital investment in the company to raise funds is referred to as the net owned fund. You invest one rupee and raise the deposit of twenty, according to the net owned fund ratio of 1:20.\nChallenges in India\nMember specificity: As previously mentioned, Nidhi Companies can only accept deposits from and lend money to its shareholders and members.\nNo outsider can deposit money: This will restrict the amount of money a Nidhi Company can raise. The amount received by Nidhi Companies from their members, if less, restricts the Company\u2019s ability to lend money to its members because Nidhi Companies does not accept deposits from parties other than its members and shareholders.\nlimited lending capacity: If a Nidhi Company\u2019s lending capability is constrained, the entire purpose of the Nidhi Company\u2019s establishment is defeated.\nNo advertisement: Nidhi Companies are prohibited from publicising their depositing plans, unlike other financial institutions. Only among its members are Nidhi Companies permitted to run advertisements.\nSingle ownership: Nidhi Companies are only allowed to conduct lending and borrowing activities under their names only.\nTime boundness: A Nidhi is only permitted to operate its deposit plans for a maximum of five years.\nConclusion\n\nNidhi Companies as well as some limits connected with it, it may be determined that Nidhi Companies\u2019 advantages unquestionably outweigh their disadvantages. Nidhi Companies have recently been popular in the financial markets due to the range of advantages they offer.\n\nEven those with middle-class incomes can afford the capital needed to form a Nidhi. Furthermore, compared to other financial institutions, the registration process for a Nidhi Company is extremely simple and necessitates less paperwork.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

The investment models can speak about how to put the money in assets.\n\nInvesting in productive assets can be in the form of Public Sources (Government), Private Sources (Corporate) or Combined Sources (Public Private Partnership or PPP).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Public-Private Partnership (PPP)?\nAdvantages of Public-Private Partnership (PPP)\nPublic-Private Partnership (PPP) models\nBOT (Build\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer):\nBOO (Build\u2013Own\u2013Operate):\nBOOT (Build\u2013Own\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer):\nBLT (Build-Lease-Transfer):\nBOLT (Build\u2013Own\u2013Lease\u2013Transfer):\nDBFO (Design\u2013Build\u2013Finance\u2013Operate):\nLDO (Lease\u2013Develop\u2013Operate):\nDCMF (Design\u2013Construct\u2013Manage\u2013Finance):\nOMT (Operate\u2013Maintain\u2013Transfer):\nSome other types of Public-private-partnership (PPP) Models\nManagement Contract Model\nLease Contract Model\nBOT Annuity\nEngineering-Procurement-Construction(EPC) Model\nHybrid Annuity Model (HAM)\nVijay Kelkar Committee Report on Revisiting and Revitalising Public-private-partnership (PPP) Model\nConclusion\nWhat is Public-Private Partnership (PPP)?\n\nA public-private partnership (PPP) unites the public and private sectors to carry out a project or offer a service that is typically handled by the public sector.\n\nPublic-private partnerships (PPPs) come in a variety of shapes and sizes, depending on the private party\u2019s level of involvement and risk tolerance. Normally, the conditions of a PPP are outlined in a contract or agreement to specify the obligations of each partner and allocate risk.\n\nWhen private-sector technology and creativity are combined with public-sector incentives to finish projects on schedule and within budget, these collaborations are successful.\n\nAdvantages of Public-Private Partnership (PPP)\nThe benefit of a PPP is that when appropriate cooperative agreements between the public and private sectors are employed, the management abilities and financial savvy of private enterprises may result in better value for money for taxpayers.\nWhen a project is funded through a public-private partnership, it can either be completed sooner or become feasible because investments are made by the private sector entity for a predetermined amount of time.\nPublic services may become more effective, efficient, and competitive as a result of PPP. In a situation when there are budgetary constraints, it can raise additional funding and supplement the limited public sector capacities.\nPPP does not constitute privatisation because it entails the government\u2019s complete retention of responsibility for delivering the services. The division of risk between the public institution and the private sector is clearly defined.\nThe private company is chosen through an open, competitive bidding process and is compensated depending on performance.\nIn developing nations when governments are constrained in their ability to borrow money for significant projects, the PPP approach may be an alternative.\nIt may also provide the necessary knowledge for large-scale project planning or execution.\nPublic-Private Partnership (PPP) models\n\nCommonly adopted models of PPPs include Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), Build-Own-Operate (BOO), Build-Operate-Lease-Transfer (BOLT), Design-Build-Operate-Transfer (DBFOT), Lease-Develop-Operate (LDO), Operate-Maintain-Transfer (OMT), etc.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThese models are different on the levels of investment, ownership control, risk sharing, technical collaboration, duration, financing etc.\n\nBOT (Build\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer):\nIt follows a standard PPP paradigm where the private partner is in charge of designing, constructing, operating (during the agreed-upon period), and handing back the facility to the public sector.\nThe project\u2019s private sector partner must provide the funding and assume responsibility for its construction and upkeep (usually a greenfield project).\nThe public sector will permit business partners to charge users for services.\nA key illustration of the BOT concept is the national highway projects that NHAI has leased out under the PPP form.\nBOO (Build\u2013Own\u2013Operate):\nAccording to this approach, a private entity will retain ownership of the newly constructed facility.\nThe public sector partner consents to \u201cbuy\u201d the goods and services delivered by the project on mutually acceptable terms and circumstances.\nBOOT (Build\u2013Own\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer):\nIn this BOT form, the project is turned over to the government or a private operator after the agreed-upon period.\nHighway and port construction utilises the BOOT concept.\nBLT (Build-Lease-Transfer):\nThe asset is leased to the public entity for a medium duration and is owned by the private company.\nIn this case, the public entity is in charge of financing the investment.\nBOLT (Build\u2013Own\u2013Lease\u2013Transfer):\nIn this strategy, the government grants a building concession to a private company (and possibly designs it as well).\nThe facility may be owned by a private business, which may then lease it to the public sector and transfer ownership of the facility to the government after the lease term.\nDBFO (Design\u2013Build\u2013Finance\u2013Operate):\nAccording to this approach, the private party is solely responsible for the project\u2019s design, building, financing, and operation throughout the concession period.\nLDO (Lease\u2013Develop\u2013Operate):\nIn this kind of investment arrangement, the public sector organisation or the government keeps ownership of the newly built infrastructure facility and receives payments under the conditions of a lease with the private promoter.\nIt is primarily used for developing airport facilities.\nA private partner is in charge of designing, constructing, operating (during the agreed-upon period) and handing over the facility to the public sector. This is a typical public-private partnership model.\nDBOT is a variant of the build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract model where the contractor is responsible for both the project\u2019s design and construction. Because it identifies a single point of accountability for delivering the project and seeing it through to operation, this approach may be appealing to some clients.\nThe DBOT contract is different from a design build finance and operations (DBFO) contract, in which the contractor also finances the project and leases it to the client for a predetermined amount of time (perhaps 30 years), after which the development reverts to the customer.\nDCMF (Design\u2013Construct\u2013Manage\u2013Finance):\nIn this case, the asset is constructed and run by the private sector for a predetermined time. This time frame can range from 20 to 50 years. For renting out the asset at that time, the Government pays the contractor.\nBy diverting public spending from significant infrastructure development projects, this model may help establish funding sources for other public initiatives.\nThe following are some examples of DCMF PPP models: jails, courts, public hospitals, etc.\nOMT (Operate\u2013Maintain\u2013Transfer):\nThe OMT model is comparable to the BOT model, with the exception that, unlike the BOT model, OMT does not call for the concessionaire for a project.\nFor a predetermined amount of time, the concessionaire is responsible for maintenance under the OMT model.\nSome other types of Public-private-partnership (PPP) Models\n\nDifferent types of PPP include Concessions, Leases / Affermage, Full Divestiture, Contract Plans, and Performance Contracts.\n\nManagement Contract Model\nIn this model, a public facility or service is managed, either entirely or in part, by a private organisation.\nIn this approach, the public body (government) retains ownership of the asset or facility, but a private firm takes over the day-to-day management of the facility.\nThe private entity\u2019s risk exposure is minimal because it is not obligated to make any capital expenditures and is permitted to charge a set fee.\nLease Contract Model\nAccording to this concept, the asset is leased, depending on the circumstance, to either a private organisation or a public entity.\nThe private organisation is permitted to generate income through operations.\nBOT Annuity\nThis technique is used to construct roadways, mostly for NHAI projects where the possibility for revenue generation is low.\nThe asset must be designed, constructed, managed, and maintained by the private business. The private entity\u2019s risk is minimal, though, as it consistently receives a fixed amount as an annuity from the public entity throughout the contract.\nEngineering-Procurement-Construction(EPC) Model\nIn this model, the asset is designed, financed, and constructed by the private entity.\nThe public agency that built the asset eventually receives ownership of it. The public entity pays the private entity a lump amount in exchange for playing the role; the private business is not responsible for operations and management.\nThe NHAI is constructing highways with the use of this model.\nHybrid Annuity Model (HAM)\nIn this arrangement, the private company is required to invest the remaining 40% of the project cost after paying 40% of it from the public entity.\nThe public company continues to be in charge of ownership and operations; the private business is simply required to contribute engineering knowledge.\nVijay Kelkar Committee Report on Revisiting and Revitalising Public-private-partnership (PPP) Model\nIn the Union Budget 2015\u201316, the Finance Minister stated that the PPP method of infrastructure development has to be reviewed and reinvigorated.\nIn response to this declaration, Dr Vijay Kelkar served as the chair of the Committee on Revisiting & Revitalizing the PPP Model of Infrastructure Development.\nConclusion\n\nThe Government of India defined the public-private partnership (PPP or 3P) as a commercial legal relationship in 2011. The User-fee based BOT model, Performance-based management/maintenance contracts, and Modified design-build (turnkey) contracts are three examples of PPPs that are recognised by the Indian government.\n\nNumerous PPP projects are now being implemented across the nation at various stages. PPPs are actively being promoted by the Indian government in many different economic sectors.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

The government envision a prosperous and inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and citizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\nIn the 75th year of our Independence, the world recognised the Indian economy as a \u2018bright star\u2019. Our current year\u2019s economic growth is estimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all the major economies.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis is in spite of the massive slowdown globally caused by Covid-19 and the war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right track, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.\n\nToday, as Indians stands with their head, held high, and the world appreciates India\u2019s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders who fought for India\u2019s independence, will with joy, bless us in our endeavours going forward.\n\nSeven Key Priorities\n\nThe Budget adopts the following seven priorities. They complement each other and act as the \u2018Saptarishi\u2019 guiding us through the Amrit Kaal.\n\nInclusive Development\nReaching the Last Mile\nInfrastructure and Investment\nUnleashing the Potential\nGreen Growth\nYouth Power\nFinancial Sector\nPriority 1: Inclusive Development\n\nThe Government\u2019s philosophy of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas has facilitated inclusive development covering in specific, farmers, women, youth, OBCs, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, divyangjan and economically weaker sections, and overall priority for the underprivileged (vanchiton ko variyata). There has also been a sustained focus on Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and the Northeast. This Budget builds on those efforts.\n\nAGRICULTURE AND COOPERATION\n\nThe following are the important initiatives in this regard\n\nDIGITAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AGRICULTURE\n\nDigital public infrastructure for agriculture will be built as an open source, open standard and interoperable public good. This will enable inclusive, farmer-centric solutions through relevant information services for crop planning and health, improved access to farm inputs, credit, and insurance, help for crop estimation, market intelligence, and support for the growth of the agri-tech industry and start-ups.\n\nAGRICULTURE ACCELERATOR FUND\n\nAn Agriculture Accelerator Fund will be set up to encourage Agri startups by young entrepreneurs in rural areas. The Fund will aim at bringing innovative and affordable solutions for challenges faced by farmers. It will also bring in modern technologies to transform agricultural practices and increase productivity and profitability.\n\nENHANCING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF COTTON CROP\n\nTo enhance the productivity of extra-long staple cotton, we will adopt a cluster-based and value chain approach through Public Private\nPartnerships (PPP).

Read further to know more.\n\nThe goal of the Gold Monetization Scheme is to mobilise the country\u2019s idle gold that is held in homes, institutions, corporations, and temple trusts, make it easier to employ it for productive purposes, and ultimately lessen the country\u2019s dependency on gold imports.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the Gold Monetization Scheme?\nObjectives of the Gold Monetization Scheme\nBenefits of the Gold Monetization Scheme\nSome of the key features of the Gold Monetization Scheme\nCharacteristics of the Gold Monetization Scheme\nDeposit flexibility\nDeposit quantity flexibility\nA tenure that is convenient for you\nAttractive interest rates\nCalculating interest in Gold Monetization Scheme\nWithdrawal of the deposit\nVerification of purity\nWhat are the setback factors of the scheme?\nSolution\nWhat is the Gold Monetization Scheme?\nOn November 5, 2015, the Indian government unveiled the Gold Monetization Scheme (GMS), a programme designed to monetize the gold that is currently stored in Indian households and put it to useful use.\nThe Gold Monetization Scheme makes it possible for gold depositors to receive interest payments on their metal accounts. The gold begins to earn interest as soon as it is placed in the metal account.\nA depositor who makes a short-term deposit of between one and three years will receive 2.25% interest yearly under the plan. The interest rate for medium- and long-term deposits is 2.5 per cent.\nThe government also announced the launch of the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the creation of the Indian Gold Coin in addition to the Gold Monetization Scheme.\n\nAlso read: Coinage of India: Coins used in Ancient India\n\nObjectives of the Gold Monetization Scheme\n\nThe Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) is an initiative by the Government of India to mobilise the gold held by households and institutions in the country to put this gold into productive use and, in the long run, to reduce the current account deficit by reducing the country\u2019s reliance on gold imports to meet the domestic demand.\n\nThe following are some of the main goals of the Gold Monetization Scheme:\n\nmobilisation of the gold that is held by the country\u2019s numerous households.\nto lessen gold imports to supply domestic demand.\nto provide gold loans from banks to assist and enhance the gold and jewellery sectors.\nto give depositors certificates stating the quantity and purity of gold they have placed.\n\nAlso read: Ambergris: The Floating Gold\n\nBenefits of the Gold Monetization Scheme\nThe Gold Deposit Scheme (GDS), which had been in place since 1999, was replaced by the Gold Monetization Scheme. The programme enables gold depositors to receive interest at a rate of 2.25% per year on short-term deposits between one and three years.\nFor medium- and long-term deposits, the depositors receive an interest rate of 2.5 per cent. The programme, which was introduced in 2015, guarantees the mobilisation of gold owned by various Indian families and institutions.\nThe gold monetization plan\u2019s profits are exempt from capital gains tax. Wealth and income taxes are not applied to capital gains.\nLarge Indian families have a tremendous opportunity to profit from outdated jewellery kept away in safe deposit boxes and bank vaults thanks to the Gold Monetization Scheme. This method can be used by businesses, trusts, jewellers, and gold hoarders to profit from their precious metals.\nBut be aware that you won\u2019t get your jewellery back in the exact condition that you gave it to us; instead, you\u2019ll get cash or gold coins and bars that you may use to buy things later.\nSome of the key features of the Gold Monetization Scheme\nThe programme offers no maximum investment limit for short-term bank deposits (1-3 years), medium-term deposits (5-7 years), and long-term government deposits (12-15 years).\nUnder this programme, a gold bar, coin, or piece of jewellery weighing no less than 30 grammes of raw gold may be deposited.\nThe programme permits early withdrawal following a required lock-in period. It does, however, impose a fee for such withdrawals.\nThe Gold Monetization Scheme offers an interest rate of 2.50% annually, which is higher than the rates provided by earlier gold investments.\nThe programme also provides the option to redeem short-term deposits for gold or dollars at the going rate.\n\nAlso read: Bureau of Indian Standards\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCharacteristics of the Gold Monetization Scheme\n\nThe following are its characteristic features.\n\nDeposit flexibility\n\nYou can deposit your gold in any manner. In gold bars, cash, or even jewellery, for example. On the other hand, gold jewellery encrusted with gems is not permitted to be deposited in this plan.\n\nDeposit quantity flexibility\n\nIn a gold monetization strategy, 30 grammes of any purity are the required minimum deposit. No such thing as a maximum limit exists.\n\nA tenure that is convenient for you\n\nThere are three term-deposit alternatives available under the Gold Monetization Scheme:\n\n1 to 3 years is the short-term option\n5 to 7 years in the medium-term option\n12 to 15 years in the long-term option\nAttractive interest rates\n\nFor a product that typically remains unused in homes and lockers, the precious metal can profit you anywhere between 0.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent each year, depending on the deposit duration.\n\nCalculating interest in Gold Monetization Scheme\n\nThe short-term bank deposit for the Gold Monetisation Scheme does not pay cash interest. You receive gold in grammes as a form of interest from it. You will receive 1 gramme on 100 grammes if the interest rate is 1% annually.\n\nWithdrawal of the deposit\n\nWhen you deposit, you can choose whether you want your returns for short-term plans to be in the form of cash or gold itself. You will get 995 fine gold coins or bars if you wish to get your refunds in actual gold.\n\nVerification of purity\n\nOver 330 Collection and Purity Testing Centres have been granted licences across the nation to test and certify the purity of the gold that is being deposited.\n\nWhat are the setback factors of the scheme?\nFew people desire to store their gold in banks for interest rates of 2% to 3%.\nInadequate knowledge of or comprehension of the gold monetization system.\nIndians do use their gold as security for loans, despite their apparent reluctance to part with it in exchange for interest.\nA significant portion of India\u2019s gold reserves\u2014nearly three-fourths\u2014are preserved as sentimental jewellery.\nThe gender aspect of gold in jewellery gives women some degree of control over inheritance and ownership.\nSolution\n\nAccording to the reports, urban households spent more money on the gold than their rural counterparts did. If the urban population is unaware of the scheme, how would the rural population react? It is necessary to increase awareness of the programme.\n\nSecurity, potential capital gains, and liquidity are the three key reasons people hold gold, hence the investors in the programme require immediate liquidity.\n\nIndian authorities ought to be successful in identifying and correcting the problems that led to the failure of the project.\n\nRead:\u00a0Gold loans: why is the RBI keeping an eye on them?\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed",

    "[CONTENT] #864": "The term Dollarization has been used loosely in reference to how foreign money replaces domestic money in any of its functions. The influence of the dollar in the domestic market is also termed dollarization. The Indian central bank has raised concern about the dollarization of the Indian economy by dollar-dominated cryptocurrencies. Read here to learn more.\n\nThe use of a foreign currency in addition to or instead of a domestic one is known as currency substitution. \u00a0When the foreign currency is the dollar or the euro, respectively, the practice is also known as \u201cdollarization\u201d or \u201ceuroization.\u201d\n\nFull or partial currency replacement is possible. Following a severe economic catastrophe, full currency substitution can take place, as it did in Zimbabwe, El Salvador, and Ecuador.\n\nSome smaller economies, for whom maintaining a separate currency is impractical, utilize the currencies of their larger neighbors; Liechtenstein, for instance, uses the Swiss franc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDollarization\nHow did it originate?\nDollarization of the Indian economy\nDe-dollarization of economy\nWay forward\nDollarization\n\nThe term Dollarization has been used loosely in reference to how foreign money replaces domestic money in any of its functions.\n\nThree different concepts of dollarization are:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAsset Dollarization: The term Asset Dollarization refers to the use of foreign currency in any of the three functions of money: unit of account, means of exchange, and store of value\n\nCurrency Substitution refers to the use of foreign money only as means of exchange. Thus, an economy can be highly dollarized, but not subject to currency substitution. Domestic currency may still be used for transactions.\n\nLiability Dollarization: A key point that has emerged in the recent literature on currency and banking crises in emerging markets is that either the domestic banking system or the government can have relatively large foreign currency debt obligations. This concept is called liability dollarization.\n\nTherefore, a country can be scarcely dollarized on the asset side, but the loans made by the banking system can be mostly in foreign currency.\n\nPartial and Full Dollarization: Full Dollarization is a situation in which a country abandons its currency and adopts another country\u2019s currency as a means of payment and unit of account e.g., Panama. Few countries in the world have dollarized completely.\n\nHow did it originate?\n\nFollowing the Bretton Woods Conference after World War II and the abandonment of the gold standard at the start of World War I, several nations sought exchange rate regimes to advance global economic stability and, by extension, their prosperity.\n\nMost nations link their currency to a significant convertible currency. In contrast to \u201csoft pegs,\u201d which are more flexible and floating exchange rate regimes, \u201chard pegs\u201d are exchange rate regimes that show a deeper commitment to a fixed parity (such as currency boards) or give up sovereignty over their currency.\n\nCurrency substitution became a significant policy concern in the late 1990s after \u201csoft\u201d pegs in Southeast Asia and Latin America failed.\n\nThe decision about which exchange rate system to adopt became more difficult as world trade and capital markets became more integrated.\n\nThe newest of the solutions was full dollarization, under which a country officially abandons its currency and adopts a more stable currency of another country- most commonly the U.S. dollar -as its legal tender.\n\nThe main attraction of full dollarization is eliminating the risk of a sudden, sharp devaluation of the country\u2019s exchange rate. This may allow the country to reduce the risk premium attached to its international borrowing.\nDollarized economies could enjoy a higher level of confidence among international investors, lower interest rate spreads on their international borrowing, reduced fiscal costs, and more investment and growth.\nDollarization of the Indian economy\n\nMost developing countries as well as transitional economies just adopting market mechanisms already have a limited, unofficial form of dollarization.\n\nTo a greater or lesser degree, their residents already hold foreign currency and foreign currency-denominated deposits at domestic banks.\nIn high-inflation countries, dollars or some other hard currency may be in widespread use in daily transactions, alongside the local currency.\n\nThe Indian economy has the possibility of becoming \u201cdollarized\u201d as a result of cryptocurrencies, according to RBI officials.\n\nCryptocurrencies are mostly issued by international private companies and are denominated in dollars.\n\nOnly 5% of Indian imports and 15% of its exports are from the US, but 86% of imports and exports are invoiced in dollars.\n\nIt was recognized that large-scale dollar-denominated assets within a country can disrupt the economy by creating the potential for destabilizing flows.\n\nIndia does not allow dollar-denominated transactions between residents. Exchange earners\u2019 foreign currency accounts can be used only for external payments and if such balances have to be used for local payments, they have to be converted into rupees.\n\nThe counterpart of dollarisation is the internationalization of the domestic currency.\n\nFor example, there are instances when a currency of a developing country could be officially traded outside the country without any underlying trade or investment transactions.\nWhen such currencies are held increasingly outside the country and there is a multiplication of such holdings, any expectation that there will be a fall in the currency due to fundamentals or contagion leads to widespread sales which results in a very sharp fall in the currencies especially when the local markets are not well developed.\nIndia does not permit the rupee to be transacted offshore, i.e., the Rupee is not allowed to be officially used as an international means of payment or store of value.\nIndian banks are not permitted to offer two-way quotes to NRIs or non-resident banks.\n\nA highly conservative approach is adopted to the dollarization of the domestic economy and the internationalization of the domestic currency.\n\nIn July 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) unveiled a rupee settlement system for international trade by allowing special vostro accounts in designated Indian banks, a step towards internationalizing the rupee.\n\nAlso read: Effects of Liberalization on the Indian Economy\n\nDe-dollarization of economy\n\nDe-dollarization means lessening the influence of the dollar on international markets.\n\nThe US dollar is being replaced as the unit of account for transactions involving oil and/or other commodities, the purchase of US dollars to cover foreign exchange reserves, bilateral trade agreements, and assets denominated in the US dollar.\n\nBecause of the dominance of the dollar in the world economy, the United States has a significant effect on other economies. The United States has historically used sanctions to advance its foreign policy objectives.\n\nDe-dollarization is being pushed by the need to protect national central banks from geopolitical threats where the US dollar\u2019s status as a reserve currency could be used as a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nA new Russia-China payment system that eschews SWIFT and combines the Russian SPFS (System for Transfer of Financial Messages) and Chinese CIPS is currently being developed (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System).\n\nCentral banks will be forced to reevaluate their reliance on the dollar as a result of the prolonged conflict in Ukraine and the ensuing economic sanctions.\n\nAlso read: Basic Concepts of Economics In Simple Language\n\nWay forward\n\nBy keeping a larger share of their foreign exchange reserves in other currencies, such as the Euro or the Chinese Yuan, governments can lessen their reliance on the US dollar.\n\nCountries can encourage enterprises to utilize their currencies in international trade by offering incentives.\n\nTo lessen their reliance on the dollar, governments might create economic partnerships with other nations. To lessen the risk of currency volatility or to challenge the dominance of the dollar, governments may invest in other currencies.\n\nThe US dollar continues to be the preferred trading currency since no other currency is sufficiently liquid.\n\nThe world does not want a simple regime change or to be the target of the same manipulations, even if they come from another nation. The currency market must become more varied, with no single currency claiming control, to go forward.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Economic nationalism\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish",

This is a good indicator that suggests smaller businesses may be looking for funding beyond their immediate working capital needs.\nThe corporate sector has been recovering steadily, as seen by the Center\u2019s strong direct tax and GST revenues.\nThe states\u2019 combined deficits and net market borrowings have also slightly decreased.\nThe total GDP growth has been driven by the agricultural sector.\n\nAlso read: China Plus One Strategy: Opportunity for India\n\nNegative Implications on the Indian Economy 2023\n\nMost of the global environment is the major source of negative effects on the economic growth of developing countries.\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine continues, the European Union, India\u2019s largest export market, is at risk of an energy-related slowdown.\nA pause in the rate hikes is not likely to occur until well into the second half of 2023, as the US continues to struggle with declining inflation pressure.\nThe World Bank reduced its growth prediction for China from 4.3% in June 2022 to 2.7% this year.\nThe second-largest economy in the world (China) entering a prolonged downturn will cause a significant slowdown in the global economy in 2019.\nGlobal protectionism will increase, as will support for de-globalization and economic fragmentation in 2023.\nManufacturing in India is still unsteady as indicated by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), a gauge of factory output, which fell to a 26-month low in October 2022.\nAs a result, economists have quickly revised their estimates of India\u2019s growth for the upcoming fiscal year downward.\nIt is concerning that private consumption is increasing at a rate of over 9% while manufacturing has decreased by more than 4%.\nAlthough there has been a slight increase, capacity utilization is still stuck around the 75% level. Private investments are unlikely to noticeably increase unless this rises steadily.\nThe Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) businesses are still in crisis. This demonstrates the stark differences in the performance of larger and smaller businesses during the industrial recovery.\nGiven that MSMEs employ a substantial portion of the labor force, their ongoing financial stress is indicative of the labor market\u2019s suffering and has a domino effect on the recovery of demand.\nThe states\u2019 capital spending has remained low. State investments often have a greater multiplier effect.\nDespite having increased its benchmark lending rate by 225 basis points since May 2022, managing inflation expectations in 2023 may prove difficult in the future.\nAt 4% of its GDP, India\u2019s reliance on imported energy presents a problem for the country\u2019s balance of payments.\nFor FY23, a current account deficit of substantially over 3% is anticipated.\nRural communities\u2019 substantially greater inflation is further reducing expenditure there.\nWay forward\n\nThe government, private parties, organized and unorganized sectors, and large and small businesses have all worked together consistently to advance India. The Indian economy has defied expectations following the covid outbreak.\n\nThe country\u2019s young workforce\u2019s potential can be unlocked by giving the system a boost as the Skill India Mission is already in place. The economy could benefit greatly from this action for a very long period.\n\nChina is already becoming a less desirable location for manufacturing due to geopolitics. Global corporations aiming to relocate their centers outside of the East Asian economic superpower could be advantageous for India.\n\nIndia should look at creating special investment zones and approval windows for companies to deploy infrastructure, talent, and research.\n\nTo accommodate the tens of thousands of students who will soon enter the workforce, India must update its regulations. According to analysts, the budget for 2023 has to reflect this with a focus on developing finishing school programs and industry institution alliances so that the upcoming class of freshmen can get started quickly.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

According to reports, China spends 20% of its GDP on infrastructure development, compared to India\u2019s 4.3% annual expenditure.\n\nIn an effort to promote the expansion of the manufacturing sector, the Indian government introduced the \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative in September 2014. This was done primarily to support India\u2019s status as the preferred location for global manufacturing and to stimulate the design, innovation, and startup sectors.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInfrastructure and Economic Development\nComplete Government\nComplete Private\nPublic Private Partnership (PPP)\nNecessary Steps to Boost Economic Development and Infrastructure\nChallenges\nIIPDF Scheme\nNational Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)\nInfrastructure Development Projects\nConclusion\nInfrastructure and Economic Development\n\nSince independence, the government has had the full responsibility of providing the entire infrastructure like rail, roads, ports, power, airports, etc. But due to its capital-intensive nature, financial constraints, and human resource constraints, the government after LPG reforms (post-1991) seek the help of the private sector to bridge the infrastructural gap in the country.\n\nIn an economy, infrastructure can be built on the following three models:\n\nComplete Government\nPublic Private Partnership (PPP)\ncomplete Private\nComplete Government\n\nGovernment constructs the entire infrastructure with a financial burden on its own and outsource some tasks and operation. Its maintenance is done by the government itself.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nComplete Private\n\nPrivate construction is responsible for the construction, maintenance, and operation of the infrastructure but the traffic may be regulated by the government.\n\nPublic Private Partnership (PPP)\n\nThe PPPs, which were implemented in the early 1990s, redefined the roles of the public and private sectors in the provision of public services. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are a mechanism for the public and private sectors to work together to implement and maintain a project (often an infrastructure project) for the delivery of goods and services.\n\nIn a typical PPP project, generally, the government shall be responsible for getting all the clearances like environment, forest, water, power, and land acquisition and the private party shall be responsible for the construction and maintenance of the project. Any political risks like nationalization of a project, government abandoning the project in between, war or social unrest shall be taken care of by the government and the private party shall take care of design and construction quality and maintenance facilities.\n\nNecessary Steps to Boost Economic Development and Infrastructure\n\nA Robust Strategy: Procurement strategy is a very important aspect of the overall execution of infrastructure projects.\n\nTechnological Obsolescence: The entire project execution chain, including engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning, uses technology. Though it is challenging for leaders to keep up with technological advancements from beginning to end.\n\nPlanning Strategy: The supply chain is a major issue for construction companies due to the vast variety and quantum of raw materials and supplies required. It requires proper planning and a crisis management plan to tackle sudden uncertainties.\n\nChallenges\n\nMany infrastructure projects are today financially stressed, accounting for almost a third of stressed assets (Non-Performing Assets) in banks.\n\nLarge-scale infrastructure projects have been hampered by delays brought on by successive COVID-19 waves combined with a nationwide lockdown.\n\nCurrent contracts place more of an emphasis on financial (government revenue) benefits than on providing services effectively. For instance, the bidder giving the highest revenue share to the government gets chosen for port and airport contracts.\n\nOf late the government has started shifting its own responsibilities such as land acquisition, environmental and forest clearances, etc. in various projects to the private parties. If the private party is unable to obtain the clearances, it may abandon the project in the middle. As a result, there are disagreements between the public and private sectors, and the project is severely delayed.\n\nUncertainties and disruptions in the supply chain are serious problems that require immediate attention. Construction companies experienced severe shortages of building materials, a lack of transport capacity, and prolonged wait periods for construction supplies imported from overseas due to port congestion.\n\nThere is no existing structure for the renegotiation of projects in case of failure. If a bureaucrat restructures a project, there are no rewards; instead, it may lead to an investigation for graft. So, in such cases of failed projects, bureaucrats naturally avoid renegotiation and the project suffers long delays and court cases.\n\nCertain bidders are involved in reckless bidding (very aggressive in quoting prices) as they that the government will come to their rescue in case the project faces financial distress (for example Tata Ultra Mega Power Project in Gujarat).\n\nAlso read: Non-Performing Assets (NPA): How serious is India\u2019s bad loan problem?\n\nIIPDF Scheme\n\nThe Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, announces the India Infrastructure Project Development Fund Scheme (IIPDF Scheme) for Financial Support for Project Development Expenses.\n\nThe India Infrastructure Project Development Fund Scheme (IIPDF Scheme), a Central Sector Scheme, would assist in the development of high-quality PPP projects by providing the financial support required to the project sponsoring authorities, both in the Central and State Governments, for developing a shelf of bankable viable PPP projects to achieve the goal of modern infrastructure for the country.\n\nThe DEA is putting a lot of emphasis on enhancing the quality and rate of infrastructure development in the country by encouraging private sector involvement in the sector. The DEA has taken a leading role in developing the ideal legal framework for private investment in infrastructure development. PPPs are promoted as a way to bring private capital and efficiency to the planning, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure projects. In addition, new programs and initiatives are being introduced to offer the private sector financial and technical support as needed.\n\nNational Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)\n\nPublic Private Partnership in Infrastructure has been an important sector investment source. India is ranked second among developing countries in terms of both the quantity of PPP Projects and the related investments, according to the World Bank\u2019s database on private participation in infrastructure.\n\nIndia has to invest around $1.4 trillion in infrastructure over the next few years in order to reach a GDP of $5 trillion by 2024\u201325. In order to achieve this goal, the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) was established with a planned infrastructure investment of around 111 lakh crores (US$ 1.5 trillion) between 2020-25.\n\nInfrastructure Development Projects\n\nTo improve connectivity in the North Eastern Region, various infrastructure development projects have been undertaken by the relevant Ministries and Departments of the Central Government. These are related to enhancing the NER\u2019s air, rail, road, waterway, power, and telecommunications connectivity.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, India is certain to experience increased infrastructure expansion as a result of the government prioritizing infrastructure for overall economic development.\n\nGatiShakti, for example, is a significant \u201cproductivity\u201d booster initiative for the infrastructure industry. This program will assist in removing significant bottlenecks caused by the abundance of approvals and the lengthy clearing processes. Its multiplying effects will speed up project execution and keep expenses in check.\n\nThe program has the same transformational impact on the infrastructure market that the 1990s liberalization did. Additionally, given the endless possibilities, engaging private companies in national infrastructure projects may aid India in raising its infrastructure to international levels.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Due to this decline in the currency, the Indian rupee has had Asia\u2019s worst performance. First, let us try to understand what\u00a0 Depreciation of Currency is.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDepreciation of Currency\nReasons for the Indian Rupee\u2019s present depreciation\nImpact of the Depreciation of the Indian Rupee\nRole of the Reserve Bank of India\nSteps to Prevent Rupee\u00a0Depreciation\nOptions open to policymakers and the RBI\nWay ahead\nConclusion\nDepreciation of Currency\n\nDepreciation of currency refers to the decline in the value of a nation\u2019s money in relation to one or more foreign reference currencies, most frequently occurring through an unofficial, floating exchange rate regime.\n\nBy making its goods and services more accessible to consumers, a country\u2019s export activity may be boosted by a controlled currency devaluation. However, a country\u2019s currency depreciation could spread to its neighbours.\n\nRupee depreciation in India means that the value of the rupee relative to the US dollar has decreased. It means that the rupee is today less strong than it was.\n\nA dollar, for instance, used to be equal to 70 rupees; today, it is equal to 77, indicating that the rupee has declined in value relative to the currency and that it now costs more rupees to buy a dollar.\n\nNumerous variables, such as lax monetary policy and excessive inflation, contribute to currency depreciation. Sudden currency devaluation, particularly in developing countries, frequently raises investor fears, and the majority of these currencies suffer similarly.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nLet us move on to the various reasons for the Indian Rupee\u2019s present depreciation.\n\nReasons for the Indian Rupee\u2019s present depreciation\nDue to greater imports, India\u2019s trade deficit grew to an all-time high of over $23 billion in November.\nThis expanding trade gap is caused by the increase in oil costs.\nPolicy differences between the Federal Reserve and the RBI: the strengthening of the US currency in reaction to the Federal Reserve\u2019s low-interest rates and predictions of improved US economic development (the US central bank).\nIn order to increase its reserves and be ready for any future turbulence, the Reserve Bank of India has been continuously purchasing US dollars.\nDue to a capital exodus from stocks, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index has decreased by almost 10% from its all-time high set in October 2021.\nCurrently, worries about the omicron virus type are unsettling the world markets.\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine, rising crude oil prices, and tightening global financial conditions are some of the primary worldwide causes that have caused the Indian rupee to decline versus the US dollar.\nSignificant demand for dollars from oil importers due to the high price of crude oil and worries about the widening trade deficit has also been major drivers of the sharp decline in the value of the Indian rupee.\nThe increase in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve (central bank), the European conflict, and worries about China\u2019s economic development as a result of the Covid-19 rise all contributed to a sell-off in the global equity markets, which in turn caused the rupee to weaken.\nHigh crude prices and the slump in equities markets are both contributing to the dollar\u2019s negative outflow.\n\u00a0The RBI\u2019s efforts to tighten the monetary policy in response to growing inflation have also resulted in devaluation.\nImpact of the Depreciation of the Indian Rupee\n\nThe rupee\u2019s depreciation is a double-edged sword for the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nTheoretically, a weaker currency should increase India\u2019s exports, but given the current state of global uncertainty and the country\u2019s weak demand, this may not be the case.\nIt raises the possibility of imported inflation and may make it challenging for the central bank to sustain historically low-interest rates for a more extended period of time.\nOver two-thirds of India\u2019s domestic oil needs are satisfied by imports. Among the major importers of edible oils in India. A weaker currency will drive up the cost of imported edible oil and increase food inflation.\nImports will cost more because importers will have to pay more for the same amount of dollars when the dollar appreciates versus the rupee. Additionally, importers must pay more because most foreign trade is conducted in US dollars.\nTherefore, a falling rupee will make imports more expensive, putting further strain on household budgets in a nation where the economy is dependent on imports.\nSince India imports, more than 85% of the oil and 50% of the gas it uses, the oil and gas industry will be the one that suffers the most.\nImported solar cells and modules are significantly reliant on Indian solar installations. Future bids would have higher tariffs and project expenses.\nThrough rising import costs, a falling rupee immediately affects India\u2019s trade balance and inflation.\nCostlier imports will increase both the trade and current account deficits, putting pressure on the currency rate. The nation\u2019s current account deficit will increase.\nIncreased import costs are also contributing to domestic inflation.\n\u00a0Depreciation benefits export-related companies like pharma and IT.\nThe rupee will lose value and foreign exchange reserves as the current account deficit inevitably grows.\nWhen overall prices rise (inflation) as a result of rising costs for wages and raw materials, this phenomenon is referred to as cost-push inflation, also referred to as wage-push inflation.\nIt\u2019s possible that businesses won\u2019t be able to fully pass on increased prices to consumers, which would have an impact on government dividend payments and raise concerns about planned fiscal deficits.\nAs India imports a lot of raw materials, this could affect consumers by raising the cost of completed items.\nIt will cost more rupees for travellers and students studying abroad to purchase dollars from banks.\nA weaker rupee could cause foreign investors to stop investing in Indian markets, which would lead to a drop in stock and equity mutual fund investments.\nRole of the Reserve Bank of India\nThe RBI keeps a close eye on the foreign currency market and steps in when there is too much volatility.\nRecent actions by the RBI to ensure foreign currency inflow and support the rupee include lowering restrictions on foreign ownership of government bonds and raising the borrowing limits for businesses. However, bond yields in the USA have yielded higher rates of return than any Indian investment.\nAdditionally, the RBI has suggested the rupee settlement method, which would allow overseas businesses to make payments in rupees rather than US dollars.\nThis should lower the demand for US dollars in international trade and stabilise their value.\n\nAlso read: Rupee Devaluation or Depreciation: How does it affect Export and Import? \u2013 Clear IAS\n\nWhat are the measures to prevent Rupee Depreciation? They are discussed below.\n\nSteps to Prevent Rupee\u00a0Depreciation\n\nThe following steps can be taken to reduce rupee depreciation.\n\nAllowing foreign central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and endowment funds to invest in government bonds.\nIncreasing the cap on foreign investment.\nThe RBI has the option to sell some of its foreign currency reserves in order to manage the weakening rupee, and it is already doing so.\nBoost the weak industrial growth.\nIncreased export incentives and decreased imports\nKeep your foreign currency spending to a minimum.\nThe RBI may take action to encourage capital inflows into NRI accounts in order to increase the amount of money going into those accounts.\nWhen NRIs start making deposits in India, they\u2019ll be selling their dollars and exchanging them for rupees, which will help the cause.\nThe RBI can speak with banks to persuade them to give non-residents greater interest rates on deposits and short-term bonds.\nIn a buy/sell exchange, dollars are withdrawn while Indian rupees are injected into the banking system.The swap will help the RBI, however in a limited way, control currency rates.\nOptions open to policymakers and the RBI\nThe RBI cannot and should not attempt to stop the rupee from sinking indefinitely.\nIndia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves will eventually run out if it defends the rupee because international investors have considerably more sway in the financial world.\nThe majority of analysts think that allowing the rupee to weaken and serve as a natural shock absorber to the unfavourable terms of trade is the wiser course of action.\nThe government should limit its borrowing, and the RBI should concentrate on reducing inflation as required by law.\nWay ahead\nCorporations\u2019 inclusion in important global indices like MSCI and FTSE: The government should promote the inclusion of some of the large market cap companies (both in the public and private sectors).\nAs investors are unlikely to be underweight on India, this will assist raise the weight of Indian equities in these indices, partially offsetting foreign portfolio outflows.\nInclusion of India into bond indices. The government might potentially hasten India\u2019s entry into bond indices like the Barclays Global Bond Index and the J.P. Morgan Emerging-Market Bond Index.\nAdditionally, causing foreign inflows will have a favourable effect on interest rates.\nBy taking these steps, the RBI will be able to maintain its FX war chest at a comfortable level and have the necessary tools at its disposal should there be a further weakness.\nThe maintenance of the interest rate differential between the United States and India, together with timely interventions on the foreign exchange market by the central bank to control volatility, will prove beneficial in protecting the rupee\u2019s value versus the dollar.\nConclusion\n\nThe currency\u2019s decline is probably going to make exports more competitive, which benefits the economy. The rupee has remained more resilient than in other earlier crises, such as the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and the Taper Tantrum of 2013.\n\nThe rupee has lost value when compared to the US dollar, but it has gained value when compared to other major currencies like the euro and the Japanese yen. However, India is now dealing with high inflation, and more depreciation could make problems worse. As the value of the rupee continues to fall, there is a potential that the central bank would interfere once more.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

The basis for calculating this tax is a company\u2019s net income. These are the various sources of income a business receives.\n\nProfits earned by the business\nIncome from renting a property\nCapital gains\nIncome from other sources\n\nCompanies, both domestic and foreign, are liable to pay an annual corporate tax. It is, therefore, based on the above income earned in a given financial year.\n\nDomestic companies\n\nBoth public and private businesses that are registered under the Companies Act of 1956 must pay this tax.\nCurrently, domestic businesses pay a 30% tax rate. Additionally, if net income is between Rs. 1 crore and Rs. 10 crores, the Income Tax Act imposes a 7% surcharge.\nA 12% surcharge is applied to a company\u2019s net income exceeding Rs. 10 crores.\n2019 saw the introduction of Section 115BAA by the Indian government through the Taxation (Amendment) Ordinance.\nThis resulted in many changes to the Income Tax Act, including a reduction in the corporation tax rate for domestic businesses.\nDomestic firms now can pay tax at a rate of 25.168% thanks to Section 115BAA.\n\nForeign Companies\n\nOn the money they earn within a certain period, foreign corporations are required to pay corporate income tax.\nRoyalties and other fees are subject to a 50% corporation tax rate in India, while the remaining revenue is subject to a 40% tax rate.\nA 2% surcharge is applied to foreign companies with net incomes between Rs. 1 crore and Rs. 10 crore.\nIf its net income surpasses Rs. 10 crores, a 5% surcharge will be added.\n\nAdditional charges\n\nNo matter the level of a company\u2019s net income, a 4% Health and Education Cess is imposed on the total income tax and the surcharge.\nAdditionally, under Section 115JB of the Act, businesses receiving advantages under Section 115BAA are excluded from paying Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT).\nMAT is applied to start with AY 2020\u20132021 at a rate of 15%.\nThe Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2019\nCurrently, domestic companies with an annual turnover of up to Rs 400 crore pay income tax at the rate of 25%. For other domestic companies, the corporate tax rate is 30%. The Bill provides domestic companies with an option to pay tax at the rate of 22%, provided they do not claim certain deductions under the Income Tax Act.\nThe Bill provides new domestic manufacturing companies with an option to pay income tax at the rate of 15%, provided they do not claim certain deductions. These new domestic manufacturing companies must be set up and registered after September 30, 2019, and start manufacturing before April 1, 2023.\nA company can choose to opt for the new tax rates in the financial year 2019-20 (i.e. assessment year 2020-21) or any other financial year in the future. Once a company exercises this option, the chosen provider will apply for all subsequent years.\nProvisions regarding payment of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) will not apply to companies opting for the new tax rates. MAT is the minimum amount of tax required to be paid by a company, in case its normal tax liability after claiming deductions falls below a certain limit. The Bill adds that the provisions regarding MAT credit will also not apply to companies opting for the new rates.\nThe Ordinance reduces the MAT rate (applicable for companies not opting for the new tax rates) from 18.5% to 15% with effect from the financial year 2019-20. The Bill amends this provision by making it effective from the financial year 2020-21.\nConclusion\n\nThe government has gradually cut the business tax rates to make India more competitive on a global scale.\n\nThe reduced corporate tax rate of 25% was extended to all businesses with an annual turnover of up to Rs 400 crore by the Union Budget 2019\u201320. It was anticipated that this would apply to 99.3% of businesses.\n\nFor newly created domestic manufacturing units, a favorable tax regime of 22% for existing businesses and 15% for corporations was also introduced, providing they do not take advantage of any specific deductions or incentives. The last day to use this is March 31, 2024.\n\nAlso, India\u2019s corporate tax collections exceeded 3% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) for the first time in two years.\n\nAlso Read: Types of Taxes in India; Global\u00a0Minimum Corporate Tax\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish",

The majority of State Electricity Boards operate at a loss and are in terrible shape.\nAlthough it only employs less than 30% of the workforce, the service sector is the largest contributor to GDP growth. In contrast, the agricultural sector employs 45% of the workers but only makes up 15% of GDP growth.\nIn comparison to medium- and large-scale industrial and service sectors, the Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSME) sector seems to have less favorable access to finance and greater costs for working capital.\nThe manufacturing industry in India faces a workforce shortage, which is limiting its ability to expand.\nNumerous intricate laws, including licensing, tender, and audit, apply to India\u2019s manufacturing industry, which can be burdensome for enterprises and impede their expansion.\nAdditionally, the industry is frequently hampered by subpar supply chain management, which can result in inefficiencies and higher costs.\nDue to the fierce rivalry from other nations in the manufacturing industry, it may be challenging for indigenous companies to compete in the global market.\nAdditionally, India remains dependent on imports from abroad for things like plastic materials, iron and steel, paper, chemicals and fertilizers, and both electrical and non-electrical gear.\nGovernment initiatives\n\nIndia is making slow but steady progress toward Industry 4.0 thanks to government initiatives like:\n\nThe National Manufacturing Policy aims to raise manufacturing\u2019s GDP share to 25% by 2025.\nNational Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)\nThe PLI scheme for Manufacturing, which was introduced in 2022 and aims to bring India\u2019s core manufacturing sector up to par with international manufacturing standards.\n\u2018Make in India\u2019 program to place India on the world map as a manufacturing hub and give global recognition to the Indian economy.

Seven Textile Parks will be established over three years.\nThe \u2018Operation Green\u2018 scheme of the Ministry of the Food Processing Industry, which was limited to onions, potatoes, and tomatoes, has been expanded to 22 perishable products to encourage exports from the agricultural sector. This will facilitate infrastructure projects for horticulture products.\nThe government of India\u2019s Ministry for Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises is SAMARTH Udyog Bharat 4.0, or SAMARTH Advanced Manufacturing and Rapid Transformation Hubs.

With a GDP of US$2.5 trillion and a population of 1.32 billion, India will become a common market after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is implemented, which would be very attractive to investors.\n\nAccording to the Indian Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), by regulatory changes, India could increase its total capacity for producing laptops and tablets to US$ 100 billion by 2025.\n\nThe Government seeks to ensure the overall growth of the country by emphasizing the development of industrial corridors and smart cities. The corridors will also support advanced manufacturing techniques by integrating, monitoring, and creating an atmosphere that is favorable to industrial progress.\n\nThe industrial sector may draw additional investment and enterprises if infrastructure, such as ports, highways, and power supplies, is improved in terms of both quality and accessibility.\n\nThis can entail constructing brand-new infrastructure or improving already-existing infrastructure.\n\nSupporting the growth of export-oriented manufacturing could aid Indian companies in expanding into new markets and becoming more competitive.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

This was part of the government\u2019s effort to maintain food inflation within reasonable bounds.\n\nThe buffer stocks also assist the government in implementing its social welfare programs for the needy and poorer segments of society.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFood grains for welfare programs\n\nThe government\u2019s social welfare programs, such as the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) and Other Welfare Schemes (OWS), such as the mid-day meal program for school-age children, the distribution of food to those who have been displaced by natural disasters, etc., are made possible by the food stock procurement.\n\nRead: Food Security in India\n\nBuffer Norms\n\nThe minimal amount of food grains that the central government must keep on hand at the start of every quarter to ensure adequate supplies for the public distribution system and other government distribution programmes.\n\nFood Stock held by the following entities is accessible in the central government\u2019s pool: State Government Agencies (SGAs) States participating in the Decentralized Procurement Scheme Food Corporation of India (FCI)\n\nThroughout the year, food grains from the Central Pool are dispersed based on patterns in off-take and procurement. As a result, a key component in determining the minimum food grain reserves needed in any given quarter of the year is the season of production and procurement.\n\nThe GoI\u2019s current buffer stock stocking standards include the following:\n\nOperational Stocks: The quantity of stock needed to satisfy TDPS and OWS monthly requirements.\nFood security stocks: The supplies on hand to cover any gaps in purchasing.\n\nOperational stock refers to the food grains used for OWS and TDPS distribution, whereas operational stock and buffer stock both refer to the surplus. The stock over the minimal stockpiling standards is considered excess stock. It is occasionally exported, given to select states in additional allocations, or sold on the open market.\n\nChallenges of Buffer stocks\nHigh Cost of Logistics and Administration: The Agricultural Ministry and FCI have difficulty adjusting the budget to make money available for the effective creation and operation of the storage units because the majority of the funds are allocated for purchasing the buffer stocks. These examples show how this is possible:\nDual Wastage: In India, a significant portion of the population is dying from hunger while at the same time, enormous amounts of food inventories degrade due to improper storage techniques.\nIssues with warehousing include a lack of adequate storage space and other infrastructure following the purchase.\nWastage: In open, outdoor storage, rats, frost, and rain frequently cause the food grains to spoil, costing the government a great deal of money.\nTransportation problems: Moving grains to and from the FCI godowns is quite expensive. The losses are also increased by spills and deterioration that occur during shipment.\nDiversion and theft: The buffer stockpiles may occasionally be taken and given to ghost recipients, alcoholic beverage manufacturing facilities, and illicit markets. By doing this, a large portion of the population is starved while others gain from the buffer stockpiles of food grains in place of the target population.\nThe practice of trade distortion: Many Western industrialised nations view the government\u2019s purchase of food grains and upkeep of buffer stockpiles as a trade-distorting activity. Regarding the same, they drag India to the WTO.\nA skewed pattern of crop output results from integrating buffer stocks with MSP for staple grains like rice and wheat. These crops require a lot of water to grow, so more fertiliser needs to be applied for them to be more productive. This compromises the nutritional security of India by impacting crop diversity in addition to the environment. Farmers who live in areas where it is difficult to grow rice and wheat will likewise be more likely to grow rice and wheat.\nOpen-Ended Procurement: The open-ended procurement of the food stocks further complicates the proper storage and consumption of the buffer stocks in the absence of an accurate estimate of the overall buffer stock needed to run the PDS and in emergencies.\nWay forward\n\nIn order to enhance FCI\u2019s financial management and operational effectiveness in the purchase, storage, and distribution of food grains, the government established the six-person Shanta Kumar committee. The committee\u2019s recommendations included restructuring or unbundling FCI. Important suggestions made include the following:\n\nReduce from the present 67% to 40% the number of recipients under the National Food Security Act.\nPermit the private sector to buy and store grains of food.\nThe minimum support price (MSP) and food subsidy amounts can be directly transferred to the accounts of farmers and food security beneficiaries if bonuses on MSP payments made by governments to farmers are stopped and a direct benefit transfer system is adopted.\nOnly in states with weak procurement capabilities could FCI engage in full-fledged grain procurement.\nStates should handle procurement in the cases of conditions that are performing well, such as Haryana, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Odisha.\nEliminating levy rice is the term for the rice that the government compulsorily purchases from the mills under the levy rice programme, which ranges from 25 to 75% in different states. Only the remaining may be sold by mills on the open market.\nDe-regulate the fertiliser industry and give farmers a cash subsidy for fertiliser of Rs 7,000 per hectare.\nGrain outsourcing: The committee urges the implementation of a negotiable warehouse receipt (NWR) system.\nFarmers can deposit their produce in these authorised warehouses under the new arrangement, and the bank will advance them 80% of the MSP value of their produce.\nClear and open buffer stock liquidation procedures: FCI should be given more freedom to conduct business; when needed, it should sell surplus goods on the open market or export.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

While the Center pays for food and fertiliser subsidies, the corresponding state government is responsible for electricity and irrigation subsidies.\n\nCredit stipends are distributed via the banking system.\n\nThe price at which the Food Corporation of India (FCI) purchases from farmers and sells through the Public Distribution System is what is referred to as a food subsidy (PDS).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nRead:\u00a0Nutrient based subsidy scheme\n\nNeed for farm subsidies\nAccording to Article 48 of the Indian Constitution, it is the state\u2019s duty to modernise agricultural organisations.\nAccording to FAO, 70% of rural Indian households depend mostly on agriculture for their subsistence.\nOne technique for distributing income and reducing inequality is subsidies\nFarmers only receive a little portion of their income (less than one-third of non-farmers income).\nFarm subsidies provide farmers with supplemental money that can be reinvested back into the industry.\nFarm subsidies Increase in production Access to high-quality inputs like seeds and fertiliser better revenue for farmers.\nFarm subsidies in specific ways encourage farmers to keep farming as a profession.\nProtect farmers from the problems that are caused by covid 19.\nTypes \u00a0of Agriculture Subsidies\n\nDifferent types of farm subsidies include:\n\nExplicit Input Subsidies\n\nFarmers receive these specialised cost subsidies to assist them in controlling the costs of the inputs required before production. Typically, these are given to small and marginal farmers who are unable to buy high-quality inputs on their own. Utilizing modern technologies, the goal is to maximise productivity. Utilizing modern technologies, the goal is to maximise productivity.\n\nImplicit\u00a0Input Subsidies\n\nThese are covert subsidies, not payments in the traditional sense. In this situation, the input prices of the products are controlled, for instance, by low electricity costs.\n\nOutput subsidies\n\nPrices on the domestic market are kept higher than they would have been as a result of the restrictive trade rules.\n\nSimilar to this, agricultural subsidies can also be classified as Direct Subsidies and Indirect Subsidies based on the method of payment.\n\nDirect Subsidies\n\nDirect farm subsidies are those that are paid in the form of a direct cash subsidy and are given to farmers directly. In direct subsidies, the beneficiary pays the same price for the product but receives a separate payment for the purchase.\n\nThe PM Kisan Scheme, PAHAL in LPG, and agricultural loan waivers are a few examples of direct farm subsidies.\n\nDirect farm subsidies have some benefits.\n\nBenefits of Direct farm subsidies\nDirect subsidies aid in boosting farmers\u2019 purchasing power and enhancing the general level of living.\nGovernment empowerment through direct cash transfers allows recipients to choose their purchases based on their requirements.\nSince money is given to beneficiaries directly, it also aids in preventing the misuse of public funds.\nDirect payments also reduce wasteful resource use. Ex: Farmers will buy fertiliser at full price and only what is required.\nFarmers can invest the money they get in their businesses as capital.\nReduces the expense of the government, releasing funds for storage and transportation.\n\u00a0Issues of Direct farm subsidies\nRural communities have inadequate ATM and banking service accessibility and a lack of financial inclusion.\nThe potential for farmers to use the funds for non-farm, wasteful uses.\nInflation may result from increased public access to money.\nMay affect the nation\u2019s food security.\nImportant problems like agricultural innovation and market reform went neglected.\nProblems with beneficiary identification.\nIndirect\u00a0Subsidies\n\nIt is indirect as there are no direct transfers or payments involved. They can be in the form of lower prices, welfare mechanisms, more affordable credit, insurance options, waivers of agricultural loan payments, etc. These payments are mostly made to farmers in conjunction with the use of inputs, and as a result, they are closely tied to the volume of those payments.\n\nThe cost of the product is set at a lower price than the market price in cases of indirect subsidies. Indirect subsidies account for about 2% of India\u2019s GDP. An indirect subsidy is any non-cash advantage that a recipient receives to support its operations or competitiveness. Modifications to the tax code are a common form of indirect subsidy.\n\nExamples include MSP (Minimum Support Price), fertiliser, credit, and irrigation subsidies.\n\nPositive aspects of Indirect subsidies\nThese are crucial in fostering agricultural technology and infrastructure development. Ex: Subsidies for infrastructure.\nFarmers are guaranteed high-quality inputs through subsidies for seeds and fertiliser, which helps to raise farm output.\nEncourages farmers to adopt sustainable practises like crop diversification by helping to alter their behaviour.\nThe indirect subsidies that provide farmers knowledge also include farmer training.\nEnsures the nation\u2019s food security.\nContribute to limiting the outflow from the agricultural industry to other sectors\nThese aid in the development of underdeveloped priority areas.\nIn the 1960s, when the nation was experiencing severe food scarcity, the goal was to attain food security. The green revolution gave farmers access to high-quality crops and fertilisers.\nThese are designed to offer farmers technical and training support to increase productivity.\n\u00a0Issues of Indirect farm subsidies\nAgriculture has become dominated by cereals and has altered production patterns as a result of subsidies like MSP.\nDesertification is a result of the overuse of natural resources caused by subsidies for power, irrigation, and fertiliser.\nDue to intermediaries, indirect subsidies are tainted by corruption and leaks. Ex: PDS where leakages and the presence of ghost beneficiaries are noted.\nThe WTO\u2019s Amber box refers to market-distorting subsidies that are under pressure from the international community to be reduced.\nThe current administration can offer incentives for minimal political gain in \u201cvote bank politics.\u201d\nThese have resulted in agriculture centred on cereal and skewed crop patterns. Groundwater supplies, for example, are being depleted rapidly. They don\u2019t see any benefit to conserving resources.\nAnother drawback is the prejudice towards large farm owners and regional differences. Due to flaws like corruption, identification, lobbying by wealthy farmers, etc., they frequently fail to reach the intended beneficiaries.\nTypically, it is utilised improperly during elections to advance political goals, such as the remission of farm loans.\nIt doesn\u2019t result in the development\nIssues related to farm subsidies in general\nAccording to the Economic Survey 2018, wealthy farmers gain more from farm subsidies than small farmers.\nOnly roughly Rs. 3000-4000 crore of the Rs. 1.70 lakh crore allocated for food subsidies in the budget for 2018\u201319 was invested in agriculture, demonstrating wasteful spending rather than the assistance of agriculture.\nThe financial exchequer is burdened by subsidies, which result in a significant financial deficit.\nSubsidy culture may encourage inefficiency and reliance on the government while weakening incentives for improvement.\nSubsidy policies may encourage other nations to pursue similar goals, which could result in trade conflicts and protectionist measures.\nInternational issues caused by subsidies\nThe de minimus levels of AMS (Aggregate Measures of Support), where wealthy nations like the USA pay subsidies >50% in some items like cotton and sugar, are not in reach for developing nations like India and China.\nSubsidies in affluent nations also serve as a barrier to the importation of goods from developing nations.\nThe amount of subsidies given to wealthy nations is significantly more than that of developing nations like India.\nDue to the omission of equality, the WTO-signed Agreement on Agriculture contains loopholes. Spending on input subsidies and price support measures combined cannot exceed 10% of the entire value of agricultural production in developing nations and only 5% of the value of agricultural production in industrialised countries.\nMeasures and suggestions to tackle the issues\nThe Kelker Committee suggested converting subsidies into capital investments and gradually eliminating them.\nStopping subsidies that aren\u2019t producing the desired results will help to rationalise subsidies.\nLong-term policies on export commerce are required to preserve continuity and maintain farmers\u2019 alignment with exports.\nEncouraging financial inclusion activities in rural areas.\nBuilding warehouses and cold storage facilities close to the farm gate.\nThe agri-sector is being developed holistically by fortifying backwards and forward connections.\nThere should be a time limit on subsidies.\nencouraging programmes like cooperative and contract farming to make agriculture profitable.\nThe agricultural laws should be properly executed since they are a good step toward giving farmers more authority and diminishing APMC markets\u2018 monopoly.\nThe security of both food and nutrition should be a government priority.\nConstructing a system for market information to include price and demand projections that assist farmers in improved price realisation and assist farmers in selecting the crop.\nInternational measures\nUnder the Nairobi WTO package, developed and developing nations have pledged to gradually eliminate export subsidies.\nTo minimise the large agricultural subsidies to wealthy nations, India and China together filed a proposal to the WTO.\nSubsidies should be limited based on a specific commodity, such as cotton, wool, etc., rather than the total agricultural value production.\nAccording to the requests of developing countries, the base year used to compute the de-minimus level should be adjusted.\nMinimum Support Price\n\nMSP is the minimum price that the government pays for the farmers\u2019 produce at the time of procurement. It is aimed at saving the crops from price fluctuations in the market.\n\nThe MSP fixed by the government is considered as being remunerative for farmers.\n\nHowever, MSPs do not have legal backing.\n\nMSPs were first introduced in 1966-67 when the country adopted Green Revolution technologies. To boost domestic production and encourage farmers to plant high-yielding varieties, the government resorted to MSP. A minimum support price was guaranteed to them.\n\nTo read more about MSPs, click here\n\nConclusion\n\nThe fact that the agriculture industry, which accounts for greater than 40% of employment, only contributes 16\u201317% of GDP highlights the difficulties and issues that farmers must deal with. The government\u2019s goal of doubling farmer income by 2022 is therefore achieved with the aid of farm subsidies, which also aid India in achieving double-digit growth by assuring food security.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

No, but rather a conglomerate of goods and services drawn from numerous other industries.\n\nHealthy ageing is \u201cthe process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables wellbeing in older age,\u201d according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe Report of the World Assembly on Ageing, also known as \u201cthe International Plan on Ageing,\u201d was published in 1982 and served as the first international discussion of older people\u2019s rights and provided a strategy for enacting those rights.\n\nThe Second World Assembly\u2019s \u201cMadrid International Plan\u201d on ageing, which was adopted in 2002, was given to the UNPF to carry out.\n\nAgeing:\n\nAgeing is a continuous, irreversible, and universal process that begins at conception and lasts until a person dies.\nAccording to the National Elderly Policy, people 60 and older are considered elderly.\nThe age breakdown of the Indian population is as follows: 0-14: 30.8%, 15-59: 60.3%, 60+: 8.6%.\nAccording to the 2011 Population Census, India has close to 104 million elderly people.\nIt increased from 5.5% in 1951 to 8.6% in 2011.\nIn terms of the elderly population, more than 73 million people, or 71% of the population, live in rural areas, while 31 million people, or 29% of the elderly population, live in urban areas.\n\nAlso, read the article on the topic of ageing India.\n\nChallenges associated with old age\n\nThere are multiple challenges associated with them and can be grouped into social, financial and health.\n\nSocial\nThe intergenerational ties that were the defining feature of the traditional family are weakening as a result of the erosion and adaptation of traditional values and institutions.\nNegligence by kids towards their old parents.\nDisillusionment due to retirement.\nFeeling of powerlessness, loneliness, uselessness, and isolation in the elderly.\nFinancial\nRetirement and dependence of elderly on their child for necessities.\nThe elderly, who are typically poor and in distress when living alone or with just their spouse, are negatively impacted by the emigration of young people of working age from rural areas.\n78% of the elderly are neither receiving a pension nor expected to receive one.\nHealth\nMultiple disabilities among the elders in old age.\nOne in two elderly people has a chronic illness.

What are its positive and negative impacts? Scroll down the page to know more about the effects of liberalization on the Indian economy.\n\nAny process of a state removing limitations on some private individual activity is known as liberalization. Liberalization has taken place when formerly prohibited items are no longer prohibited or when government regulations are loosened.\n\nIt removes governmental involvement and increases the autonomy of commercial firms. It refers to a government loosening previously enacted limits on economic or social policies. Deregulation of the industrial sector, banking sector changes, tax reforms, and reforms to the foreign exchange market all contributed to India\u2019s liberalization.\n\nThen what is Economic liberalization?

Those who support economic liberalism, commonly known as proponents of free markets and free trade, are typically those who advance it. Taxes, social security contributions, and unemployment compensation are frequently decreased as a result of economic liberalization.\n\nWhen did economic reforms begin in India?\n\nIndia began a sequence of economic reforms on July 23, 1991, in response to a fiscal and balance-of-payments (BoP) crisis. The historic reforms would fundamentally alter the character and structure of the economy in the years to come.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat were the measures taken by the Indian government to start economic reforms?\n\nIndia started an economic reform initiative that included two groups of measures:\n\nMacroeconomic stabilization measures: All economic measures, both local and foreign, that aim to increase the economy\u2019s overall demand are referred to as macroeconomic stabilization measures. The creation of quality and well-paying jobs must be prioritized in order to increase the purchasing power of the general public and support the increased domestic demand.\nMeasures for Structural Reform: It encompasses all policy changes that the government has made to increase the overall supply of goods and services in the economy. Naturally, this involves releasing the economy\u2019s restrictions so that it can explore its own potential for increased productivity and output.\n\nLet us discuss what the objectives of liberalization are.\n\nAlso read: History of Banking in India\n\nObjectives of Liberalization\nTo promote the involvement of private Indian businesses and multinational corporations.\nTo enable the Indian economy\u2019s internationalization.\nPromote foreign trade in the nation to boost exports.\nTo resolve the balance of payments crisis facing India.\nTo increase the private sector\u2019s involvement in the growth of India\u2019s economy.\nto boost foreign direct investment in the Indian industry.\nTo encourage domestic enterprises to compete with one another.\nLiberalization Policies\n\nThe policies of liberalization which helps in the growth of the economy are:\n\nDeregulation of the Industrial Sector\nFinancial Sector Reforms\nTax Reforms\nForeign Exchange Reforms\nTrade and Investment Policy Reforms\nExternal Sector Reforms\nForeign Exchange Reforms\nForeign Trade Policy Reforms\n\nThe economic repercussions of liberalization on both the country and investors might be significant.\n\nEconomic liberalization means that a nation \u201copens up\u201d to the rest of the world in terms of commerce, rules, taxes, and other areas that generally have an impact on domestic business.\n\nIt has many impacts on the Indian economy. Let us discuss them.\n\nAlso read: Unified Payment Interface (UPI): Made Simple\n\nImpacts of liberalization on the Indian economy\nImpact on the rate of GDP growth\n\nIndia\u2019s 6.6% annual average growth rate from 1990 to 2010 is almost twice as high as it was before the country\u2019s economic reforms.\n\nTaking Down Obstacles to International Investment\n\nWhen a country has many barriers to entry, investing in emerging market nations can occasionally seem unattainable. These obstacles can include tax policies, prohibitions on foreign investment, legal concerns, and accounting requirements, all of which make entry into the nation difficult or impossible.\n\nThese restrictions are loosened as part of the economic liberalization process, and some private sector influence over the economy\u2019s direction is given up. Frequently, deregulation and the privatization of businesses are involved.\n\nRate of Industrial Growth\n\nDue to unfettered access to Indian markets, indigenous products are no longer competitive. Of course, they had more access to technology and scale economies.\n\nUnrestricted Capital Flow\n\nThe main objectives of economic liberalization are the effective distribution of resources and competitive advantages, as well as the free flow of capital between states. Usually, this is accomplished by lowering protectionist measures like tariffs, trade regulations, and other trade barriers.\n\nIt becomes less expensive for businesses to access capital from investors due to the increased capital flow into the nation. Higher growth rates are the result of corporations being able to invest in profitable ventures that they might not have been able to before liberalization due to a higher cost of capital.\n\nImpact on India\u2019s Small-Scale Sector\n\nAfter independence, the government made an effort to revitalize the small-scale industry by reserving goods solely for its manufacture. The list of restricted commodities was significantly reduced as a result of liberalization, and many new industries were made accessible to large corporations.\n\nHowever, there is still a small-scale sector that supports the Indian economy. It significantly impacts exports and private-sector employment. The results are conflicting, although many once small-scale industries have grown and improved. Although they only exist because of government backing, overall value addition, product innovation, and technology adoption continue to be poor.\n\nOutcomes in Agriculture\n\nAgriculture now only accounts for 15% of the national economy. However, the percentage of people who depend on agriculture is still about 55%. Although there has been a significant change in crop patterns, the effects of liberalization cannot be accurately quantified. We learned through the agricultural television programs that there are still a lot of pervasive government regulations and interventions, from the point of production to the point of distribution.\n\nThe agricultural economy worldwide is severely distorted. This is mostly due to the unequal economic and political power distribution between farmers in industrialized and developing nations. Commercial, capitalist agriculture is practiced in industrialized nations and is controlled by large agribusiness conglomerates. They have easy access to WTO policies and can simply negotiate better terms for themselves at the expense of farmers in poor countries.\nOn the plus side, India\u2019s high-quality, distinctive products\u2014like basmati rice\u2014are virtually self-sufficient and in high demand worldwide. In general, India is better equipped to tackle the challenges of globalization in this situation. If implemented in a fair and sustainable way, it will have a significant multiplier effect on the entire economy.\nIn addition to this, Farm Mechanization\u2014the use of tractors, combines, electronic/solar pumps, etc.\u2014is another benefit of globalization. Moving on, information technology is now being applied in agriculture to simplify farming.\nResult for the Services Sector\nIn this instance, globalization has benefited poor nations while harming industrialized ones. Human resources have historically been substantially more affordable in developing economies because of historical economic inequality between the two groups.\nThe IT revolution helped to expedite this even more, and as a result, many jobs left developed countries and moved to poor nations.\nThe growth of the information technology, software, BPO, KPO, and LPO industries in India has prevented a large portion of the country\u2019s demographic dividend from being wasted. The best thing is that exporting services results in high-value exports.\nThe only product that gets exported is professional labour, which doesn\u2019t diminish with time but actually increases. India is now better positioned to develop into a true knowledge economy.\nThe majority of India\u2019s foreign exchange gains come from the export of these services. In actuality, only during the three years 2000\u20132002 did India have a current account surplus.\nBanking\n\nAdditionally, India has benefited in the banking sector. There have been three rounds of licence grants for private banks since the reforms. Private banks like ICICI, HDFC, and Yes Bank, as well as foreign institutions, increased the bar for the Indian banking sector. The banking sector is now more competitive, and public sector banks are more customer-focused. Similarly, the insurance sector currently provides a wide range of products, including Unit Linked Insurance Plans and Travel Insurance.\n\nStock exchanges\nStock markets are a key development as well. Corporate Securities can be traded in real-time on stock exchanges.\nIt offers methods for ongoing price discovery as well as flexible exit and entry points for investors. These are the foundation of free markets today, and there is active trading taking place on stock exchanges around the globe. Their significance can be gauged by the fact that stock market performance is the best predictor of an economy\u2019s current state and future potential.\nA comprehensive range of related services, including Investment Banking, Asset Management, Underwriting Services, Hedging Advice, etc., have been made available by these markets. In total, these support lakhs of jobs across India.\nSimilar to stock markets, commodities markets offer opportunities for buying and selling a variety of permissible commodities.\nTelecom Sector\nTraditionally, the telecom industry was a monopoly owned by the government, which led to very poor service. Private telecom industry success peaked after reforms. Indian telecom firms also expanded internationally. However, this sector\u2019s growth and outlook were harmed by corruption and rent-seeking.\nModern Direct to Home services led to increases in television service quality on the one hand and the demise of many local cable companies on the other.\nSectors of Education and Health\nIndia has had access to top-notch education, and deregulation has led to the mushrooming of private engineering and medical colleges. In actuality, though, society as a whole was devastated.\nOnly a very small percentage of applicants are accommodated by these new universities, and they are exceedingly expensive.\nTransparency International, an independent group, recently published a report alleging that India\u2019s healthcare system is the most corrupt in the entire world.\nMany students must borrow money from banks to pay for their education due to the high cost of tuition. The majority of them are unable to find employment after qualifying. Practice ends up being the last recourse. Now, a person gets seduced by corruption in order to maintain a respectable standard of living and repay loans. As a result, when numerous instances of the same type are combined, a corrupt system, economy, and society result.\nThe truth is that after deregulation and liberalization, the government withdrew its support from social sectors along with other sectors. There are now affordable solutions in the private sector that range in quality from mediocre to excellent. Less than Mediocre to Mediocre alternatives are accessible in the public sector. This still remains a sizable population of future students and patients.\nAdvantages of liberalization in India\nFreely flowing Capital: Liberalization has boosted the flow of funding by making it more inexpensive for all types of businesses to access capital from investors and to have a successful project.\nInvestor diversity: As a result of liberalization, investors are now able to place a significant amount of their capital in a variety of assets.\nImpact on agriculture: Liberalization had a favorable effect on agriculture. The cropping patterns and designs have undergone significant alteration. Before the agricultural sector was liberalized, the government imposed limitations on everything from the beginning of crop production to its distribution.\nEconomic laws that are relaxed result in a rise in the value of the stock market, which improves investor trading.\nNegative impacts of liberalization\nEconomic instability: Due to the drastic changes that were made in the political and economic spheres, there was economic instability. Indian liberalization\u2019s unfavorable effects include the decline of the economy. The massive return of political-economic power will undermine India\u2019s whole economy.\nImpact of technology: Due to rapid development and innovation in technology, many small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and other firms in emerging nations are able to adapt to the changes or even close their doors.\nAcquisitions and mergers: A lot of tiny firms have amalgamated with big businesses. Numerous smaller businesses faced increased competition from powerful global corporations.\u00a0 Because of this, workers in small industries might need to develop their abilities and adopt new technologies. Employee inefficiency and a strain on the company\u2019s resources may result from time.\nConclusion\n\nEconomic liberalization started in 1991 in India by reviving economic policies, with the goal of creating an economy more market-oriented and increasing the role of private and foreign investment.\n\nSelf-reliance and a lack of R&D spending served as roadblocks to technological advancement, which resulted in the manufacture of items of lower quality. In Indian society, there is still a strong assumption that imported items are preferable to domestic ones. It is widely accepted that, before assessing the success of the ongoing industrial policy, consideration must be given to the state of the country following two centuries of exploitation and a horrific separation.\n\nMany factors like lack of tactical skills, low literacy levels, unskilled labor, and absence of technology were significant aspects of the Indian economy before independence. It is stated that industrial strategies, policies, and their restoration are essential for a nation\u2019s economy to thrive.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas",

India has a highly favorable climate for agro-products such as fruits, vegetables, spices, and aromatic plants.\n\nThe horticulture sector in India produces around 320 million tons of products and contributes about 33% of the Gross Value Addition (GVA).\n\nIt is a labour-intensive sector and thus provides a lot of employment opportunities, especially for the people of rural regions.\n\nHorticulture has implemented cutting-edge methods that have enhanced productivity and export potential, leading to further expansion.\n10% of the land in India is used for horticulture, which accounts for 33% of the agricultural value.\n\nIndia has advantageous topographical characteristics that promote the development of a wide range of vegetables.\n\nVegetables of more than 40 different varieties are produced throughout India. Vegetable production in India is second in the world.\n\nMore than 10% of the world\u2019s fruit production is produced in India.\n\nThe majority of fruit is produced in Indian states like Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.\n\nIn some parts of the country, the favourable climate encourages the production of a wide range of flowers all year long.\n\nThe demand for flowers among the upper and middle classes for aesthetic purposes has increased, which has aided in the development of floriculture as a thriving industry.\nGrowth of horticulture in India\n\nBetween 2004\u20132005 and 2019\u201320, the productivity of horticultural crops increased by 38% in India.\n\nBecause horticulture products are more resistant to changing weather conditions, their production is economical and practical.\n\nThe requirement of area, water, and other resources are much less than other agricultural products and hence reduce the chance of failure thereby giving better returns and income opportunities.\n\nInitiatives by the Government of India\n\nMIDH and CDP are two major initiatives of the Government of India in connection with Horticulture.\n\nThe Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH)\nIt was implemented in 2014.\nIt is a centrally sponsored scheme with a focus on devising plans and processes to facilitate horticulture production efficiently and cost-effectively.\nThe government of India sponsors 60% of the total developmental expenditure incurred by different states and 40% is contributed by state governments.\nFor North-Indian states, the government contribution is 90%.\nThrough the use of region-specific strategies and action plans, the primary goals of this programme are to assure the overall expansion of the horticulture industry.\nResearch, technology adaptation and application, harvest management, transportation, storage, processing, and marketing are a few of the different activities.\nIt focuses on enhancing productivity through the use of superior planting materials and cutting-edge irrigation systems while taking into account the various agro-climatic characteristics of various places.\nThe programme promotes the growth of local youth\u2019s skills and their involvement in horticultural production, which creates job possibilities.\nTo increase volume and cost-effectiveness, the growers who are active in horticulture production are grouped.\nIt has five major schemes for horticulture:\nNational Horticulture Mission (NHM)\nHorticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan States (HMNEH)\nNational Horticulture Board (NHB)\nCoconut Development Board (CDB)\nCentral Institute of Horticulture (CIH), Nagaland\nHorticulture Cluster Development Programme (CDP)\nIt is a\u00a0central sector programme\u00a0aimed at growing and developing identified horticulture clusters to make them globally competitive.\nThe horticulture cluster is a regional/geographical concentration of targeted horticulture crops.\nThe National Horticulture Board (NHB) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare is responsible for carrying it out.\nThe list of 55 clusters will also include the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, Manipur, Mizoram, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, etc., identified with their primary/focus crops.\nTo increase the competitiveness of cluster crops, the CDP seeks to increase exports of targeted crops by around 20% and develop cluster-specific trademarks.\nIt aims to deal with all important horticulture-related challenges, such as pre-production, production, post-harvest management, logistics, marketing, and branding.\nIt plans to encourage horticulture clusters\u2019 integrated and market-driven growth by leveraging geographical specialization.\nIt also aims to coordinate with other government programmes like the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund.\nThrough CDP, significant investment will also be made in the horticultural industry.\nFuture of horticulture in India\n\nSome future targets to improve the horticulture sector in India are:\n\nImport of technologies to boost the horticultural industry\u2019s productivity and skill development.\napplication of organic farming practices in horticulture to produce goods with positive environmental and financial effects.\nAdoption of more standardized horticulture production procedures that aid farmers in using their knowledge and abilities to increase production.\nMore private companies\u2019 involvement in the horticulture industry may increase productivity and open up new export markets.\nThe government should encourage farms with incentives and offer assistance as they transition from conventional to organic farming to increase the development of organic horticulture.\nOffering certificates, incentivize farmers to follow Good Agriculture Practices (GAP).\n\nThese methods aid in the production of fruits and vegetables that are of higher quality. In turn, this will increase demand from other countries and boost export activity.\n\nOn-field projections:\nAccording to projections, the area devoted to horticulture will grow 2.7% in FY21 compared to FY20.\nAccording to estimates, horticulture production will increase by 5.8 mt in FY21 compared to FY20.\nThe agriculture ministry has chosen 10 indigenous fruit crops and 10 fruit varieties that are widely consumed.\nTo meet India\u2019s anticipated 650 mt of fruit and vegetable demand by 2050, there is room to increase productivity.\nConclusion\n\nAs a diverse agricultural function, the horticulture industry has grown to be a promising source of employment possibilities.\n\nIt helps ensure both the sector\u2019s and the economy\u2019s continuous growth. India has developed into a top producer of horticulture goods and has become a dependable source for the creation of jobs, income, and export promotion.\n\nWith the aid of better resource allocation, infrastructure development, technical advancement, and better policy implementation for the development of the horticulture industry, India is anticipated to attain a significant position in the global forum.\n\nMaking a deliberate effort to put specific strategies into action would help the horticulture industry expand and thrive in the future.\n\nRead:\u00a0Cocoa cultivation in India;\u00a0Spices Sector in India\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

The economy of the country benefited from this.\n\nIndia was one of the world\u2019s top producers of tea by the 1850s. Local tea brands were made available to the general public as a beverage following independence.\n\nAfter the Charter Act of 1833, the East India Company lost its trade monopoly with China. The Tea Committee was established in 1834, under William Bentinck, the then Governor-General of India.\n\nAn interesting fact about Tea gardens in Assam is that they do not follow Indian Standard Time (IST). The local time in Assam\u2019s tea gardens, known as \u201cTea Garden Time\u201d or\u00a0Bagantime, is an hour ahead of the IST.

It started functioning in 1954.\n\nThe board is located in Kolkata and has 17 offices across India. Being the regulatory body, the Board exerts control over the producers, manufacturers, exporters, tea brokers, auction organizers, and warehouse keepers through various control orders notified under Tea Act.\n\nThe responsibilities of the board are increasing production and productivity, improving the quality of tea, market promotion, and welfare measures for plantation workers, and supporting Research and Development.\n\nChallenges faced by the tea industry\n\nSome issues prevent this sector from developing to its full potential. Over the previous ten years, production expenses have increased at a rate twice as fast as prices.\n\nOverproduction is currently the biggest issue the Indian tea sector is dealing with. The total amount of tea produced in India cannot be consumed by domestic and worldwide demand.\nChina produces a lot of black tea which is not consumed domestically. China is therefore making an effort to push to sell the whole quantity of extra black tea. Indian tea exports may be at risk as a result of this.\nSince tea now has a six-digit code, India no longer serves as the place of origin after some value addition, which poses another danger to Indian export. After some slight value addition, the new product re-enters the Indian market.\nA huge number of small-scale, unorganized tea farmers are present.\nUntapped tea tourism has immense potential, but it needs a boost.\n\nAlso read: Coffee Industry In India\n\nWay forward\n\nThe Indian tea industry has many chances to develop further due to the sheer magnificence of the production capacity and because it employs so many people in the northeastern regions.\n\nThe main necessity for a highly labor-centric business like tea plantations is a fully sustainable and transparent model which balances the organic and modernization approach well.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ.

Increased demand from several applications and rising consumer demand for high-quality cooking and edible oils are driving the global market for cooking oils. Read here to know more about the edible oil economy.\n\nIndia is one of the largest producers of oilseeds in the world and this sector occupies an important position in the agricultural economy.\n\nIndia accounts for the estimated production of 36.56 million tons of nine cultivated oilseeds during the year 2020-21(November-October) as per the 3rd\u00a0Advance Estimates released by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2021.\n\nBy boosting the production and productivity of oilseeds and oil palm and minimizing the import of edible oils, India expects to increase the availability of these oils, reaching self-sufficiency while conserving vital foreign exchange for other necessary imports.\n\nThe global edible oil market is expected to grow by 10.28% annually for the next 5 years.

Import of edible oils is under Open General License (OGL).\n\nTo harmonize the interests of farmers, processors, and consumers, Government reviews the duty structure of edible oils from time to time.\n\nFrom 2018, the import duty on all crude and refined edible oils, except Palm oil and Olive oil was raised to 35% and 45% respectively while the import duty on Olive oil was increased to 40%.\nIn 2020, the import duty on Crude and Refined Palm Oil was revised to 37.5% and 45% respectively.\nIn 2020, the import policy of Refined Palm Oil is amended from \u2018free\u2019 to the \u2018Restricted\u2019 category.\nIn 2020, the import duty on crude palm oil was revised from 37.5% to 27.5%.\nGovernment initiatives\n\nYellow Revolution\u00a0was launched to increase the production of Edible oilseeds in the country to meet domestic demand.\n\nThe government of India launched National Mission on Edible Oils-Oil Palm as a centrally-sponsored scheme, being implemented jointly by the central and state governments with a special focus on the northeast region and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nTo improve and systemize the data management system in the vegetable oil sector, the Directorate of Sugar & Vegetable Oils under the Department of Food and Public Distribution has developed a web-based platform for the online submission of inputs by vegetable oil producers on monthly basis.\n\nThis has helped the Government to take prompt and informed policy decisions for better management of the vegetable oil sector.\nThe new system also provides transparency in the data management of the vegetable oil industry as well as the Government\u2019s work.\nThe portal also provides a window for online registration and submission of monthly production returns.\n\nTo achieve self-sufficiency in the production of oilseeds, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has adopted a multi-pronged strategy.\n\nUnder the strategy, the Government of India had approved an ambitious plan for the free distribution of high-yielding varieties of seeds to the farmers for the Kharif season 2021 in the form of mini-kits.\nNews about edible oil\nRecently, GM mustard was cleared by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee for field trials and environmental release.\nThe central government told the Supreme Court that the deployment of GM Mustard hybrids will contribute to India\u2019s self-sustenance in the production of edible oil and shall go a long way in realizing the vision of \u201cAtmanirbhar Bharat\u201d.\nThe government added that opposing it will hurt farmers, consumers, and industry.\nPrevious year question\n\nConsider the following statements: (2018)\n\nThe quantity of imported edible oils is more than the domestic production of edible oils in the last five years.\nThe Government does not impose any customs duty on all imported edible oils as a special case.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n\n(a)\u00a01 only\n(b)\u00a02 only\n(c)\u00a0Both 1 and 2\n(d)\u00a0Neither 1 nor 2\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

This would improve the soil\u2019s health.\n\nThe MRP of phosphoric and potassium (P&K) fertilizers can be fixed at appropriate levels by manufacturers, marketers, and importers thanks to the Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme (NBS).\n\nThe country\u2019s inventory levels, currency exchange rates, and domestic and international fertilizer costs are all taken into account while determining the MRP.\n\nThe NBS does not include urea-based fertilizers and is available for imported complex fertilizers except Ammonium Sulphate.\n\nFertilizer Subsidy Scheme 2022\n\nThe Fertilizer Subsidy Scheme is a centrally funded scheme launched in April 2022.\n\nIt is operated and maintained by the Department of Fertilizers.\nThe tagline of this scheme is PROSPEROUS FARMER, PROSPEROUS INDIA.\nIts main objective is to provide Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) rates for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) fertilizers to the farmers.\nAt present, it is a short-term scheme for only Kharif Season.\n\nFertilizers Subsidy Scheme 2022 allows farmers to buy fertilizer bags at very low rates in comparison to the rates in the market.\n\nIn this scheme, the government will provide subsidies for the purchase of Phosphatic and Potassic (P & K) Fertilizers to the farmers.\n\nThis will help the farmers to procure the required quantity of fertilizers for their agricultural fields.\n\nUnder this scheme, farmers will directly get subsidized fertilizers at the government-managed Sehkari Store.\nFarmers will only have to pay the subsidized amount of fertilizers\nConcerns with the Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme\n\nBecause urea isn\u2019t included in the plan, its price is still under control as the Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme has only been applied to other fertilizers.\n\nTechnically, there is no price regulation for other fertilizers. Farmers are now using more urea than previously because of the increased cost of other deregulated fertilizers.\nThe imbalance in fertilizer as a result has gotten worse.\n\nThe NBS policy is not only harming the fiscal state of the economy but is also proving harmful to the soil health of the nation.\n\nFertilizer subsidies are the second-largest subsidy after food subsidies.\n\nSubsidized urea is being diverted to large purchasers, traders, or even non-agricultural consumers like plywood manufacturers and producers of animal feed.\n\nIndia\u2019s agrochemical usage is quite high and almost 55% of it is urea.\n\nThe Centre provides a subsidy for urea fertilizer based on the cost of manufacturing at each facility. Manufacturers of fertilizers are required to sell them.\nNBS Scheme in news\nThe Union Cabinet has approved the proposal of the Department of Fertilizers for per Kilogram rates of Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) for various Nutrients that is Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potash (K), and Sulphur (S) for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) fertilizers for Rabi Season 2022-23\n\nThis will enable the smooth availability of all P&K fertilizers to the farmers during Rabi 2022-23 at the subsidized / affordable prices of fertilizers and support the agriculture sector.\n\nThe volatility in the international prices of fertilizers and raw materials has been primarily absorbed by the Union Government.\n\nWay forward\n\nUrea must be included by the Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme to redress the imbalance in fertilizer use.\n\nA workable solution would be to raise the price of urea while concurrently lowering the NBS rates for phosphate, potash, and sulfur to lower the cost of other fertilizers.\n\nGiven that all three nutrients-nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) are essential for boosting crop yields and produce quality, the government must adopt a standard policy for all fertilizers.\n\nA flat per-acre cash subsidy that may be used to buy any fertilizer should eventually take the place of NBS.\n\nThis subsidy must cover goods with added value and customization that deliver nitrogen more effectively than urea while also including other nutrients.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish",

One of them is to publish two reports every year. One is, the Annual Report, and the other is the Report on Trends and Progress of Banking in India.\n\nRBI conducts Consumer Confidence Survey and Inflation Expectation Survey every quarter.\n\nKey Features Related to the Functions of RBI\nRBI is authorized to issue various guidelines for bank directors and has the power to appoint additional directors to the board of a banking company.\nPrior approval of RBI is important for the appointment, reappointment, and termination of the Chairman, Managing Director, and CEO of Commercial Banks (except PSBs).\nIf the situation arises then RBI with the approval of the Central Government can take the place of the Board of Directors of Commercial Banks.\nPublic Sector Banks (PSBs) come under dual regulation of the Central Government and RBI so the RBI\u2019s power regarding the PSBs is curtailed as it cannot remove the directors and management and cannot supersede the board of Banks also cannot enforce mergers.\nAs per RBI\u2019s regulation, Banks needed to maintain certain reserves in the form of CRR and SLR.\nRBI regulates the interest rate on NRI deposits, export credits (loans), and a few other categories. However, the interest rate on most of the categories of deposit and lending have been deregulated so the banks are responsible for determining such rates.\nRBI set up the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) for the protection of the interest of small depositors in case of bank failure or bankruptcy (100% subsidy). It provides insurance cover to all eligible bank depositors up to 5 lakhs per depositor per bank. To provide insurance coverage, it charges premiums from banks. DICGC covers all commercial banks including foreign bank branches as well along with UCBs/StCBs/DCCBs. However, it is important to note that it does not cover deposits of foreign governments, deposits of Central and State governments, and interbank deposits.\nRBI has permitted the banks to undertake some non-traditional banking activities such as venture capital, insurance, mutual fund business, etc.\nCooperative Banks- Cooperative Banks come under the dual regulation of RBI and the Government. Both the authorities have different fields to work on as RBI manages the banking-related functions and the Central Government or State Government manages the management-related functions.\nFinancial Institutions, NBFCs, Primary Dealers, and Credit Information Companies (CIC)- The four all-India financial institutions named NABARD, NHB, EXIM Bank, and SIDBI are under full-fledged regulation and supervision of RBI.\nNBFCs, Primary Dealers and CICs also come under the regulation and supervision of RBI.\nNote: RBI is authorized to regulate banks and NBFCs but till July 2019, RBI had the power to take the place of the Board of Banks (in case of any mismanagement or default) but not of NBFCs. In July 2019 an amendment was made to the RBI Act 1934 that empowers the RBI to supersede the bank of NBFCs also in case of mismanagement or default. RBI now has the power to appoint administrators as well in the public interest.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Payments made in cash are an example of direct subsidies in India. Tax breaks and premium-free insurance are examples of indirect subsidies.\n\nThe purpose of the subsidy is often to alleviate some sort of hardship. It is frequently thought to be in the interest of the public to provide to promote a social good or economic policy.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypes of Subsidies\nOther types\nHow do subsidies affect our budgetary resources?\nThe rationale behind providing subsidies\nDisadvantages\nConclusion\nTypes of Subsidies\n\nThere are six primary categories of subsidies as follows, divided by purpose. They are as follows:\n\nExport subsidies \u2013 Subsidies given on exports.\nSubsidies contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods \u2013 To promote domestic goods from the cheaper imported goods.\nIndustrial promotion subsidies \u2013 To promote certain industries.\nStructural adjustment subsidies \u2013 To adjust or compensate for the structural deficiencies in an economy.\nRegional development subsidies \u2013 It is given for the development of a particular region.\nResearch and development subsidies \u2013 To promote research and development.\nBy beneficiary, there are two primary categories \u2013\nSubsidies that are not limited to specific businesses or industries (non-specific subsidies).\nSubsidies that are limited to specific businesses and industries (specific subsidies).\nOther types\nProduct subsidy \u2013 Subsidies on products are payments made per unit of a produced article or service. A product subsidy is usually due when the good is manufactured, sold, or imported, but it may also be due when the good is transferred, leased, delivered, or utilized for one\u2019s consumption or capital development.\nProduction subsidy \u2013 The purpose of production subsidies is to increase the production of a specific good such that the market would support it without increasing the final cost to consumers.\nConsumer/Consumption subsidies \u2013 These reduce the price of goods and services to the consumer.\nGovernment subsidies \u2013 The government offers subsidies in a variety of types. Welfare payments and unemployment compensation are two of the most prevalent forms of individual subsidies. The main goal of these subsidies is to assist those who are momentarily experiencing financial hardship.\n\nFurther subsidies are provided to encourage people to pursue higher education and subsidized interest rates on student loans.\n\nHow do subsidies affect our budgetary resources?\n\nIndia is a developing nation, thus there aren\u2019t many budgetary resources available to expand the reach of subsidies to a larger population.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe amount of food subsidy in the government budget is Rs. 2.06 lakh crore, or around 1.9% of GDP in 2018\u201319 and 2.5% in 2019\u20132020.\n\nFrom 2010\u201311 to 2019\u201320, or roughly the narrow range of 18.4% to 20.3%, the revenue to GDP ratio has been stagnant for a considerable amount of time.\n\nThe ratio is much higher in many developed and emerging market economies. These ratios for the UK and the USA in 2019 were 36% and 30.1%, for Sweden and the Netherlands they were 48.6% and 43.6%, and for Brazil, it was 31.5%.\n\nAlso, Read\u00a0Direct Benefit Transfer;\u00a0Freebies politics,\u00a0Nutrients based subsidy scheme\n\nThe rationale behind providing subsidies\n\nPublic subsidies can be justified for a variety of reasons: some are political, others are economic, and some are based on socioeconomic development theory. According to development theory, some businesses require protection from outside competition to maximize domestic advantage.\n\nA free market economy is technically devoid of subsidies; adding one turns it into a mixed economy. The value of subsidies and, by extension, the degree to which an economy should be mixed are topics of frequent discussion among economists and decision-makers.\n\nSubsidies in India are provided for a variety of reasons, and they play a significant role in the country\u2019s economic and social policies. These subsidies are designed to address various economic, social, and political objectives.\n\nPoverty Alleviation: Subsidies are often used as a means of poverty alleviation. They aim to provide essential goods and services at lower prices to economically disadvantaged sections of the population, making them more accessible and affordable.\nFood Security: The government provides food subsidies to ensure food security for the population. The Public Distribution System (PDS) is a prominent example where essential food items are distributed to the poor at subsidized rates.\nAgriculture Support: Subsidies are extended to the agriculture sector to support farmers and enhance agricultural productivity. These subsidies can include fertilizers, seeds, and credit facilities.\nFuel Subsidies: Subsidies on fuels, particularly cooking gas and kerosene, are aimed at providing energy at lower costs to households, especially in rural and economically disadvantaged areas.\nEducation and Healthcare: The government offers subsidies in the education and healthcare sectors to make quality education and healthcare more accessible to the masses. This includes subsidized education in government schools and colleges and affordable healthcare services in public health facilities.\nExport Promotion: Subsidies are often provided to boost exports by making Indian products more competitive in international markets. This can include export incentives and tax benefits for exporters.\nSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): Subsidies are given to support the growth and development of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are crucial for economic growth and job creation.\nEnvironmental Conservation: Some subsidies are introduced to encourage environmentally friendly practices. For instance, incentives may be provided to promote the use of clean energy sources or the adoption of eco-friendly technologies.\nSocial Welfare: Subsidies are also used for social welfare programs, including cash transfers to vulnerable populations, maternity benefits, and other forms of financial support.\nIndustrial Development: Subsidies may be offered to encourage the growth of specific industries or to attract investment in certain regions, to boost economic development and employment opportunities.\nPrice Stabilization: Subsidies are sometimes used to stabilize prices of essential commodities. For example, subsidies on cooking gas can help maintain stable prices for consumers.\nPolitical Popularity: In a democratic context, governments may use subsidies to gain political support and popularity, especially during elections.\nDisadvantages\nAlthough an increased supply of commodities is one benefit of subsidies, a lack of supply is also a possibility. This is so that manufacturers won\u2019t have to work as hard to fulfill a sudden increase in demand that can result from lower prices. In the end, it may result in extremely strong demand, which raises prices.\nOften, subsidies are efficient and beneficial. The situation would be different if the government released a report on how well it had used subsidies. This is due to the difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of subsidies.\nHow will the government raise money to support industry subsidies? Naturally, by levying larger taxes. Therefore, the general public and businesses are the ones who give the resources needed for the government to subsidize industry.\n\nGovernments utilize several tools in their toolbox, including subsidies, to accomplish various policy objectives.\n\nFrom the standpoint of sustainable development, it is essential to address the negative externalities of subsidies while maintaining their market-correcting role and the policy space for development. This is because the world is becoming more interdependent.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that subsidies in India, while aimed at providing support and benefits, can also pose challenges, such as fiscal burdens, inefficiencies, and leakages. To address these challenges, the government has initiated reforms to rationalize and target subsidies more effectively, including the use of digital platforms for direct benefit transfers. Subsidy policies are subject to periodic review and adjustment to ensure they meet their intended objectives while minimizing distortions in the economy.\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR",

It has several components that are explained in detail in this article.\n\nIn India, there are primarily two types of financial institutions: Banks and Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs).\n\nThe main distinction between a bank and an NBFI is that banks accept demand deposits, whereas NBFIs do not.

These are essentially private banks with foreign ownership.\n\nRegional Rural Banks (RRB)\n\nUnder the provisions of the Regional Rural Banks Act of 1976, Regional Rural Banks were created in 1975 with the goal of boosting the rural economy by offering loans and other facilities, particularly to small and marginal farmers, agricultural laborers, artisans, and small businesses owners, for the growth of agriculture, trade, commerce, industry, and other productive activities in rural areas.\n\nRRBs are held by the Central government, the concerned State government, and the sponsor bank in the proportion of 50:15:35.\nEach RRB is sponsored by a particular bank.\nRRBs need to provide 75% of the lending to priority sectors. RRBs are under the supervision of NABARD.\nPayment Banks\n\nIn August 2015, RBI approved\u00a0licenses to 11 applicants\u00a0as Payment Banks. The RBI has set a limit of Rs. 1 lakh on the amount of deposits that payment banks may accept from one customer. Only businesses that are really committed to serving the underprivileged and poor\u00a0will be able to apply for a payment bank.\n\nTherefore, migrant workers, independent contractors, low-income households, etc. will be the main target of payment banks.\n\nPayment banks are not\u00a0allowed to lend money or issue credit cards. Payment banks will only accept demand deposits i.e.,\u00a0only current and savings account options will be offered.\n\nSmall Finance Banks\nThe RBI awarded licenses to numerous applications for Small Finance Banks in September 2015, which is a step toward advancing financial inclusion.\nThe small finance banks will largely engage in basic banking activities, such as accepting deposits and lending to underserved and unserved groups, such as unorganized sector entities, small business units, small and marginal farmers, and micro and small businesses.\nThere won\u2019t be any limitations on the area\u00a0of operation of\u00a0small financing institutions.\nThe small finance banks must lend 75% of their total credit to sectors that the RBI has designated as priority sectors for lending (PSL).\nIts lending portfolio should consist of at least 50% loans and advances under Rs. 25 lakhs.\n\nA Government of India Scheme announced in 1996 led to the establishment of Local Area Banks (LAB). The purpose of establishing local area banks was to make it possible for local institutions to mobilize rural savings and make them available for investments in the local regions.\n\nAlso read: Microfinance Institutions\n\nCooperative Banks\n\nUnder the Indian Financial System, Urban Co-operative Banks (UCB) and Rural Co-operative Banks are the two subcategories of cooperative banks. UCBs come under the supervision of RBI.\n\nUrban Co-operative Banks\n\nUrban Co-operative Banks, also known as Primary Co-operative Banks, are found in urban and semi-urban regions. They essentially made loans to small enterprises and borrowers. They now have a far wider range of operations.\n\nUCBs are further classified into\u00a0Scheduled and Non-scheduled categories, which are then further divided into single-state and multi-state.\n\nSingle State UCBs are governed by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS) of the state concerned and are\u00a0registered as cooperative societies under the State Government Cooperative Societies Act.\n\nMulti-State UCBs are governed by the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies (CRCS) and are registered as cooperative societies under the requirements of the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act of 2002.\n\nRural Cooperative Banks\n\nIndia\u2019s rural cooperative credit system is primarily responsible for ensuring credit flow to the agricultural sector. Both short-term and long-term cooperative credit systems are included in it.\n\nState Cooperative Banks (StCBs) at the state level, (District) Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) at the district level and Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) at the village level make up the three-tier system that governs the short-term cooperative credit framework.\n\nLong-term cooperative credit systems include the State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Bank (SCARDB) and the Primary Cooperative Agricultural and Rural Development Bank (PCARDB).\n\nAbout Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs)\n\nUnder the Indian Financial System, the Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs) industry is a key sector that is governed and regulated by the RBI.\n\nAll India Financial Institutions (AIFIs), Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and Primary Dealers (PDs) fall under NBFIs in the Indian Financial System.\n\nCredit Information Companies (CIC) are also a category of non-banking financial institutions that are subject to RBI regulation.\n\nAll India Financial Institutions (AIFIs)\n\nAIFIs are an institutional mechanism entrusted with providing sector-specific long-term financing. Currently, the RBI regulates and supervises several AIFIs, also known as Development Financial Institutions (DFIs). Such AIF institutions are mentioned below.\n\nA) NABARD\n\nBy the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development Act of 1981, NABARD was established in 1982.\n\nNABARD offers credit to promote rural areas\u2019 linked economic activities, including small-scale enterprises, cottage industries, handicrafts, and rural crafts.\n\nNABARD oversees and coordinates the activities of rural credit institutions like RRBs\u00a0and Rural Cooperative Banks (RBI has delegated its supervisory powers in the case of the rural sector to NABARD while retaining its regulatory powers)\n\nWhen it comes to issues of rural development, NABARD offers help to the government, RBI, and other organizations.\n\nprovides training and research facilities for banks, cooperatives, and organizations in areas related to rural development.\n\nAlthough it does not offer direct credit to specific individuals, it does offer indirect financial help through refinancing (NABARD finances the organizations that offer financial assistance to the rural sector). Institutions that are approved by the central government may receive direct financing from NABARD.\n\nB) NATIONAL HOUSING BANK (NHB)\n\nUnder the National Housing Bank Act of 1987, NHB was founded in 1988. The main purpose of NHB\u2019s operations is to assist and promote housing finance institutions through financial and other means at both the local and regional levels.\n\nAlthough it does not provide direct credit to individuals, it does provide indirect financial help through refinancing (i.e. NHB finances those institutions that provide finance to individual borrowers, builders, etc.)\n\nC) EXIM BANK\n\nThe Export-Import Bank of India Act of 1981 led to the establishment of the EXIM bank in 1982.\n\nThe goal of the EXIM bank is to help exporters and importers with financial support and serve as the main financial institution for coordinating the operations of institutions engaged in financing the export and import of products and services to promote the nation\u2019s international trade.\n\nIt offers direct financial support to exporters and importers as well as indirect support through refinancing.\n\nD) SMALL INDUSTRIES DEVELOPMENT BANK OF INDIA (SIDBI)\n\nUnder the provisions of the Small Industries Development of India Act 1989, SIDBI was established in 1990.\n\nSIDBI serves as the primary financial institution for the development, financing, and promotion of the Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise (MSME) sector as well as for coordination of the operations of the institutions involved in related activities.\n\nSIDBI primarily provides banking institutions with indirect financial support (via refinancing) to enable them to continue lending to MSMEs.\n\nE) MUDRA BANK\n\nThe Government of India established MUDRA (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) as a financial organization for the development and refinancing of micro-unit firms.\n\nUnder the Indian Financial System, a Non-Banking Finance Company named MUDRA Ltd has been established as a subsidiary of SIDBI.\n\nThe goal of MUDRA is to provide funding to the non-corporate (informal sector) small business sector, including small manufacturing units, store owners, fruit and vegetable vendors, hair salons,\u00a0and craftsmen in both rural and urban areas with financial requirements up to Rs. 10 lakhs.\n\nThere are three different types of MUDRA loans. Loans up to Rs. 50,000 are available for small businesses under the \u201cShishu\u201d category; loans beyond Rs. 50,000 and up to Rs. 5 lakhs are available under the \u201cKishor\u201d category, and loans between Rs. 5 lakhs and Rs. 10 lakhs are available under the \u201cTarun\u201d category.\n\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)\n\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), commonly referred to as Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs), are organizations that offer some financial services that resemble those offered by banks but do not have a banking license.\n\nUnder the Indian Financial System, a non-banking financial company (NBFC) is a company registered under the Companies Act of 1956 that engages in the business of loans and advances, acquisition of shares/stocks/bonds/debentures/securities issued by the government or a local authority or other marketable securities of a like nature, leasing, hire-purchase, insurance business, and chit business.\n\nIt excludes institutions whose main line of business is that of agriculture activity, industrial activity, and the purchase or sale of immovable property.\n\nAccording to the RBI Act of 1934, no NBFC may operate without a certificate of registration from RBI. However, certain kinds of NBFCs that are subject to regulation by other agencies are free from the requirement of registration with the RBI, for example:\n\nVenture Capital Funds, Merchant Banking Institutions, and Stock broking companies registered with SEBI.\nInsurance Company with a current Certificate of Registration by IRDA.\nChit firms, as outlined in the 1982 Chit Funds Act and governed by the respective State governments.\n\nMicro Financial Institutions (MFIs) are also a type of NBFC, however, the amount of credit they can extend is restricted. The upper limit is Rs. 1.25 lakh for those living in rural areas, and Rs. 2 lakhs for those in urban and semi-urban areas.\n\nPrimary Dealers (PDs)\n\nThe RBI has granted primary dealers the right to buy and sell government securities. They are organizations that have registered with the RBI. As RBI releases these government securities on behalf of the government, PDs purchase them directly from the government in the primary market to resell them to other customers in the secondary market. As a result, they are essential in developing the primary and secondary markets for government securities.\n\nPeer to Peer (P2P) Lender\n\nUnder the Indian Financial System, P2P intermediaries are a new class of NBFCs that offer a platform that connects independent lenders and borrowers. P2P lending allows borrowers to borrow money from private investors who are willing to lend their own funds at an agreed interest rate. Social lending or crowd lending are other names for peer-to-peer lending.\n\nThere are limits on how much a lender can lend (up to a total of Rs. 50 lakhs), how much a borrower can borrow, and for how long they can borrow it (limit on period).\n\nserve as an intermediary by offering a platform or online market to those taking part in peer-to-peer lending;\nnot raise\u00a0deposits and not end on its own\nnot offer any sort of credit guarantee\nconduct a thorough investigation of the participants;\ncarry out risk profiling and credit assessment of the borrowers and disclose the information to potential lenders;\nrequire the participant\u2019s prior consent before accessing their credit information;\nprovide aid with loan disbursement and repayment of the amount;\nCredit Information Companies (CIC)\n\nA CIC is an autonomous company that enlists banks, NBFCs, and financial institutions as members. From these members, the CIC collects data and identifying information for specific customers and companies. Based on a prospective borrower\u2019s past payment history, CICS can tell banks whether or not he is creditworthy. The level of information determines how well lenders can assess risk and how easily consumers can get loans at affordable rates.\n\nBy the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act of 2005, the RBI regulates and issues licenses to CICs. TransUnion Credit Information Bureau of India Limited (CIBIL), Equifax, Experian, and High Mark Credit Information Services are the four CICS currently operating in India.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Continue reading to learn more.\n\n\u201cTake, make, use, and Dispose\u201d\u2026We have been adhering to this norm for decades!!!\n\nWe frequently throw away the older models when we want the newest phone or laptop. We throw away our old clothes as our sense of style shifts, and this replacement is extremely typical in all aspects of our lives. However, this inefficient method, known as the linear economy, is bad for the environment.\n\nWe are running out of resources and creating an excessive amount of harmful waste. That is why we must transition to a circular economy, which is motivated by the natural world and in which nothing is wasted.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat exactly is a Linear Economy?\nWhat is a Circular Economy?\nThe Concept is built on three key ideas\n1 .

With things designed to be discarded after use, it puts profit before sustainability.\n\n(According to the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, under the government of India, The nation generates approximately 62 million tons of waste with an average annual growth rate of 4%. It is also found that currently, India generates 70 million metrics of municipal solid wastes. Out of it, only 20% is recycled and the rest ends up in landfills and oceans affecting humans, and marine life, along with destroying the environment. )\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is a Circular Economy?\n\nA circular economy, often known as \u201ccircularity,\u201d is an economic system that addresses issues including pollution, waste, biodiversity loss, and climate change.\nA circular economy emphasizes the 3 R\u2019s (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) as well as material refurbishment, recovery, and repair.\nTherefore, the circular economy is focused on boosting production through resource consumption is more effective and hence has the least negative effect on the environment.\nSustainability serves as the foundation for all aspects of production, consumption, and design.\n\n(It is estimated that waste management in India is potentially a $15 billion industry. Out of the entire waste produced in India,\u00a0 25% are dry waste components that can be recycled. This recyclable waste, dumped into landfills due to a lack of proper collection and infrastructure, can be reused as raw material. If it is properly segregated and processed further, it can be a highly lucrative source of revenue generating)\n\nAlso read:\u00a0 E-waste, Single-use plastics.\n\nThe Concept is built on three key ideas\n1 . REDUCING POLLUTION AND WASTE\n\nThe idea recommends minimizing waste and pollution through minimizing the harm caused by economic activity.\n\n2. EXTENDING THE USABLE LIVES OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS\n\nBy creating loops of resources and products cycling in the economy, a circular economy tries to increase the usable life of the products and materials. The objective is accomplished by actively reusing, repairing, and remanufacturing the goods and resources used in the economy.\n\n3 . NATURAL SYSTEM REGENERATION\n\nOne of the core ideas of a (circular) economy is the regeneration of natural systems. It increases natural capital and establishes the prerequisites for natural systems\u2019 regeneration\n\nAlso read: Landfill Fires: Causes, Mitigation and Management\n\nWhat is a Butterfly Diagram?\n\nThe butterfly diagram, which depicts the circular economy system, demonstrates the constant flow of materials in a circular economy. The technological cycle and the biological cycle are the two main cycles. After completing one or more usage cycles, biological materials\u2014represented by the green cycles on the diagram\u2019s left side\u2014can be safely reintroduced into the natural world, where they will biodegrade over time and release the nutrients they once contained.\n\nTechnical materials, shown in blue on the right side, are prohibited from returning to the environment. For their worth to be recovered and retrieved, these commodities, such as metals, polymers, and synthetic compounds, must be continuously cycled through the system.\n\nIs recycling the same as that of the Circular Economy?\n\nAlthough the two concepts are interconnected, a circular economy is more comprehensive and ambitious.\nIn Recycling, the majority of recyclable goods can only be downcycled, which results in a loss of quality with each subsequent life cycle and eventual waste.\nWithout any fresh material inputs, a circular economy would reduce emissions, waste, and ultimately costs.\u00a0\nA circular economy would educate individuals on their consumption habits in addition to enhancing recycling systems.\n\u00a0\u00a0The Circular Economy: Is it Feasible?\nMaking a production cycle fully self-sufficient is virtually impossible. There will always be some waste produced and some new input required.\nSince the term \u201ccircular economy\u201d can refer to everything from enhancing recycling programmes to leveraging technology to streamline the sharing economy, critics claim it is challenging to quantify the environmental effects of this notion.\u00a0\nAs businesses invest in more technology and train staff and customers to adopt new behaviours, creating a circular economy also comes with substantial upfront expenditures.\u00a0\nSome claim that the circular economy will just only postpone the detrimental impacts of the linear economy on the environment.\nWhat are the Benefits of the Circular Economy?\nEnvironmental protection: By reducing emissions, using fewer natural resources, and creating less garbage.\nBenefits for the local economy include promoting business models that utilize recycled garbage from the area as a source of raw materials.\nPromotes the development of a new, imaginative, and competitive industrial model, which has a positive impact on the economy and increases jobs.\nIn the next 5-7 years, the circular economy has the potential to produce 1.4 crore employment and lakhs of new businesses says NITI Aayog.\nEncourages the independent use of resources by reducing the need for imported raw materials.\nIncreased Potential for Economic Growth: According to the UNCTAD, India could adopt circular principles in just three industries\u2014cities and construction, food and agriculture, and mobility and vehicle manufacturing\u2014to generate an additional $200+ billion in economic value by 2030 and $600+ billion by 2050.\nReduced Negative Externalities: Consumers will also receive items that are more inventive and long-lasting, which will improve their quality of life and save them money over time.\nWhat actions do governments take?\n\nThey are building action plans and making international pledges to encourage manufacturers and consumers to shift toward a more circular economy.\u00a0\n\nCountries like Canada are outlawing single-use plastics like straws, cutlery, and check-out bags, encouraging retailers and eateries to invest in environmentally friendly alternatives. In March 2020, the European Commission approved a new circular economy action plan.\nA transformation to a circular economy is discussed in the Union Budget for 2022\u20132023.\nA budget of 2000 crore has been set aside to encourage the development of high-efficiency solar modules, which will help the government reach its goal of 280 GW of installed solar power.\nThe budget has encouraged the establishment of business models for energy saving, the use of biomass pellets, and thermal power plants.\nThe budget highlights the expectation that the shift to a circular economy will boost productivity and generate new jobs.\nIt holds for a variety of industries, including the production of electronics.\nCircular economy (CE) action plans are being developed for 11 categories of waste by committees constituted by NITI Aayog. These waste categories include municipal waste, scrap metal, electronic waste, lithium-ion batteries, solar panels, gypsum, toxic and hazardous industrial waste, used oil waste, agriculture waste, tyre and rubber recycling, and end-of-life vehicles.\u00a0\nCE action plans for five waste categories \u2013 lithium-ion batteries, e-waste, toxic and hazardous industrial waste, scrap metal (ferrous and non-ferrous), and tyre and rubber recycling \u2013 have been finalised and are under implementation. Further, an overarching national policy for mainstreaming resource efficiency and circular economy across all sectors is in the works.\n\nRead:\u00a0Battery waste management; Solid Waste Management; Solar Waste Management\n\nConclusion\n\nA good alternative to the linear economy is the circular economy. Resources can be used more effectively and efficiently by maximising their value throughout the life cycles of the goods that include them, and negative effects on the environment, the economy, and society related to product life cycles can be reduced.\n\nAs a result, the circular economy provides a simple solution that satisfies existing policy objectives. There is a lot of room to grow the circular economy\u2019s contribution to the global economy.\n\nMains Practice Question:\n\nCircular Economy is the key to Green India.

    "[CONTENT] #936": "Unemployment means when someone actively searches for work but is unsuccessful. There are different types of unemployment that are explained in this article.\n\nUnemployment is a major economic criterion for defining a nation\u2019s economic health because it shows the capability (or incapability) of healthy, educated, and willing individuals to gain a livelihood.\n\nThis does not include people who are unable to work due to retirement, a disability, higher education pursuits, etc.\n\nIn short, a higher unemployment rate indicates lesser economic growth and productivity.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypes of Unemployment\nOpen Unemployment\nDisguised Unemployment\nSeasonal Unemployment\nVulnerable Unemployment\nStructural Unemployment\nCyclical Unemployment\nTechnological Unemployment\nFrictional Unemployment\nEducated Unemployment\nUnderemployment\nChronic Unemployment\nCasual Unemployment\nReasons for Unemployment\nMeasures to Curb Unemployment\nTypes of Unemployment\n\nUnemployment can be caused by a number of reasons. A few important of them are-\n\nOpen Unemployment\n\nOpen unemployment occurs when a significant portion of the labour force is unable to find a position that may provide them with a stable source of income.\n\nReason: The labour force is growing Bigger than the pace of economic expansion. Therefore, not everyone finds employment.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDisguised Unemployment\n\nIn this case, more individuals are working than is truly necessary. Production is not harmed even if some are pulled. In other words, it refers to a situation in which there is an excess of labour and certain workers have zero marginal output.\n\nReason: The main causes of disguised unemployment in India may be related to overcrowding in agriculture brought on by the country\u2019s fast population increase and a lack of alternative employment opportunities.\n\nIn India, it is mainly found in the agricultural and unorganised sectors.\n\nSeasonal Unemployment\n\nThis type of unemployment happens at different times of the year. Production activities only happen during certain seasons in several sectors and professions, such as agriculture, holiday destinations, ice manufacturers, etc.\n\nAs a result, they only offer jobs for a limited time each year. People who participate in such activities run the risk of not finding work during the off-season.\n\nUnemployment is a major economic criterion for defining a nation\u2019s economic health because it shows the capability (or incapability) of healthy, educated, and willing individuals to gain a livelihood.\n\nVulnerable Unemployment\n\nPeople who work informally, without adequate job contracts or other legal protection, are said to be in vulnerable employment. Since no records of their employment are ever kept, these people are considered to be \u201cunemployed.\n\nIt is one of the primary categories of unemployment in India.\n\nStructural Unemployment\n\nThis kind of unemployment develops as a result of substantial adjustments made to a nation\u2019s economic structure. These adjustments may have an impact on a production factor\u2019s demand or supply.\n\nStructural employment is a natural byproduct of the tremendous global economic growth, technical innovation, and advancement that is occurring in every area.\n\nFor example: Unable to get a job due to a lack of required skills or poor education level or lack of advancement.\n\nCyclical Unemployment\n\nIt is brought on by trade cycles, which happen periodically. Typically, trade cycles are a feature of capitalist economies. Unemployment is caused by a decline in business activity. Typically, cyclical unemployment is a short-run\u00a0situation.\n\nThe figure for Cyclical unemployment in India is almost negligible.\n\nTechnological Unemployment\n\nIt is the outcome of some technological advancement in production methods, which could not need a lot of labour. Because it is capital intensive, modern technology uses fewer workers and that leads to this type of unemployment.\n\nIn 2016, World Bank data said that year by year the proportion of jobs threatened by automation in India is 69%.\n\nFrictional Unemployment\n\nUnsuccessful labour market adjustments between supply and demand lead to frictional unemployment.\n\nThis sort of unemployment is brought on by the labour force\u2019s inactivity, a lack of accurate and timely information, the seasonal nature of employment, etc. It is also called search unemployment.\n\nIt is sometimes considered voluntary unemployment because it is not caused because of any shortage of jobs, opposite to that, the workers themselves either quit or choose not to get jobs at a point in search of better opportunities.\n\nFor Example: the time lag between jobs when an individual is searching for a new job.\n\nEducated Unemployment\n\nIn addition to open unemployment, many educated people are underemployed since their qualifications do not fit the position. The main causes of unemployment among educated young people in India are the country\u2019s flawed educational system, mass production, desire for white-collar work, a lack of employable skills, and a decline in regular salaried employment.\n\nOpen unemployment or underemployment may both apply to educated people.\n\nUnderemployment\n\nPeople who are employed are in a circumstance where they are not contributing as much as they could. In such a scenario,\u00a0people take up a position that needs less educational qualification. that means people are unable to untap their potential and settle for lesser work because of the lack of employment opportunities.\n\nChronic Unemployment\n\nChronic unemployment is defined as persistent unemployment over an extended period of time. The primary reasons for long-term unemployment are population expansion that is out of control and an inadequate degree of economic development as a result of poverty\u2019s vicious circle.\n\nCasual Unemployment\n\nCasual unemployment can happen when a person is not regularly or day to day basis employed because of short-term contracts, a lack of raw materials, a decline in demand, a change in ownership, etc.\n\nReasons for Unemployment\nLack of entrepreneurship culture- This has limited the scope.\nInadequate resources or opportunities- This covers illiteracy, linguistic ability, transportation, and many other things.\nLack of skilled employment- The rates of employment availability are changing along with the times. Businesses are now searching for more specialised talents as a result of the deployment of AI.\nlack of relevant jobs- This undermines the qualification and abilities.\nInadequate employability- There must be more employers and enterprises to accommodate the increased demand for jobs.\nMeasures to Curb Unemployment\n\nIt is important\u00a0to address frictional and cyclical unemployment by creating more jobs. There are steps that can be implemented to encourage companies to hire more workers at a better wage to foster growth.\n\nIt is important\u00a0to address frictional and cyclical unemployment by creating more jobs.

The remaining airports are governed by the Aircraft Act (1934).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSignificance of Aviation Infrastructure\nChallenges of Aviation Infrastructure\nGovernment Initiatives\nWay Forward\nConclusion\nSignificance of Aviation Infrastructure\nIn India, there are large plains that make for good landing sites. It provides an excellent transition from railways\nCompared to other forms of transportation, it is the fastest way to move both people and cargo.\nTransporting expensive, light, and perishable items that cannot be moved by road or rail is made simple by the availability of air transportation.\nPhysical impediments, such as rivers, mountains, and valleys, are absent in air transport, thus allowing for smooth movement around the world.\nIt improves connectivity to smaller cities and the northeastern states. Thus increasing regional connectivity.\nAir travel is widely used during earthquakes, floods, accidents, and starvation while trains and roads are not very useful for rescue operations.\nIt has significant strategic implications. It can be used to advance both internal and external security.\nChallenges of Aviation Infrastructure\nThere is a problem of unavailability of space and land to expand the airports.\nThe government approval processes frequently cause delays in the development of airport infrastructure.\nLack of funds is a challenge the government is currently dealing with. Therefore, the development of the infrastructure is moving in the direction of PPP models.\nWhen airline ticket prices will increase, customers often might turn to trains and other modes of transportation.\nAccording to an audit undertaken by the International Civil Aviation Organization, India\u2019s air safety oversight is weaker than that of Bangladesh, the Maldives, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and North Korea.\nIneffective administration of air navigation, air traffic, airline slots waiting, etc. is some of the other issues.\nThere is a shortage of pilots as well as there are gaps in the skills of pilots, crew members, and ground handling personnel.\nIn India, the cost of fuel accounts for 45% of operating expenses, compared to a global average of 30%.\nDue to heavy central and state taxation, India\u2019s aviation fuel prices are higher than those of ASEAN and the Middle East nations.\nDue to heavy central and state taxation, India\u2019s aviation fuel prices are higher than those of ASEAN and the Middle East nations.\nThe UDAN Scheme is not operating well because many planned routes have not yet become operational, leaving the country\u2019s hinterland partially disconnected from the aviation industry.\nIndia constructs airports only when there is a need, which slows the expansion of the aviation sector.\nDespite India\u2019s status as a \u201cUnilateral Open Sky\u201d nation, cargo mobility is still in its youth.\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nUde Desh ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) Plan: To develop regional routes that are both inexpensive and profitable, so that even in small communities, the average person can afford to fly.\n\n100% FDI is allowed in non-scheduled air transport services, flying schools, helicopter services, and seaplane services through an automated route.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDigiSky: Online site that complies with the civil aviation rules for using drones for commercial purposes.\n\nThe 2016 National Civil Aviation Policy: The policy is covering 22 areas of the aviation sector. Airlines must deploy 20 aircraft or 20% of their total capacity for domestic operations, whichever is higher. This will expand the reach of Indian airline services abroad.\n\ne-Sahaj: The Civil Aviation Ministry\u2019s online platform e-Sahaj offers 100% of security clearances.\n\nDigi Yatra Platform: Biometric digital processing technology to save travelers from multiple airport security procedures.\n\nAlso read: International Climate Action in Civil Aviation\n\nWay Forward\n\nComplete the worldwide UDAN program. It will increase the current capacity of international airports while also completing the ongoing initiatives under the UDAN initiative in a timely manner.\n\nAircraft powered by solar energy and biofuels are the need of the hour.\n\nCities with multiple airports will help to reduce traffic.\n\nDeveloping a manufacturing ecosystem in the nation through long-term initiatives to support advanced research in aviation technologies.\n\nThere is a need for cutting-edge technology for the effective operation of the air traffic control and navigation system.\n\nThe aviation industry has to think about the \u201cStart-up India\u201d project. Young entrepreneurs are the backbone of high-tech firms and are revolutionizing many traditional industries.\n\nTo stay up with modern aircraft technology, industry expansion, and passenger demand, it is important to amend India\u2019s 1934 Aircraft Act and 1937 Aircraft Rules.\n\nVacant land around the Airports Authority of India (AAI) airports in all major cities should be monetized to boost non-aeronautical earnings and management techniques. It will lead to the effective utilization of AAI resources.\n\nTo address the skilled labor shortage, businesses and educational institutions should work together to integrate the latest technology.\n\nAirlines that perform poorly may switch to cargo transport.\n\nMake India a transshipment hub by creating digital business enablers like e-contracting, e-multimodal transportation, e-compliances, and an e-grievance redressal module.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is a significant untapped market for aviation in India. The government must continue to promote this industry with effective policy measures. This would boost the home economy and India\u2019s aviation sector\u2019s global presence in terms of both passenger and freight traffic.\n\nThe major part of countries GDP is mostly derived from the travel and aviation industries, hence it is essential to assure economic growth and development. For this sector to flourish at a good rate, the Central Government and the State Governments should work together.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Aviation safety\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav.",

    "[CONTENT] #954": "Inflation-indexed bonds are often seen in the news. Do you know what exactly it is? Read to know more about Inflation-indexed bonds.\n\nDid you ever think about saving a part of your income? Probably the first thing which came to our mind will be of savings account or buying a bond. However year by year there is an overall rise in prices which reduces our purchasing power over time. This is due to inflation. Here comes the role of inflation-indexed bonds.\n\nWhen the principal amount of a bond is indexed to inflation, it is called an inflation-indexed bond. Indexed to inflation means the principal amount rises or falls with the rate of inflation. Regardless of the amount of inflation in the economy, the investor is guaranteed a continuous return.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow is interest on an Inflation-indexed bond calculated?\nFeatures of inflation-indexed bonds:\nCurrently, IIBs are linked to WPI, not to CPI.

If inflation rises by 10%, in the case of a fixed deposit investor will receive Rs.5 per year as interest while in an inflation-indexed bond, the principal amount will get adjusted to Rs.110. Hence the resulting interest payment will be Rs.110 \u00d7 5% i.e. Rs. 5.5. At the time of redemption, adjusted principal or face, whichever is higher will be paid.\n\nFeatures of inflation-indexed bonds:\nCoupons will be paid on half yearly basis. The fixed coupon rate will be paid on an adjusted principal.\nIIBs are issued for 10 years.\nAs they are G-secs, eligible for SLR status.\nThe main objective is to protect middle the poor and middle classes\u2019 savings against inflation.\nThe minimum amount of investment is Rs. 5000 and the maximum limit is Rs. 10 lakh per annum for individual investors and Rs. 25 lakh per annum for institutions.\n\nInflation-indexed bond was first issued by Massachusetts Bay Company during the American Revolution to combat inflation\u2019s effects on the price of consumer goods in the colonies during the war.\n\nIn India, IIBs were announced in the 2013 budget mainly to provide an alternative for the household to invest in rather than gold as the increasing current account deficit (CAD) driven by higher gold imports is of serious concern. Until 2013, capital-indexed bonds were issued which will protect only the principal, unlike IIBs which can provide inflation protection for interest payments as well.\n\nCurrently, IIBs are linked to WPI, not to CPI. Why?\n\nBecause in India CPI is being released since January 2011 and will take some time to stabilize. Also, monetary policy is being continued to target WPI for its price stability objective.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nGlobally CPI is used for inflation targets by central banks as CPI reflects the inflation faced by the majority.\n\nTax treatments:\nTax provisions are applicable on interest payments and capital gains made when sold in the secondary market (through the BSE, NSE, and other stock exchanges).\nThere will be no special tax treatment for these bonds.\n\nUnited States, India, Canada, and many other countries now issue Inflation-indexed bonds.

    "[CONTENT] #957": "What are the Planning and Economic Reforms? Why is it so important that it is considered by almost all leaders? What are the Gandhian and Nehruvian approaches to planning? To answer these questions, read further.\n\nOne of the most notable inventions of the 20th century was socioeconomic planning. The nation understood the value of planned growth even before it attained independence.\n\nNearly all of the national leaders saw political freedom as the major solution to these core issues.\n\nThe Constitution became effective on January 26, 1950. The planning era in India began on April 1, 1951, with the introduction of the First Five-Year Plan, and planning officially began on March 15, 1950, with the creation of the Planning Commission.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of Planning\nGandhian approach\nThe Nehruvian model\nFeatures of the Nehruvian model\nHistory of Planning\nThe idea of a planned economy first and foremost came into existence in the 1930s, when our country\u2019s leaders were influenced by socialist philosophy.\nIndia\u2019s five-year plans were significantly impacted by the USSR\u2019s enormous development accomplished through five-year plans.\nSir M. Visvesvaraya in his 1934 book \u201cPlanned Economy in India,\u201d proposed a promising plan for India\u2019s advancement over the succeeding ten years.\nHis main objective was to come up with a plan for moving labor from agriculture to industry and tripling the country\u2019s GDP in ten years. This was the first significant academic study on the topic of planning.\nThe economic perspective of India\u2019s freedom movement changed between the Indian National Congress sessions in Karachi in 1931 and Faizpur in 1936.\nThe first attempt to create a national plan for India was launched in 1938. That year, Jawaharlal Nehru served as the chairman of the National Planning Committee, founded by Subhash Chandra Bose, the president of Congress.\nHowever, the committee\u2019s recommendations could not be written, and only a small number of papers were first published in 1948\u20131949.\nEight businessmen from Bombay worked on \u201cA Brief Memorandum Outlining a Plan of Economic Development for India\u201d in 1944. They included Mr. JRD Tata, GD Birla, Purshottamdas Thakurdas, Lala Shriram, Kasturbhai Lalbhai, AD Shroff, Ardeshir Dalal, and John Mathai.\nEven though Nehru did not formally embrace the plan, many of its elements were integrated into later designs. This is known as the \u201cBombay Plan.\u201d\nLater the People\u2019s Plan was prepared by MN Roy. This ten-year strategy placed the highest priority on agriculture. It involves the nationalization of all production. The main component of this plan was agriculture.\nThis proposal was developed by M N Roy on behalf of the Indian Federation of Lahore and is based on Marxist socialism.\nThen the Gandhian Plan was developed by Wardha Commercial College\u2019s principal, Sriman Nayaran. It gave economic decentralization priority while concentrating on rural development by fostering cottage industries.\nThe Sarvodaya Plan was created in 1950 by Jaiprakash Narayan. The Sarvodaya Idea and Gandhian Plan of Vinoba Bhave both had an impact on this strategy. This plan focused on small and cottage businesses as well as agriculture.\nIt also strongly emphasized freedom from foreign technologies, decentralized participatory planning, and land reforms.\nTo evaluate plans and potential projects and offer suggestions, the Interim Government set up a planning advisory board in October 1946.\nGandhian approach\n\nGandhi was not an economist in a conventional sense. Nor he has given any systematic views on the model of development to be adopted by India.\n\nWe get the blueprint of Gandhian idea of development in his book Hind Swaraj.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHe was a critic of the Western model of development and believed that if the other adopts the same model, nine more earth are needed.\n\nThe fundamental idea governing the Gandhian approach to development was the principle of Nonviolence and Swaraj. Non-violence even towards nature and minimization of needs.\n\nThe three pillars of the Gandhian approach were economic growth, redistributive justice, and morale regeneration.\n\nGandhian approach to the way of life can be understood based on his concept of the seven sins.\n\nThe seven sins of Gandhi are wealth without work, Pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, commerce without morality, science without humanity, worship without sacrifice, and politics without ethics.\n\nAt the time of independence, he proposed a Development plan.\n\nIt included the Reform of agriculture and believed that it will address hunger and unemployment. This suggested that the government should focus on land reforms, cooperatives, and rural credit.\n\nThey also suggested the revival of the cottage industries as it will not only provide a supplementary income but the Khadi was the way to address the requirement for clothing also.\n\nThus, the focus of the Gandhian plan was to fulfill the basic necessity as a priority.\n\nThere is a misunderstanding that Gandhi was against machines and industrialization. Gandhi was not against machines, he was only against imitating the Western model in the Indian situation.\n\nHis concerns were that machines should not be pitted against human beings, and mechanization results in the accumulation of wealth and increasing exploitation.\n\nThus the Gandhian approach was to make Indian villages self-sufficient entities. He was in favor of the revival of the village Republic as he believed that India lives in its villages. Without the resurrection of villages, the goal of Swaraj remains incomplete.\n\nThe Gandhian approach was not adopted. And we can see the consequences of the neglect of the Gandhian approach.\n\nThe Nehruvian model\n\nNehru was not an economist. He was a modernist. He was impressed by the achievements of the USSR.\n\nNehru wanted to make India a modern and scientific society. He described his philosophy as progressive socialism. Nehru always wanted India to be a society based on a socialistic pattern.\n\nHis realistic approach to the development strategy can be understood from the second five-year plan which was based on the Nehru Mahalanobis model.\n\nFeatures of the Nehruvian model\n\nNehru favored investment in heavy industries as it will promote capital formation. The investment in heavy industries will help in making India independent of the imports of essential goods.\n\nNehru introduced centralized planning, even though centralized planning goes against the spirit of federalism.\n\nThe Nehruvian model neglected the consumer industry. As he believed that Indian need to make sacrifices in the short term for a better life in the longer term.\n\nNehru was not against the agrarian reforms but he believe that industrialization will create more demand for agricultural goods and automation will provide fertilizer, equipment for the promotion of agriculture, etc\n\nNehru knew that his model would create shortages of basic commodities and hence he introduced physical control on rationing and fiscal control on administered pricing.\n\nTo avoid income disparities, the Nehruvian model put State in the commanding heights of the economy and kept the Private sector weak to check the accumulation of wealth.\n\nThe public sector will not only address the concentration of wealth but also provide employment.\n\nNehruvian policies could not address the structural weaknesses of the Indian economy. Rationing has resulted in black marketing. The public sector was not working on economic logic, it was producing poor-quality goods at a higher price.\n\nThe Nehruvian model was import substitution and export promotion. However, India could not produce manufactured goods that can be exported.\n\nThe Nehruvian model resulted in India becoming the license permit quota Raj, which ultimately made India an Inspector Raj or overdeveloped state.\n\nEconomics is always dynamic. And so the Economic Policies. The policies need to be changed as per the changing scenario. During Nehru times our economy was an infant. However, today is the era of the survival of the fittest. We always need to change as per the requirements.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav.",

What are the objectives and key features of this scheme? Read here to know more.\n\nThe Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act was passed on 23rd August 2005 and it was officially launched on 2nd February 2006.\n\nDo you know what was MGNREGA earlier called? It was known to be National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. Learn more about this topic.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is MGNREGA?\nThe objectives of the Act are:\nKey features of MGNREGA:\nSignificance of MGNREGA:\nChallenges of MGNREGA:\nWay forward\nWhat is MGNREGA?\nMGNREGA is a rural wage employment program in India.\nIt provides for a legal guarantee of at least 100 days of unskilled wage employment in a financial year to rural households whose adult members are willing to engage in unskilled manual work at a predetermined minimum wage rate.\nThe Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), Govt of India is monitoring the entire implementation of this scheme in association with state governments.\nThe objectives of the Act are:\nTo enhance the livelihood security of the rural poor by generating wage employment opportunities; and\nTo create a rural asset base which would enhance productive ways of employment, and augment and sustain a rural household income.\nAdults in rural households provide the Gram Panchayat with their name, age, address, and photo. Following inquiries, the Gram Panchayat registers homes and gives an employment card. The information about an enrolled adult member, including his or her picture, is on the job card. The registered person may write to the Panchayat or the Programme Officer to request employment (for at least fourteen days of continuous work).\nThe Panchayat/Program officer will accept a legitimate application and issue a dated receipt of it. A letter outlining the applicant\u2019s duties will be delivered to them as well as displayed in the Panchayat office. Within a 5 km radius of the job site, employment will be offered; if farther than that, extra pay will be given.\nOn February 2, 2006, MGNREGA was first put into effect as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) in 200 chosen backward districts of India. As of April 1, 2007, it was extended to an additional 130 districts. Later, beginning on April 1, 2008, coverage began for the remaining 285 districts. NREGA was renamed MGNREGA by the National Rural Employment Guarantee (Amendment) Act of 2009.\nThe work is usually on projects to build durable assets like roads, canals, ponds and wells.\nKey features of MGNREGA:\nLegal right to work: The Act gives adult members of rural households a legal right to employment, in contrast to past job guarantee programmes. The beneficiaries must include at least one-third of women.\nWages: Unless the central government notifies of a pay rate, wages shall be paid by the wages stipulated for agricultural labourers in the state under the Minimum Wages Act of 1948. (this should not be less than Rs 60 per day). Currently, the federal government sets pay rates, which vary by state.\nWage-material ratio: The Act stipulates a minimum wage-material ratio of 60:40. The average wage per day per person in 2016-17 was Rs 161.\nDecentralised planning: Gram Sabhas must recommend the projects to be carried out and must carry out at least 50% of them. Pris is largely in charge of organising, carrying out, and overseeing the projects that are done.\nTransparency and accountability: Wall writings, citizen information boards, management information systems, and social audits are all options for proactive disclosure. Gram Sabhas carry out social audits so that the locals may keep track of how the programme is being implemented.\nFunding: The federal government and the states split the cost of funding. Wages (for unskilled, semiskilled, and skilled labour), material costs, and administrative costs make up the three main categories of expenditures. 100% of the cost of unskilled labour, 75% of the cost of semi-skilled and skilled labour, 75% of the cost of supplies, and 6% of the cost of administrative expenses are covered by the central government.\nTime-bound guarantee of work and unemployment allowance: Employment must be provided within 15 days of being demanded failing which an \u2018unemployment allowance\u2019 must be given.\nWorksite facilities: All work sites should have facilities such as cr\u00e8ches, drinking water and first aid.\n\nAlso read: Postal History of India\n\nSignificance of MGNREGA:\n\nSocial\n\nMGNREGA is the largest social security scheme in the world.\n\nEmpowerment of vulnerable sections: Large-scale engagement of women, people from traditionally marginalised groups like Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SCs/STs), and others. Women generate 47% of the total person-days, while SCs/STs contribute 51% of the total person-days.\nPoverty alleviation: The less poor have used it as a means to augment their income by working during slow agricultural seasons, while the poor have used it as a means of escaping poverty.\nDistress migration: MGNREGA has a highly positive impact on poor households with a drastic reduction in the distress migration\nSome studies even point to improved education for children in MGNREGA households.\n\nEconomical\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEmployment generation: Since this program\u2019s introduction in 2006, it has altered the rural labour market\u2019s makeup. Rural households were given the chance to make a minimal income by receiving employment cards under this programme.\nIncreasing wage rate: Increasing the wage rate in rural areas and thereby increasing the purchasing power in rural India\nThrust to the rural economy: Strengthening the rural economy through the creation of infrastructure assets.\nFinancial inclusion: Payments under the scheme today are mostly by way of direct transfer into beneficiary accounts \u2014 which in turn forced people to open 10 crore new bank or post office accounts. The scheme has indirectly enabled households to get freed from the clutches of local money lenders too.\n\nPolitical\n\nDecentralisation: Strengthening PRIs by involving them in the planning and monitoring of the scheme.\nChallenges of MGNREGA:\n\nEconomical\n\nRidiculously low wage rate: MGNREGA wage rates are now lower than the matching state/UT minimum wages in 34 of 35 states and union territories. The MGNREGA wage rate cannot be less than the state\u2019s minimum agricultural wage rate, according to several rulings. Because workers aren\u2019t interested in working for MGNREGA programmes due to the absurdly low pay rates, contractors and intermediaries are now in control locally.\nInadequate budgetary allocation: Researchers determined that the scheme should have received an allocation of Rs 76,131 crore, which was less than the actual amount, to satisfy the registered work requirement in 2017\u201318. Similar to practically every year, the first six months see more than 80% of the funds depleted.\nInflation: As agricultural labourers\u2019 pay has multiplied, forcing farmers to seek higher prices for their food grains through Minimum Support Prices, the MGNREGA initiative to reduce poverty has come at the expense of skyrocketing food prices (MSPs).\nAffected labour market: Rural agricultural labourer wages are pushing farmers to mechanise their operations, which is proving to be more cost-effective.\nImpact on urban sectors: MGNREGA also has implications for the increase of urban wages in sectors like infrastructure and real estate, which depend on migrant workers from rural areas. This increases the costs of real estate and infrastructure projects.\nThe banking puzzle: The rural banks are highly de-capacitated in terms of staff and infrastructure and thus always remain hugely crowded.\n\nAdministrative challenges\n\nFabrication of job cards: The availability of fraudulent job cards, the use of fictitious identities, missing data, and delays in entering information into employment cards are only a few of the problems.\nDemand-supply mismatch in work allocation: Researchers have discovered a growing disparity between the supply and demand for labour. According to a 2017\u201318 research of 3,500 panchayats, the employment that was offered was 32% less than the need for labour that was created.\nDelay in payment of wages: The majority of states have not fulfilled the MGNREGA requirement to pay wages within 15 days. Additionally, workers are not reimbursed for late wage payments. Wage payments are frequently delayed for weeks or even months without providing any sort of compensation.\nNon-payment of unemployment allowances: When the job is not readily available, the majority of states do not provide unemployment benefits. The failure to provide dated receipts for the requested work hinders employees from requesting unemployment benefits.\nIneffectiveness of local bodies: Since Panchayat Samitis hasn\u2019t been met in months, work approval has been put off. In 2015\u201316, only 10% of the 4.8 crore households were able to fully benefit from 100 days of labour.\nWorkers penalised for administrative lapses: The ministry withholds wages from employees of states that fail to comply with administrative obligations within the allotted time frame (such as submitting the audited fund statements from the previous financial year, utilisation certificates, bank reconciliation certificates, etc.).\n\nPolitical\n\nAsymmetry: The ability of the states to predict labour demand and then submit a plan articulating the same is what determines the flow of resources to certain states. The programme may be regressive because of the reduced resource flow in the poorer states due to their inability to plan. Thus, there is a chance that programmes like MGNREGA, which depend on the ability of the states to implement them, will lead to a budgetary imbalance.\nCorruption: Muster rolls are inflated and middlemen pocket the difference. As a result, a large amount of money is siphoned-off by them.\n\nSocial\n\nBehavioural implications: People who are employed under MGNREGA are developing the habit of getting paid for doing nothing, which could have major repercussions for India\u2019s human prowess and outlook. This is because most of the labour done under MGNREGA is not well planned and is frequently perfunctory.\nImpact on skilled occupations: Many specialised professions, such as handloom weavers and rural craftsmen, are losing their workforce to MGNREGA, which causes a loss of expertise in that particular field. Thus, even though employment guarantee programmes like MGNREGA offer higher incomes and have little to no effect on skill development, they are losing the distinctive abilities that have been accumulated through generations.\nWay forward\nWage: Each state\u2019s minimum wage should be adhered to, and the CPI-Rural index should be used to index pay rather than the previous Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Laborers (CPI-AL). Similarly, wages must be updated yearly.\nTraining of functionaries: Training and capacity building of elected representatives and other functionaries of PRIs must be done regularly as it will facilitate their involvement in the implementation of MGNREGA.\nContext-specific projects: States have different needs for development because they are at different stages of socioeconomic development. Therefore, it should be permitted for state governments to carry out projects that are appropriate for their location. Under MGNREGA, a greater emphasis should be placed on skilled and semi-skilled jobs.\nSocial audits: Social audits must mandatorily be held every six months. The performance of MGNREGA is better in states with effective social audit mechanisms.\nRegular monitoring: The Ministry of Rural Development sends out National Level Monitors (NLMs) to conduct routine and targeted MGNREGA monitoring and to investigate accusations of improper use of money, among other things. By their recommendations, states should implement appropriate procedures and enhance the frequency of NLM monitoring.\nRegulation of job cards: It should be made illegal to possess job cards with elected PRI representatives and MGNREGA officials, as well as to not register employment-related information in job cards.\nConvergence: A greater emphasis on convergence with other schemes such as the PMKSY, National Rural Livelihoods Mission, National Rural Health Mission, etc.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

It is still employed today to create durable threads and other jute-based goods.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy are Jute industries important for India?\nOther benefits\nWhat leads to Golden Fibre Revolution?\nConclusion\nWhy are Jute industries important for India?\n\nIndia and Bangladesh are the two countries that produce the most jute worldwide. The only limit to this carbon-neutral crop\u2019s potential is your imagination, but its potential is still unrealized.\n\nThis miracle crop is not just much more profitable than the majority of cash and food crops, but it also scores big points for sustainability.\n\nJute is the second most common natural fibre after cotton in the world, but cotton requires five times as much water, five times as many areas, and a staggering amount of chemicals to grow.\n\nJute can be used for countless industrial and domestic applications due to its high tensile strength, \u00a0breathability, low extensibility, ease of blending with both synthetic and natural fibres, acoustic and thermal insulation,\u00a0and antistatic properties. Examples include insulation (replacing glass wool), geotextiles, carpet backings,\u00a0activated carbon powder, gunny bags,\u00a0wall coverings, flooring, garments, rugs, ropes, \u00a0handicrafts, curtains, \u00a0paper, furniture and\u00a0sandals.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nKnow more about Jute industries in India.\n\nOther benefits\n\nJute improves the fertility and condition of the soil, which is advantageous to all plants growing there. Carbon credits are awarded to jute farmers who manage their crops, and they can use these credits to reduce their costs. The quantity of the carbon credit for jute farming is determined by farmers\u2019 savings on purchases of inorganic fertiliser. Since jute is a renewable resource, it is a vital resource for the paper sector.\n\nWhat leads to Golden Fibre Revolution?\n\nJute is the most widely produced sustainable and adaptable fibre in India, yet we uses relatively little creativity to market it. India was the only country that contributed significantly to the production of jute before we gained our independence.\n\nFollowing independence, the sector experienced hardship for a number of reasons, including after India was divided, a number of jute-producing districts in India were integrated into Bangladesh. As a result, India was running low on raw supplies. Because all of the machinery used to process jute had become outdated, new machines were urgently needed.\n\nDue to a lack of diversification and an excessive reliance on jute bags, the jute sector in India has become stagnant, ineffective, and unproductive. The industries compete fiercely on the international market against nations like Bangladesh, South Korea, the Philippines, Japan, etc. As a result of illnesses in the jute mills, outdated technology, higher pricing, etc., the industry also loses competitiveness.\n\nDue to India\u2019s excessive jute dependence and failure to adapt the way jute is farmed, the country\u2019s jute industry has experienced a fall in output and popularity. The Golden Fibre Revolution got started as a result of all these elements acting simultaneously.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough numerous committees have long advocated for a \u201cGolden Fibre Revolution,\u201d the sector urgently needs fundamental changes. The sector is plagued by two main issues: out-of-date processing technology and a lack of product diversity beyond handcraft and packaging.\n\nJute should be pushed out of the emporium and into every home through a larger range of products, reclaiming the position that polluting synthetic fibres have robbed it of. Jute may in fact be India\u2019s future fabric and the answer to two significant issues: farmer hardship and pollution.\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR",

That must be without passing through Lending Service Providers (LSPs) or other third parties.\n\nClassification of Digital Lenders\n\nAs per the regulators, the \u2018Digital Lenders\u2019 are classified into three groups:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEntities regulated by the RBI and permitted to carry out lending business; for example, Banks and NBFCs.\nEntities that are authorized to carry out a lending as per other statutory or regulatory provisions but are not regulated by RBI. For example, Rural cooperatives like \u2018Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), are regulated by State Governments.\nEntities lending outside the purview of any statutory or regulatory provisions. For example, informal lenders.\nScope of Application of Digital Lending Norms\n\nThese guidelines are applicable to digital lending extended by:\n\nAll Commercial Banks,\nPrimary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, State Co-operative Banks, District Central Co-operative Banks; and\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (including Housing Finance Companies)\nConcerns related to Digital Lending\n\nRBI released Guidelines related to digital lending. The primary matter of concern that needed to be curbed or solved is related to the engagement of third parties, breach of data privacy, mis-selling of info, unfair means of business conduct, exorbitant interest rates charged on the loans and over all of it, unethical recovery practices followed.\n\nWhy Such Norms are Needed\n\nAnalyzing a participant\u2019s operational legitimacy was challenging in the absence of standardized disclosure and regulatory standards. There were over 1,100 lending apps available for Indian Android users between January and the end of February of last year, of which approximately 600 were illegal.\n\nNBFCs have a significant impact on the market. Small borrowers without a history of credit documentation, who are typically underserved by traditional financial institutions, are among its consumers in particular.\n\nTransparency is the main tenet. Lending must be done by organizations that are either under RBI regulation or have been granted a license to operate by relevant law. This would also aid in addressing regulatory arbitrage given the industry\u2019s extensive outsourcing.\n\nRBI Guidelines on Digital Lending\n\nAll loan payments and disbursements must be made directly between the borrower\u2019s and the RE\u2019s bank accounts (banks, NBFCs) and not through a pass-through or pool account of the LSPs (lending service providers) or any other entity.\n\nThe RE, not the borrower, shall pay all fees, charges, etc., payable to LSPs in the credit intermediation process.\n\nThe borrower must get a standardized Key Fact Statement (KFS) before executing the loan contract.\n\nBorrowers must be informed of the total cost of digital loans in the form of the annual percentage rate (APR). APR shall also form part of KFS.\n\nIt is forbidden to automatically increase the credit limit without the borrower\u2019s explicit consent.\n\nThe loan contract must include a cooling-off or look-up period during which borrowers can cancel their digital loans by paying the principal plus the appropriate APR without incurring any penalties.\n\nTo handle complaints relating to FinTech and digital lending, REs must make sure that they and the LSPs,\u00a0both\u00a0have\u00a0access to an appropriate nodal grievance redressal officer.\n\nData acquired by DLAs should only be done with the explicit prior consent of the borrower, be need-based, and have clear audit trails.\n\nAny lending sourced through Digital Lending Apps (DLAs) is required to be reported to Credit Information Companies (CICs) by REs irrespective of its nature or tenor.\n\nAll new digital lending products that REs extend over merchant platforms (for instance, when you purchase something via an EMI facility) and that involve short-term credit or deferred payments must be reported by REs to CICs. [ Credit Bureaus are another name for Credit Information Companies].\n\nDefinitions of Important Terms Used in the Guidelines\n\nAnnual Percentage Rate (APR): APR refers to the effective annualized rate that is charged to a borrower of a digital loan.\u00a0\u00a0APR shall be based on an all-inclusive cost and margin, including Cost of Funds, Credit Cost, Operating Cost, Processing Fee, Verification Charges, Maintenance Charges, etc., and excluding Contingent Charges such as Penal Charges, Late Payment Charges, etc.,\n\nCooling off/look-up period: If a borrower decides not to continue with the loan, they will be given a window of time, as set by the Board of the RE, during which they can quit their digital debts.\n\nDigital Lending Apps/Platforms (DLAs): User-friendly mobile and online applications that support digital lending services. Applications run by Regulated Entities (REs) as well as Lending Service Providers (LSPs) hired by REs for providing any credit facilitation services in accordance with current outsourcing standards outlined by the Reserve Bank will be included in DLAs.\n\nLending Service Provider (LSP): An agent of a Regulated Entity who, in accordance with the Reserve Bank\u2019s current outsourcing guidelines, performs one or more of the lender\u2019s functions\u2014or portions thereof\u2014in customer acquisition, underwriting support, pricing support, servicing, monitoring, and recovery of a particular loan or loan portfolio\u2014on behalf of REs.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough the percentage of digital lending is now small, given their scalability, they have the potential to quickly become significant players. The wider financial system may be affected by these implications. Senior Director and Deputy Chief Ratings Officer at CRISIL, Krishnan Sitaraman, said, \u201cWe will have to see what kind of changes the digital lenders make to their operating models in light of the new regulations, how it impacts the fees they charge, the speed of their disbursements, or how they continue to provide a seamless experience to their customers,\u201d\n\nWith the economy recovering at a respectable pace after the pandemic and our expectations of a GDP growth of 7.3% this fiscal, we expect demand for loans across the credit ecosystem to be higher this fiscal even though higher inflation and interest rates. Digital lenders should proactively create and adhere to a code of conduct that specifies the values of honesty, openness, and consumer protection and includes specific guidelines for disclosure and complaint resolution. So, it is important to be under regulation in order to avoid a distorted financial system in the future.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Read the article to know more about it.\n\nThe energy needs of India are on rising due to the electrification of more houses and new industries coming into being.\n\nDo you think we have a sufficient amount of coal to meet this rising demand as people are moving to a new developmental phase?\n\nHow developing the coal sector help the country overcome the present power crisis?\n\nAlso read: Mining Sector in India\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\nHow can the coal crisis lead to power cuts?\nCoal imports\nWho is responsible for the exploration and development of coal reserves in India?\nReasons for coal shortage in recent times\nConclusion\nIntroduction\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nIndia has the fourth largest coal reserves in the world. It is estimated to be around 319.02 billion tonnes of which not even 1 billion tonnes is extracted in a year. The majority of extracted coal is used for electricity production. The remaining coal is used for cement, steel and other industries.\n\nThe top five states in terms of total coal reserves in India are:\n\nJharkhand\nOdisha\nChhattisgarh\nWest Bengal\nMadhya Pradesh\nHow can the coal crisis lead to power cuts?\n\nDifferent sources of power production are renewable and non-renewable sources. Non-renewable accounts for coal and non-coal sources (diesel, natural gas). Coal (Thermal base power production) is the major component of entire electricity production.\n\nOther sources such as renewables i.e. wind, solar, etc, are not reliable sources of power. They have their limitations and cannot provide power for 24 hours.\n\nSimilarly, non-coal sources of non-renewable sources also have their limitations. Its capacity is not beyond a particular point. In the total amount of electricity, the production of coal constitutes around 70%. This is the reason why the coal crisis led to power cuts.\n\nCoal imports\n\nIndia is the second-largest importer of coal after China. As per the present Import policy, coal can be freely imported (under Open General Licence) by the consumers themselves considering their needs based on their commercial prudence.\nSteel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and other steel-making facilities import coking coal primarily to fill the gap between demand and supply domestically and to raise the quality.\n\nNon-coking coal is imported by coal-based power stations, cement factories, captive power plants, sponge iron plants, industrial customers, and coal traders.\n\nRelated link: Coal mining in India\n\nWho is responsible for the exploration and development of coal reserves in India?\n\nThe Ministry of Coal is ultimately responsible for formulating policies and strategies regarding the exploration and development of coal and lignite reserves, for approving significant projects with high economic value, and for making decisions regarding all pertinent matters.\n\nThese important roles are carried out by the Public Sector Undertakings Coal India Ltd. and its subsidiaries and Neyveli Lignite Corporation India Limited under the administrative supervision of the Ministry (NLCIL).\n\nThe Ministry of Coal also has a joint venture with the Government of Telangana called Singareni Collieries Company Limited in addition to Coal India Ltd. and Neyveli Lignite Corporation India Ltd. Governments of Telangana and India both own 49% and 51% of the company, respectively.\n\nReasons for coal shortage in recent times\nThere was a surge in electricity demand due to the revival of the economy after the second wave of Covid19 got declined, along with a limited production of coal.\nAvailable coal cannot reach on time due to container shortages because of high imports and exports.\nHowever, starting in 2021, rising industrial demand, global price swings, and most recently, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, caused coal prices to soar to all-time highs. All of this has had a significant impact on India\u2019s coal imports.\nThe almost depleted thermal power plants are now under additional strain as a result of the increasing heat waves. The country\u2019s electricity demand reportedly reached a record high of 201 gigawatts (GW) on April 26, 2022, as several areas of the nation suffered from extreme heat.\nThe nation\u2019s industries, which have resumed operations following the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, can be blamed for the unexpected increase in demand. Additionally, despite having the fourth-largest reserves in the world, domestic coal producers cannot keep up with demand.\nConclusion\n\nTo liberalise the coal industry the government created (in June 2019) a High-Level Committee under the direction of the Vice-Chairman of NITI Aayog. This HLC issued several significant suggestions (October 2019) for coal block allocations, with the most significant being a paradigm change in which coal was to be viewed as an input to economic growth through the relevant sectors utilising coal rather than as a source of money.\n\nThe Indian government wants to accelerate economic growth in the nation\u2019s aspirational regions. Because these States have abundant natural resources, making use of those resources in the coal sector is essential to their growth. The Government of India\u2019s transparent actions and commercial auction of coal mines have come at the perfect time to close the gap between the country\u2019s supply and demand for coal.\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR",

All of this prompted India to borrow money in the short term more and more by the late 1980s.\nUp until the early 1980s, the government had wisely managed the fiscal (revenue and expenditure) situation, but it started to engage in fiscal profligacy (recklessly wasting money) by taking on large amounts of debt to support various development programs and maintain growth, which caused issues in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nAs a result, the macroeconomic foundations of the economy turned bad\u00a0(fiscal deficit of 8.4%, current account deficit of 3.14%, high inflation of 17%, huge foreign debt, etc. in 1990\u20131991); this puts a lot of pressure on the Balance of Payment (BoP) front.\n\nThe worrying foreign exchange position was partly caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, which increased oil prices (and the cost of imports) and decreased Indian exports to the Middle East or Gulf region. India\u2019s sovereign rating (international credit rating) was severely lowered, making it very challenging to obtain credit (loan) abroad.\n\nThe three primary areas in which economic changes were implemented during the Economic Reforms of 1991\u00a0were as follows:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWe removed the complex system of rules, permissions, and licenses.\nIn nearly every area of economic activity, we turned around the significant bias in favor of state ownership of the means of production and the expansion of public sector businesses.\nWe stopped pursuing an inward-looking trade strategy.\n\nThe main goal of the reforms was to quickly and thoroughly integrate the Indian economy with the global economy through trade, investment, and technology flows. To this end, it was necessary to create conditions that would provide Indian entrepreneurs with a business environment that was roughly comparable to that of other developing nations.\n\nAlso read: History of Banking in India\n\nMajor Reforms Carried Out in 1991\n\nEconomic Reforms in India in 1991 carried out several changes. A few important reforms are-\n\nFiscal Stabilisation\n\nThe effectiveness of economic reforms depends on the achievement of fiscal stabilization. In order for the reforms to succeed, the Central Government\u2019s fiscal deficit, which had reached 8.4% in the 1990\u20131991 fiscal year, needed to be reduced. The below actions were performed in order to decrease the budget deficit.\n\nExport subsidies were abolished in 1991\u20131992, and fertilizer subsidies were partially restructured in 1992\u20131993.\nBudget assistance to loss-making public-sector units in the form of government loans to cover their losses was gradually phased out.\nSome development expenditure, such as spending on social and economic infrastructure, was reformed.\nIndustrial Policy\n\nIndustrial policy has seen the most radical changes as a result of the reform plan. There is no longer\u00a0a need for the government to grant approval for new investments or for the significant expansion of current capacity as it was previously under\u00a0industrial licensing (License Raj).\n\nNowadays, only a small number of businesses are required to have licenses, mostly due to environmental and pollution concerns. Additionally, the MRTP Act was also eliminated.\nThe list of industries that were solely for the public sector to operate\u00a0was drastically reduced, and many crucial sectors were made available to the private sector, including power generation, hydrocarbons (oil and gas exploration, production, and refining), air transportation, telecommunications, and others.\nDe-licensing of items reserved for the MSME Sector\n\nSince 1991, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has been gradually de-licensing the products specified for the MSME sector through a proactive approach.\n\nForeign Investment\n\nPrior to 1991, India had an extremely restrictive and often regarded hostile foreign investment policy.\n\nThe new strategy supported foreign investment considerably more actively in a variety of ways. For foreign equity investments of up to 51 percent in a lengthy list of 34 industries, permission is automatically granted; for investments of more than 51 percent, government approval was required.\n\nTrade and Exchange Rate Policy\n\nWith certain required\u00a0exceptions,\u00a0all raw materials, other production inputs, and capital products can now be imported without restriction.\n\nPrior to 1991, the RBI-determined an official exchange rate on which the Indian Rupee was converted into foreign currency. The value of the rupee dropped by nearly 24 percent in July 1991. (for alignment of the exchange rate with the market rate).\u00a0 In 1993, India switched to a market-based exchange rate system (managed float/floating rate).\n\nTax Reforms\nIn June 1991, the highest marginal rate of personal income tax was 56%. This was decreased to 40%.\nFor publicly listed enterprises, corporate income tax was lowered from 51.75% to 46%.\nThe average amount of customs duty drastically decreased from 200% to only 65%.\nPublic Sector Reforms\n\nThe government started a restricted process of disinvesting its ownership and equity in public sector enterprises instead of going through full privatization, keeping 51% of the equity and management control.\n\nFinancial Sector Reforms\nNew private banks were allowed to compete in the banking sector, and numerous new banking licenses were granted.\nTrading practices in capital markets are kept under\u00a0transparent and\u00a0strict control. In order to oversee the major players in the capital markets and regulate stock exchanges, an independent statutory entity called SEBI was created in 1988.\nThe capital market was made available for portfolio investments, and Indian businesses were permitted to access global capital markets by issuing equity or shares overseas through Global Depository Receipts (GDR).\nImpact of Economic Reforms of 1991\n\nThe economic reforms made in 1991 had a large-scale impact.\n\nOn various macroeconomic parameters (short-term)\nWithin 2.5 years, inflation dropped from a peak of 17 percent in August 1991 to roughly 8.5 percent.\nForex reserves increased from $1.2 billion in June 1991 to nearly $15 billion in 1994.\nGDP growth rate\u00a0increased from 1.1% in 1991\u20131992 to 4% in 1992\u20131993\nThe fiscal deficit decreased from 8.4%% in 1990\u20131991 to 5.7% in 1992\u20131993\nBetween 1990\u20131991 and 1993\u20131994 exports nearly doubled.\nOn poverty reduction (long term)\n\nGrowth contributes to the reduction of poverty in two ways: first, through the percolation (trickle-down) impact, and second, by enabling the government to raise more funds to support increased social sector spending. So, in order to significantly reduce poverty, two strategies are required:\n\nallowing rapid economic growth, and\nconcentrating on specialized programs to assist the underprivileged and needy\n\nThe Indian economy grew at a faster rate of 6.3 percent when we started the reforms in 1991, which enabled the government to raise more resources and pull in a sizable population in the\u00a0growth process.\n\nHowever, despite all the reforms, a large portion of Indians remain impoverished. According to estimates from the Tendulkar Committee for 2011\u201312, there is still 21.9 percent (26.9 cr) of the population living below the poverty line. In addition to being impoverished, they lack the necessities that have been discussed since Independence and before.\n\nOn the disparity between rich and poor (long term)\n\nAccording to data from the National Council of Applied Economic Research, the Gini coefficient in income for rural and urban areas rose from 0.52 in 2004-05 to 0.55 in 2011-12. (the higher the Gini coefficient higher the inequality).\n\nAccording to data from the National Council of Applied Economic Research, the Gini coefficient in income for rural and urban areas rose from 0.52 in 2004-05 to 0.55 in 2011-12. (the higher the Gini coefficient higher the inequality). The conclusion is that poverty decreased faster but inequality rose throughout the post-reform period.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a result of our inability to provide enough work opportunities for young people, the post-reform period has been referred to as a period of jobless growth. The creation of numerous high-quality jobs is currently India\u2019s most urgent task since it is the only sustainable way to address chronic poverty; otherwise, the demographic dividend could turn into a nightmare of underemployment and unemployment.\n\nThe low rise in rural productivity in India is the other important issue, in contrast to China where rural entrepreneurship was the main economic driver for years.\n\nAccording to Raghuram Rajan (2014), India simply redistributed resources to rural regions through transfer programs (redistribution) like the guaranteed rural job plan and the minimum support price (MSP) for crops, without the concurrent increase in farm production that increased the demand for goods and services and increased inflation.\n\nHowever, since 2014, the government has boosted budgeted spending on rural infrastructure.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Kiran Kumar Reddy.\n\nThe first phase of DBT was launched in 43 districts, covering scholarships and social security pensions initially.\n\nWith effect from December 2014, it was expanded across the nation.\u00a0\n\nStructure of the Direct Benefit Transfer\n\nThe Direct Benefit Transfer program aims to bring transparency and terminate pilferage from the distribution of funds sponsored by the Central Government of India.\n\nBenefits or subsidies are immediately transferred to citizens living below the poverty level under DBT.\n\nThe Office of the Controller General of Accounts\u2019 Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System (CPSMS) serves as a common platform for routing DBT.\n\nCPSMS can be used to prepare the beneficiary list, digitally sign it, and process payments in the beneficiary\u2019s bank accounts via the Aadhaar Payment Bridge.\n\nNote: Aadhar is not mandatory to access benefits under DBT.\n\nTo know more about The Architecture Of Direct Cash Transfer To Public Using AADHAR, click here.\n\nObjectives of Direct Benefit Transfer\nCurbing pilferage and duplication.\nAccurate targeting of the beneficiary.\nReduced delay in payments.\nElectronic transfer of benefits, minimizing levels involved in benefit flow.\nThe mechanism of the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme\nFirst, the beneficiaries are determined, and the beneficiary database is digitalized.\nBeneficiaries are given bank accounts if they don\u2019t already have one.\nBeneficiaries will enrol in Aadhaar after the bank account has been set up.\nThe seeding of Aadhaar with bank accounts and the beneficiary database.\nPutting the payment into the beneficiary\u2019s account as soon as possible and starting the last-mile connectivity or service delivery under the protocol.\nThe Components of the Direct Benefit Transfer\u00a0\n\nBeneficiary Account Validation System, a strong payment and reconciliation platform integrated with RBI, NPCI, Public and Private Sector Banks, Cooperative Banks, and Regional Rural Banks (core banking solutions for banks, settlement systems of Reserve Bank, Aadhaar Payment Bridge of the Payment Corporation of India), etc., are the essential elements in the execution of DBT schemes.\n\nValidation of Beneficiary Account\n\nThese functions include features like application for the scheme by the beneficiary with a bank account and Aadhaar details, review by scheme owners for eligibility of the beneficiary according to scheme guidelines, beginning bank account/Aadhaar verification, payment initiation through Fund Transfer Order, etc. These features make up a workflow-based framework for centrally sponsored and state-linked schemes.\n\nMGNREGA, PM-AWAS, PM-KISAN, DBT-PAHAL, etc. are some examples of such systems.\n\nAlthough many of the initiatives use Aadhaar to process payments, payments can also be made using a bank account number if Aadhaar is not readily available.\n\nPayment and Reconciliation Platform\n\nBy sending payment instructions to PFMS, which then sends them to banks after the appropriate beneficiary confirmation, the IT systems of the plan start the process of paying legitimate beneficiaries.\n\nWith the integration of more than 500 banks for the verification of bank accounts and the Aadhar seeding of beneficiaries with the NPCI, PFMS has developed into a powerful payment and reconciliation platform.\n\nThe failure of payments and delays in the beneficiary receiving their monies were significantly reduced by the prior authentication of beneficiary accounts.\n\nCore Banking Solutions\n\nAs the final mile of distribution, banks are important to the DBT process flow.\n\nAll account-based transfers are sent through core banking channels. The processing effectiveness at this point along with the flow of reverse MIS provided the DBT program with the desired momentum.\n\nAadhaar Payment Bridge (APB)\n\nOne of the unusual payment methods mandated by NPCI, the Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB), leverages the Aadhaar number as a crucial key to digitally channel government rewards and subsidies into the Aadhaar Enabled Bank Accounts (AEBA) of the targeted beneficiaries.\n\nNPCI generates an Aadhaar mapper to enable the transfer of funds.\n\nThe most crucial element of the Aadhaar Payments Bridge (APB) is the Aadhaar mapper, which holds data about the bank accounts that have been seeded with the Aadhaar number and are used by NPCI to send payments to the destination Bank.\n\nThe types of schemes covered under the Direct Benefit Transfer\u00a0\n\nThe following are the different methods of cash transfer covered under DBT.\n\nCash transfer\n\nThe government immediately forwards cash to each beneficiary under the Direct Benefit Transfer cash transfer scheme. Following is a list of the numerous ways that money is transferred from the government to beneficiaries:\n\nThe beneficiary may receive the amount directly.\nThe fund is transferred from the State Treasury Account to the beneficiary.\nThrough an Implementing Agency that has been assigned by the government.\nThe beneficiary gets the fund from the State or Central Government.\nSome examples include the National Social Assistance Program (NSAP) and MGNREGA.\nIn-kind benefit transfers from the government to beneficiaries\nThe Government pays benefits to the recipients in kind under the Direct Benefit Transfer In-Kind Benefit Transfer Scheme either directly or through government-appointed implementing entities.\nThe cost of purchasing the items that can be used for public distribution and transporting them to the intended beneficiaries is often covered by the government. Then, these goods or services are provided to the beneficiaries at no cost or for a very cheap cost.\nOther types of transfers\n\nThe Direct Benefits Transfer program also distributes funding and subsidies to other non-governmental functionaries that help implement government objectives, in addition to cash and in-kind transfers.\n\nThis category of benefit transfer includes incentives, entitlements, etc. that are provided to community workers and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Due to the assistance they provide to other recipients and the community, they are provided such benefits.\n\nAdvantages of the Direct Benefit Transfer\u00a0\nDirect Benefit Transfer lessens the possibility of fraud while accelerating the safe delivery of information and money.\nIt eliminates the need for middlemen, such as government employees, by sending the subsidy amount directly to the beneficiary accounts.\nTransparency is increased, and incidences of theft from central government-sponsored monies being distributed are reduced.\nDirect Benefit Transfer ensures precise targeting of beneficiaries.\nBy linking the fund deposits to their Aadhaar details, beneficiaries will be permitted to join just one bank account, preventing the duplication of subsidies.\nIt enables the government to communicate with both citizens and program participants at the same time.\nDBT assists in the distribution of grants to worthy candidates who are living in poverty. It makes it easier for the government to communicate with the target recipients.\nThe plan prevents theft during the distribution of payments and lessens the exploitation of public resources.\nDBT is a potent settlement and transaction technology that collaborates with numerous organizations.\nDBT has shown to be a successful method of reaching out to people to disperse aid funding.\nChallenges faced by the Direct Benefit Transfer\u00a0\nDespite its widespread use and applicability, it can be noted that DBT has a few structural issues that need to be taken into account in due course.\nApproximately 91% of the population in the nation has currently registered for an Aadhar card. Since DBT and Aadhar are linked for programs, it is necessary to increase the Aadhar connection to 100% to ensure that no one is excluded.\nA low level of digital literacy in people living in rural areas poses one of the significant challenges in implementing this mechanism.\nAround 81% of Indians now have access to financial services, which may disqualify those from rural backgrounds. People won\u2019t be able to access financial facilities if they are inadequate. Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna of the Government of India will play a vital role here.\nReaching those without bank accounts is extremely difficult for bank correspondents. Additionally, internet connectivity issues and other technical difficulties plague bank correspondents. For the benefits to reach the beneficiaries, banking services in rural regions must be improved.\nDirect Benefit Transfer in PDS\n\nRecently, The Centre has decided to make the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for the Public Distribution System (PDS) optional for states as the pilot initiatives have failed to yield the desired results.\n\nDetails\n\nThe Centre had launched pilot projects for cash transfers in three Union Territories \u2014 Chandigarh, Puducherry, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli \u2014 to PDS beneficiaries, who had to then purchase food grains from the open market.\n\nFood and Public Distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan stated the DBT effort did not achieve the desired objectives since recipients diverted payments for reasons other than purchasing food grains.\n\nFurthermore, PDS recipients in a Maharashtra hamlet were offered the option of using DBT or purchasing foodgrains from a fair-pricing shop. It was discovered that the beneficiaries preferred to shop at the fair price shop.\n\nSimilarly last year, Jharkhand discontinued a DBT pilot in the public distribution system ten months after it was launched.\n\nPositives of DBT in PDS\nDBT can prevent fraudulent transactions while also reducing red tape and enhancing efficiency.\nFlexibility and convenience: PDS provided flexibility, convenience, and choice in terms of food quality \u2013 people could now buy better quality grains than what they received through the PDS or spend the money on other foods.\nTargeting: The goal of DBT is not to do away with subsidies, but to target them effectively so that they flow only to the intended beneficiaries.\nPrevent market distortion: The subsidy in indirect subsidy is embedded in the physical delivery of a product at a price lower than the open market price. This price disparity disrupts the market, creating chances for arbitrage, supply diversion, and profit in the black market.\nLow economic cost: To handle the rationing of subsidized commodities, sophisticated administrative machinery must be maintained at a high expense, which can be reduced by DBT.\nNegatives of DBT in PDS\nDelay in payment: Money not being deposited in accounts on time.\nNot Inflation indexed: The cash sum is not adjusted for market pricing or inflation. As a result, the monetary value is less than the market value of rice.\nMultiple accounts: Money is being placed into another account. This occurs when recipients open a new bank account, which is automatically connected to their Aadhaar number. The money is automatically deposited in the newest account to be seeded with Aadhaar via the Public Finance Management System \u2013 National Payments Corporation of India\u2019s cash remittance system. The beneficiary, on the other hand, examines the account registered with the civil supplies department.\nInaccessibility: According to a study by NITI Aayog, it was found that the beneficiaries of the cash transfer initiative had trouble accessing funds deposited in their bank accounts.\nLack of communication: DBT\u2019s standard operating procedures require recipients to be notified through SMS. People are unconcerned about money being deposited by SMS. As a result, recipients were frequently required to make several journeys to banks to check on and withdraw funds. This resulted in significant opportunity costs, particularly for the rural poor.\nExtra cost: It was also discovered that the majority of beneficiaries had to spend extra money on single-purpose visits to banks to withdraw the subsidy amount and to the market to purchase food grains.\nTime-consuming: Beneficiaries discovered that going to the bank to withdraw money takes longer than going to the ration shop to obtain their fortnightly rations.\nExploitation by banks: Banks were discovered to be adjusting the money beneficiaries received with any outstanding loans they had, rendering them unable to buy rice from ration stores.\nInadequate grievance redressal mechanisms: There were toll-free numbers, but people did not know how to report their grievances.\nWhat is the current level of Central Government subsidy and to what extent is it under DBT?\nIn the fiscal year 2021-22 Union Budget, the Centre allocated approximately Rs 3.70 lakh crore (more than 10% of the entire budget amount of Rs 35.83 lakh crore) for 38 different forms of subsidies, the most important of which being food, fertilizer, and gasoline.\nAll subsidies are included in DBT. DBT also covers several sorts of scholarships/stipends and monetary support, in addition to subsidies.\n312 schemes, including key subsidies being run by 54 Central Government Ministries and Departments, are part of DBT.\nThe deletion of 3.99 crore duplicate and fake/non-existent ration cards (between 2013 and 2020) resulted in an estimated saving of approximately Rs 1 lakh crore for the Public Distribution Scheme (PDS).\nMGNREGS saved 10% on wages by removing duplicate, fictitious/non-existent, and ineligible beneficiaries. Aside from that, 4.11 crore duplicate, fake/non-existent, dormant LPG connections have been removed.\nWay forward\nFor a DBT implementation to succeed, there must be a focus on three critical areas:\nProper identification of beneficiaries: Aadhaar can solve the identification problem.\nTimely transfer of money to beneficiaries: Some banking tasks could be replaced by mobile penetration. However, physical connectivity to financial centres will be required at the final mile.\nTheir ability to access these benefits with relative ease.\nChoice-based DBT system: People could be given the option of switching to cash transfers or remaining with subsidized food in this case. This will protect recipients, particularly the most vulnerable, against suboptimal implementation.\nMore pilot initiatives are needed, with a focus on beneficiary convenience rather than government cost savings. If beneficiaries embrace it freely, savings will occur, possibly in bigger numbers.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya",

This document set an agenda that focused on what gender discrimination is and called for action to eliminate it.\n\nOn July 9, 1993, India ratified the CEDAW convention with two\u00a0declaratory\u00a0statements.\n\nThe first Gender Budget Statement appeared in the Indian Budget of 2005\u20132006. Every year, the government releases a Gender Budget Statement with the Union Budget.\n\nSteps Taken by GoI to promote gender equality\n\nThe government is committed to promoting gender equality across all fields and spheres of government. \u00a0Gender budgeting is an approach the government has chosen to include a gender perspective in all phases of policy formulation.\n\nThe government has stressed that gender-sensitive legislation, policies, plans, programs, schemes, resource allocation, implementation, monitoring, auditing, and effect evaluation of programs and schemes are all part of gender budgeting.\n\nIn this regard, the Ministry of Women and Child Development has focused on:\n\nEstablishing institutional mechanisms and structures for gender budgeting across all Ministries/Departments at the central, state/UTs, and local levels.\nCreating expertise and enhancing capacity at all levels of governance for gender budgeting.\n\nThe Ministry of Women and Child Development is putting into practice a program on gender budgeting to provide financial grant-in-aid to government agencies, national and state training institutions, and organizations to conduct training and workshops to increase the capacity of various stakeholders.\n\nWomen\u2019s programs received Rs. 1.71 lakh crore (almost 5% of the total budget) in the 2022\u20132023 budget. At least 16 states have implemented gender-responsive budgets and programs that help women.\n\nSad Fact: World Economic Forum (WEF) released the Global Gender Gap (GGG) Report for 2022. India ranked 135 out of 146 countries.\n\nParts of Gender Budget\nPart A includes schemes with 100% allocation for women (for ex: Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Ujjawala, Mahila Shakti Kendra, Anganwadi, etc.)\nPart B with schemes allocating at least 30% of funds for women (for ex: Mid-day meals program, PM POSHAN, etc.)\nSignificance of gender Budgeting\n\nThe main benefit of gender budgeting is the reduction of gender disparities.\n\nModern society still exhibits gender inequality, which is seen in entrepreneurship opportunities, labour participation, pay, education, health outcomes, governance, and employee representation in top management roles.\n\nThese differences show unfair resource distribution even if they may be related to more traditional elements, such as cultural roles for men and women. By ensuring that public policy is developed and implemented in an inclusive manner that recognizes women as important contributors to economic progress, gender budgeting seeks to address these imbalances.\n\nGender budgeting calls for the auditing of public budgets to take into account gender differences. The care of household environments and interpersonal connections is primarily performed by women- is frequently ignored by public budgets.\n\nThe visualization of women\u2019s unpaid effort in social reproduction and its contribution to the general well-being of society is made possible by gender budget auditing.\n\nWhat have Gender Budgets achieved?\n\nThe Gender Budget has been successful in raising awareness of gender issues despite its flaws. The mainstreaming of the notion that a gender lens is significant inside the fiscal discourse is one of the biggest successes of gender-responsive budgeting.\n\nAbout CEDAW: The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\n\nThe CEDAW convention not only prohibits overt acts of discrimination by States but also obliges them to take positive steps to end discrimination against women in all spheres of society, including the public and private sectors and political life.\n\nOn July 9, 1993, India ratified the CEDAW treaty along with two declarative statements. The declaration\u2019s text is as follows:\n\nDeclaration \u2013 1\n\nThe Government of the Republic of India declares that it shall abide by and ensure these provisions in conformity with its policy of non-interference in the personal affairs of any community without its initiative and consent.\n\nDeclaration \u2013 2\n\nThe Government of the Republic of India declares that though in principle it fully supports the principle of compulsory registration of marriage, it is not practical in a vast country like India with its variety of customs, religions, and level of literacy.\n\nThe UN General Assembly adopted the Optional Protocol on October 15, 1999, and it came into effect in December 2000. It is a separate instrument that can be ratified by countries that have already ratified the CEDAW Convention. If justice is not served at the national level, OP-CEDAW gives women access to justice on an international level. Up to this point, India has not ratified OP-CEDAW.\n\nObjectives of State Level Consultation: CEDAW and OP-CEDAW\n\nObjectives of the state-level consultation are:\n\nTo increase knowledge and comprehension of the CEDAW and OP-CEDAW principles among the major players working in the area of women\u2019s rights, empowerment, and development, both in the public and private sectors\n\nTo raise knowledge of the laws against discrimination against women in human rights.\n\nIn news\n\nThe\u00a02024-25 Budget\u00a0emphasises women-led development, with\u00a0Gender Budget\u00a0Statement (GBS)\u00a0allocations reaching\u00a01% of\u00a0Gross Domestic Product(GDP)\u00a0for the first time and pro-women funding exceeding\u00a0\u20b93 lakh crore.\n\nThe GBS, since it was first introduced in 2005-06, consistently reported an average share of 5% of the total budgetary allocations, with marginal ups and downs.\nThis year is special as the share of allocations to pro-women schemes stands at approximately 6.8% of the total budget expenditure for 2024-25, which is way above the usual trends and marks a positive departure from the status quo.\nInclusion of Part C:\u00a0A new section,\u00a0Part C,\u00a0now includes pro-women schemes with\u00a0up to 30% allocation\u00a0for women, such as the\u00a0PM Kisan scheme.\nEarlier the GBS comprised two parts \u2013\u00a0Part A\u00a0reflecting Women Specific Schemes, such as those with\u00a0100% allocation for women such as\u00a0SAMARTHYA, which now accounts for nearly\u00a040% of GBS allocations,\u00a0partly due to the full inclusion of the\u00a0Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY).\nPart B reflects the schemes with 30% to 99% expenditure on women-related components, such as PM AJAY \u2013 Adarsh Gram Yojana.\nWay Forward\n\nGender budgeting strategies should use intersectionality rather than the premise that \u201call women are equal\u201d. Intersectionality refers to the way in which multiple forms of discrimination \u2013 based on gender, race, sexuality, disability, class, etc. overlap and interact with one another.\n\nIn order to address the rising caste-based violence, targeted gender budgeting strategies are also required.\n\nFor example: In the context of South Africa, Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) is a strong strategy for addressing Apartheid\u2019s disparities. In BEE, the issue of how race and gender interact is addressed.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0Gender Justice\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj",

Read to know more about NEER and REER.\n\nWe all are familiar with exchange rates.\n\nWhat is an exchange rate?\n\nIt is the rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another currency.\n\nIn this article, we shall learn more about exchange rates, particularly effective exchange rates.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEffective Exchange Rate (EER)\nNEER\nREER\nDifferences between NEER and REER\nNEER and REER in the Indian context\nConclusion\nEffective Exchange Rate (EER)\n\nEffective Exchange Rate (EER) is a summary indicator of movements of the home currency against a basket of currencies of trading partners.\n\nEffective exchange rates (EERs) serve as a gauge for assessing the fair value of a currency and the external competitiveness of an economy.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt also serves as a guidepost for setting monetary and financial conditions.\n\nThere are of two types of EERs: Nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and Real effective exchange rate (REER).\n\nNEER\n\nThe Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) is an index of the weighted average of bilateral exchange rates of home currency with respect to a basket of currencies of trading partners.\n\nIt is also known as the trade-weighted currency index.\n\nThe important aspect of NEER is that it is not adjusted for inflation. Thus, it does not say anything about the real strength of a currency; it is just a relative value.\n\nHowever, it can be used to measure the relative strength of different currencies.\n\nAn increase in NEER indicates that the domestic currency has appreciated against the basket of currencies whereas a decrease indicates a relative depreciation.\n\nThere is no fixed standard used to determine the basket of currencies.\n\nThe OECD basket is different from that of the IMF or that of the US Federal Reserve. Most of the institutions rely on the IMF\u2019s basket of currencies.\n\nREER\n\nThe Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is the NEER adjusted by inflation differentials between the domestic currency and that of the trading partners.\n\nThus, it says about the real strength of a domestic currency against a basket of currencies, unlike NEER.\n\nDifferences between NEER and REER\nNEER\n\t\nREER\n\n\nIt reflects the relative value of a currency with respect to that of the trading partners\n\t\nIt reflects the inflation-adjusted value of a currency with respect to that of the trading partners\n\n\nIt is calculated based on a basket of currencies\n\t\nIt is calculated based on NEER\n\n\nIt is not an accurate measure of a currency\u2019s strength as it is not adjusted for inflation differential\n\t\nIt is considered a more accurate measure to gauge a currency\u2019s strength\nNEER and REER in the Indian context\n\nThe Reserve Bank compiles and disseminates indices of NEER and REER of the Indian rupee.\n\nThe latest series was constructed with the base year 2015-16. The new indices of NEER and REER replaced the old series from 2004-05 onwards.\n\nThe coverage of the NEER and REER basket has been expanded from 36 to 40 currencies. This was in view of the growing importance of emerging markets and developing economies in India\u2019s foreign trade and to better reflect shifts in external competitiveness.\n\nThe selection of currencies for NEER and REER in the new series is based on two criteria:\n\nTrading partners with extremely high and volatile inflation are excluded. This is because their currencies tend to experience rapid nominal declines, undermining the stability of the NEER and REER indices. This obscures their usefulness in the assessment of external competitiveness.\nData on inflation and exchange rates of trading partners should be available on a regular basis.\nConclusion\n\nSince the adoption of floating exchange rates, NEER and REER have become instrumental in analyzing the competitiveness of a country\u2019s economy.\n\nIt is also quite significant from the perspective of policymakers, especially in the light of the under or over-evaluation of currencies leading to many global trade disputes.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline Abraham",

The mission is:\n\nEfficient procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP), storage, and distribution of food grains.\nEnsuring availability of food grains and sugar through appropriate policy instruments; including maintenance of buffer stocks of food grains.\nMaking food grains accessible at reasonable prices, especially to the weak errand vulnerable sections of the society under PDS.\nFunctions of Food Corporation of India (FCI)\n\nIt has primary duty to undertake purchase, store, move/transport, distribute and sell food grains and other food items.\n\nFCI thrives to transform food security into a stable security system to ensure availability, accessibility, and affordability of food grains to all people at all times so that no one, nowhere, and at no time should go hungry.\n\nProcurement: The Central Government extends price support for the procurement of wheat, paddy, and coarse grains through the FCI and State Agencies.\n\nAll the food grains conforming to the prescribed specifications are procured by the public procurement agencies at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) plus the incentive bonus announced.\nFCI has also been nominated as an additional nodal Agency for the procurement of Pulses and Oilseeds.\n\nDecentralized Procurement Scheme (DCP): It was introduced in 1997-98 for food grains to be procured and distributed by the state governments themselves.\n\nThe designated States procure, store and issue food grains under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) and other welfare schemes of the Government.\n\nQuality control: The quality Control Division of FCI ensures the procurement of food grains from procurement centers strictly by Govt. of India\u2019s uniform quality specifications.\n\nDistribution: FCI meets the requirements of TPDS through grains procured which are issued at a Central Issue Price fixed by Government.\n\nFCI delivers food grains to State Agencies from its base depots for distribution through Fair Price Shops.\n\nThe role of FCI is important as the National Food Security Act, 2013 commits to distributing grains through TPDS and other welfare schemes at highly subsidized prices.\n\nPublic distribution system: Public Distribution System (PDS) evolved as a system for the distribution of food grains at affordable prices and management of emergencies.\n\nThe center is responsible for procuring the food grains from farmers at a\u00a0Minimum Support Price (MSP).\nThe MSP is the price at which the FCI purchases the crop directly from farmers; generally, the MSP is higher than the market price.\nThe MSP is set by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).\n\nPDS is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and State Governments. The Central Government, through FCI, has assumed the responsibility for procurement, storage, transportation, and bulk allocation of food grains to the State Governments.\n\nCommission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP)\n\nThe Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP) is an attached office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India.\n\nIt came into existence in January 1965.\n\nThe Commission comprises a Chairman, Member Secretary, one Member (Official), and two Members (Non-Official).\n\nThe non-official members are representatives of the farming community and usually have an active association with the farming community.\nFunctions of CACP:\nIt is mandated to recommend minimum support prices (MSPs) to incentivize the cultivators to adopt modern technology and raise productivity and overall grain production in line with the emerging demand patterns in the country.\nMSP for major agricultural products is fixed by the government, each year, after taking into account the recommendations of the Commission.\nAs of now, CACP recommends MSPs of 23 commodities, which comprise 7 kinds of cereal (paddy, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, barley, and ragi), 5 pulses (gram, tur, moong, urad, lentil), 7 oilseeds (groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, soybean, sesamum, sunflower, safflower, nigerseed), and 4 commercial crops (copra, sugarcane, cotton and raw jute).\n\nCACP submits its recommendations to the government in the form of Price Policy Reports every year, separately for five groups of commodities namely:\n\nKharif crops\nRabi crops\nSugarcane\nRaw Jute\nCopra\n\nBefore preparing the aforesaid five pricing policy reports, the Commission draws a comprehensive questionnaire and sends it to all the state governments and concerned National organizations and Ministries to seek their views.\n\nSeparate meetings are also held with farmers from different states, state governments, and National organizations like Food Corporation of India (FCI), NAFED, Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), Jute Corporation of India (JCI), trader\u2019s organizations, processing organizations, and key central Ministries.\nThe Commission also makes visits to states for on-the-spot assessment of the various constraints that farmers face in marketing their products or even raising the productivity levels of their crops.\n\nBased on all these inputs, the Commission then finalizes its recommendations/reports, which are then submitted to the government.\n\nThe government, in turn, circulates the CACP reports to state governments and concerned central Ministries for their comments.\n\nAfter receiving the feedback from them, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) of the Union government takes a final decision on the level of MSPs and other recommendations made by the CACP.\n\nOnce this decision is taken, CACP puts all its reports on the website for various stakeholders to see the rationale behind CACP\u2019s price and non-price recommendations.\n\nIssues with FCI and recommendations for improvement\n\nFood Corporation of India has been marred by numerous shortfalls over the years in the areas of timely procurement, storage, and distribution.\n\nThis led to the formation of a high-level committee (HLC) led by Shanta Kumar for restructuring FCI. The committee recommendations were:\n\nProcurement: The committee recommended that all procurement made by the FCI should be handed over to the states that gained experience in this matter and created the necessary infrastructure for the same\nNegotiable warehouse receipt system: A warehouse receipt system should be made negotiable as this can help farmers deposit their produce at the registered warehouses. They can then sell it at a price suitable for them and at the same time reduce the cost of storage for the government.\nRevision of the MSP Policy: The HLC recommended that pulses and oilseeds should also be in the MSP category. At present MSP for 23 commodities are announced with priority given to wheat and rice, but the MSP was applicable in only selected states. The present arrangement creates a disproportionate price structure that favors wheat and rice.\nStorage and movement: HLC recommended that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) should outsource its stocking operations to various agencies such as Central Warehousing Corporation, State Warehousing Corporation, the Private Sector under the Private Entrepreneur Guarantee (PEG) scheme, and even state governments that are building silos through a private sector on state lands.\nThe committee had recommended that the government should relook at the coverage (67% of the population) under the NFSA as it\u2019s on the \u2018higher\u2019 side.",

    "[CONTENT] #1008": "Animal rearing is an important aspect of the Indian agricultural sector. Read here to know more about the significance of the economics of animal rearing in India.\n\nLivestock or animal rearing plays an important role in the Indian economy because about 20.5 million people depend upon livestock for their livelihood. Livestock provides livelihood to two-thirds of rural communities in India.\n\nIndia has a rich heritage of animal rearing. It is home to several breeds of cattle, small ruminants, fowl, pigs, and equine species among others.\n\nLivestock contributes about 16% to the income of small farm households as against an average of 14% for all rural households. It also employs about 8.8 % of the population in India.\n\nIndia has vast livestock resources and the sector contributes 4.11% to total GDP and 25.6% of total Agriculture GDP.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is animal rearing?\nSignificance of animal rearing in India\nImportance of animal rearing in farmers\u2019 economy\nChanges in the animal-rearing system\nImportant Initiatives by the Government\nWay forward\nWhat is animal rearing?\n\nAnimal rearing is considered an integral part of agricultural activities in rural India. The diversity in breeds is based on traditional selection methods.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSome of the selection criteria considered in the traditional breeding systems include the ability of the animals too:\n\nwithstand heat and\u00a0humidity,\nto resist diseases,\nto cope with feed stress,\nto\u00a0walk and graze forages,\nto utilize a range of forages and,\nto survive for longer periods.\n\nThe\u00a0objective\u00a0of animal rearing is to make the livestock useful for human beings for a variety of purposes with economic value. Therefore, it provides non-farm employment and income in rural areas.\n\nThe animal production system in India is part of a mixed crop-livestock farming system and is important for the security of the rural populace.\n\nSignificance of animal rearing in India\n\nAnimal rearing is integrated with the natural environment to a great extent, less dependent on purchased inputs and external factors. As a result, animal rearing, even during the down performance of agriculture, contributes nearly 40% of the rural GDP across India.\n\nAnother key factor is, that in arid and semi-arid regions of India, agriculture is possible only for three to six months during the monsoon period and high-cost irrigation investments are beyond the reach of most the farmers. Thus, for a large percentage of the rural populace cattle rearing provides a steady income.\n\nThe diversity of breeds itself is a certain risk mitigation characteristic; as animals are bred to fulfill a wide array of characteristics.\n\nAccording to the Livestock census, India is\n\nWorld\u2019s highest livestock owner at about 535.78 million\nFirst in the total buffalo population in the world \u2013 109.85 million buffaloes\nSecond in the population of goats \u2013 148.88 million goats\nSecond largest poultry market in the world\nThe second-largest producer of fish and also the second-largest aquaculture nation in the world\nThird in the population of sheep (74.26 million)\nFifth in the population of ducks and chickens (851.81 million)\nTenth in camel population in the world \u2013 2.5 lakhs\nImportance of animal rearing in farmers\u2019 economy\n\nThe farmers in India maintain a mixed farming system i.e. a combination of crop and livestock where the output of one enterprise becomes the input of another enterprise thereby realizing resource efficiency.\n\nThe livestock serves the farmers in different ways:\n\nFood\n\nThe livestock provides food items such as Milk, Meat, and Eggs for human consumption. India is the number one milk producer in the world.\n\nFibre and skins:\n\nThe livestock also contributes to the production of wool, hair, hides, and pelts. Leather is the most important product which has very high export potential. India is producing about 41.5 million Kg of wool per annum\n\nAnimals for agricultural operations and transport\n\nBullocks are the backbone of Indian agriculture. Despite a lot of advancements in the use of mechanical power in Indian agricultural operations, the Indian farmer especially in rural areas still depends upon bullocks for various agricultural operations.\nThe bullocks are saving a lot on fuel which is a necessary input for using mechanical power like tractors, combine harvesters, etc\nPack animals like camels, horses, donkeys, ponies, mules, etc are being extensively used to transport goods in different parts of the country in addition to bullocks.\nIn situations like hilly terrains, mules and ponies serve as the only alternative to transport goods.\nSimilarly, the army has to depend upon these animals to transport various items in high areas of high altitudes.\n\nAnimal waste\n\nDung and other animal wastes serve as very good farm yard manure and have a great monetary value.\nIn addition, it is also used as fuel (biogas, dung cakes), and for construction purposes in rural areas.\n\nLivestock as asset\n\nLivestock is considered as \u2018moving banks\u2019 because of their potential to dispose of during emergencies.\nThey serve as capital and in cases of landless agricultural laborers many times it is the only capital resource they possess.\nLivestock serves as an asset and in case of emergencies, they serve as a guarantee for availing loans from the local sources such as money lenders in the villages.\n\nWeed control\n\nLivestock is also used for biological control of brush, plants, and weeds as cattle graze off the weeds.\n\nSocio-cultural importance\n\nLivestock has been part of generations of pastoral communities in India and the special knowledge of animal rearing has evolved over the centuries.\nThey have been responsible for developing and conserving domestic animal diversity with important genetic traits.\n\nMilk marketing network\n\nMilk marketing has a significant role in the rural economy. The sale of milk does help family farms to get regular income, though not high profits.\n\nAlso read: Sustainable Livestock Production\n\nChanges in the animal-rearing system\n\nAs in the case of agriculture, the animal rearing system is witnessing a rapid movement toward an intensive production model characterized by a focus on one trait or breed; production of milk through heavy doses of external inputs like feed concentrates and other enhancing chemicals like antibiotics, probiotics, etc.\n\nStatistically, such a system is unsustainable and the cost of external inputs pushes the animal rearers out of the vocation.\n\nThe whole system is protected enormously by subsidies. India is pushing itself into this trap with a focus on an intensive production system.\n\nUshering in such a production system into India has the potential to push out traditional breeds and increase the dependence on inputs like concentrates, medicines, and genetic inputs like imported semen of exotic bulls, thereby increasing the costs of production.\nSuch a system is unsuitable for the agro-climatic conditions of India.\n\nThe aspect of cross-breeding is also on the rise and its usage is specifically considering the availability of resources, educational and social status of farmers, and climatic conditions.\n\nThe excessive focus on exotic breeds ignores evidence from the field which points to progressively stagnating milk production and returns from crossbreeds.\nImportant Initiatives by the Government\n\nRashtriya Gokul Mission: To develop and conserve indigenous breeds of the bovine population enhance milk production and make it more remunerative to the farmers.\n\nNational Livestock Mission: To ensure quantitative and qualitative improvement in livestock production systems and capacity building of all stakeholders.\n\nNational Artificial Insemination Programme: To suggest novel methods of bringing about impregnation in female breeds. And to prevent the spread of certain diseases which are genital, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the breed.\n\nNational Cattle and Buffalo Breeding Project: To genetically upgrade important indigenous breeds on a priority basis with a focus on development and conservation.\n\nAnimal Husbandry Startup Grand Challenge: To appreciate innovations coming from the villages to expand the dairy sector in India.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe economics of animal rearing is an important aspect of the developmental policies of India\u2019s economy. Hence more measures can be used to promote the well-being of the system:\n\nincorporating seeds that yield good edible biomass in our agricultural practices;\nmaking the right choice in introducing cattle/ buffalo breeds in different agro-climatic regions;\nin western India, high-yielding milk breeds can be used in pure form or could be used for upgrading cattle in the local or adjoining areas;\npromoting milk recording at farmers\u2019 gate;\nselection of bulls for higher milk yields needs to be simultaneously carried out;\nidentifying possible breeds which may already exist in different areas;\npromoting milk yield competitions in different regions for identifying good milk-yielding cows\n\nThis will be a slow and time-consuming process but, ultimately will give a solid indigenous base with all the good genetic characteristics.",

    "[CONTENT] #1011": "Surety Bonds are a new concept in India and recently IRDAI has released guidelines for it. Read here to know the pros, cons, and significance of them.\n\nIn Budget 2022-23, the government has allowed the use of surety insurance bonds as a substitute for bank guarantees in case of government procurement and also for gold imports.\n\nRecently the Ministry for Road Transport & Highways (MORTH) has asked insurance regulator Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) to develop a model product on Surety Bonds in consultation with general insurers.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a surety bond?\nTypes of surety bonds\nAdvantages of surety bonds\nDisadvantages\nIRDAI Guidelines on Surety Bonds\nWay forward\nWhat is a surety bond?\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nA surety bond is defined as a three-party agreement that legally binds together a principal who needs the bond, an obligee who requires the bond, and a surety company that sells the bond.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe bond guarantees the principal will act by certain laws.\nIf the principal fails to perform in this manner, the bond will cover the resulting damages or losses.\n\nThe obligee, usually a government entity, requires the principal, typically a business owner or contractor, to obtain a surety bond as a guarantee against future work performance.\n\nA surety bond is provided by the insurance company on behalf of the contractor to the entity which is awarding the project.\n\nThese bonds are mainly aimed at infrastructure development to reduce indirect costs for suppliers and contractors.\nThis helps in the diversification of options hence acting as a substitute for a bank guarantee.\nTypes of surety bonds\nBid bond: It provides financial protection to an obligee if a bidder is awarded a contract under the bid documents, but fails to sign the contract and provide any required performance and payment bonds.\nPerformance bond: It assures that the obligee will be protected if the principal or contractor fails to perform the bonded contract. If the obligee declares the principal or contractor as being in default and terminates the contract, it can call on the Surety to meet the obligations under the bond.\nPayment bond: Bond assures that the contractor will pay certain subcontractors, laborers, and materials suppliers associated with the project.\nAdvantages of surety bonds\n\nThere are many benefits of contract surety bonds:\n\nAs an impartial third party, the surety prequalifies the contractor to verify that the contractor is capable and qualified.\nThe owner has the assurance of project completion, however, many things can cause contractors to default, and in that event, the surety bond offers protection against financial loss.\nIf the contractor requests help, the surety may offer technical, managerial, or financial assistance. This can help the project move forward and significantly reduce the likelihood of default.\nThese bonds protect the beneficiary\u00a0against acts or events that impair the underlying obligations of the principal.\nThey\u00a0guarantee the performance\u00a0from construction or service contracts to licensing and commercial undertakings.\nSurety bonds protect taxpayer dollars on public projects.\nWhen subcontractors and suppliers know they are protected by a payment bond, they may present lower quotes since they no longer have to absorb the risk of nonpayment.\n\nFor infrastructure projects:\n\nThe large liquidity and funding requirements of the infrastructure sector can be addressed with surety bonds.\n\nThe Surety bonds will assist in developing an alternative to bank guarantees for construction projects. This will enable the efficient use of working capital and reduce the requirement of collateral\u00a0to be provided by construction companies.\n\nInsurers will work together with financial institutions to share risk information which will assist in releasing liquidity in the infrastructure space without compromising on risk aspects.\n\nDisadvantages\nBonded parties must pay for bonds and any valid claims\nA lapse in bond coverage can invalidate a license or contract\nRequired bonds renewals can add ongoing costs and hassle\n\nSurety bonds are a new concept in India hence are risky as insurance companies here are yet to achieve expertise in risk assessment in such business.\n\nThere is no clarity on pricing, the recourse available against defaulting contractors, and reinsurance options.\nThese are critical and may impede the creation of surety-related expertise and capacities and eventually deter insurers from writing this class of businesses.\nIRDAI Guidelines on Surety Bonds\n\nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) (Surety Insurance Contracts) Guidelines, 2022 came into force in April 2022.\n\nThe premium charged for all surety insurance policies underwritten in a financial year, including all installments due in subsequent years for those policies, should not exceed 10% of the total gross written premium of that year, subject to a maximum of Rs 500 crore.\nInsurers can issue contract bonds, which assure the public entity, developers, subcontractors, and suppliers that the contractor will fulfill its contractual obligation when undertaking the project.\nContract bonds may include Bid Bonds, Performance Bonds, Advance Payment Bonds, and Retention Money.\nThe limit of the guarantee should not exceed 30% of the contract value.\nSurety Insurance contracts\u00a0should be issued only to specific projects and not clubbed for multiple projects.\nWay forward\n\nMost general insurers are still apprehensive and are seeking more clarity on the structure and pricing of these bonds before moving ahead.\n\nThere are also concerns about defaulting, reinsurance support, experience, and capacity to underwrite such bonds.\n\nThe major concern is that general insurers do not have the same understanding of customers as banks do. There also needs to have clarity on whether these bonds fall under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.\n\nHence, more elaborate and clearer guidelines will encourage general insurers to adopt the surety bonds.",

This includes the internet and related information technologies, and digital technologies, used of which have grown rapidly in recent years in all fields.\n\nThe impact of information and communication technology in agriculture can be evaluated broadly under two categories.\n\nFirst, Information technology is a tool for direct contribution to agricultural productivity.\nSecondly, as an indirect tool for empowering agriculturalists to make informed and quality decisions, it will have a positive impact on the agriculture and allied activities conducted.\n\nAgricultural biotech and InfoTech together are helping to create new tools to-\n\ntackle the problem of consistent rural poverty\ngenerate employment,\nincrease farm productivity and production,\nimprove quality and marketing\n\nBeneficial outcomes of e-Agriculture which enhance the quality of life of farmers include-\n\nbridging the information gap between the farmers and\nbuilding a productive and competitive market,\nDifferent IT interventions support rural and under-developed markets to become efficient and pesticides.\nFarm animals are fed and monitored by electronic sensors and identification systems.\nAccess to price information, access to agriculture information, access to national and international markets,\nIncreasing production efficiency and so on.\nAdvantages of E-technology in aid of farmers\n\nSome of the benefits derived by the farmers through ICT are given below:\n\nImproved decision making: By having the necessary information, farmers make improved decisions concerning their agricultural activities. The exchange of knowledge from various countries and organizations also helps farmers be more aware of factors to consider before making their decisions.\nPlanning: IT has paved the way to come up with farming software that determines the best aids to use on the farm. Gaining information from their farm is essential in sustaining growth.\nCommunity participation: When a community adopts modern methods for agriculture, the production of local goods can be increased. With IT, there can be an improved union among local farmers, leading to better income for everyone involved.\nAgricultural innovations: When scientists develop new and improved techniques that help grow crops in adversities, a connected agricultural world will promote better reach.\nBetter outreach: Not only small and medium farmers, but even backyard farmers also play a role in promoting agriculture. USe of e-technology will help in spreading ideas and innovations to all levels of farming sects.\n\nAlong with the advantages, e-agriculture has lots of problems like technical feasibility of connectivity in rural areas, cost involved in ensuring services, need for basic computer literacy, etc. Some of those problems are:-\n\nThe reach of the technology is still very poor and a large number of farmers are still ignorant about such advancements.\nThe distribution of technologies is not uniform throughout the country.\nThe use of technology is being used by the already big-scale farmers is pushing the wealth gap wider. The small and marginal farmers are again being left out in the process of development.\nDue to the low literacy rate among farmers and the digital divide, there is a rise of a new class of middlemen, who provide ICT services to farmers.\nThe rural infrastructure for the use of ICT is also not uniform and a lot of regional disparity persists.\nInitiatives by the Central Government for promoting E-technology in aid of farmers\n\nThere are many initiatives of the Central Government integrating electronic technology and farming.\n\nNational Agriculture Market\nThe National Agriculture Market (NAM) is a pan-India electronic trading portal that seeks to network the existing APMC and other market yards to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities.\nNAM is a \u201cvirtual\u201d market, but it has a physical market at the backend.\nNAM was announced during the\u00a0Budget of 2014-15\u00a0and is proposed to be achieved through the setting up of a common e-platform to which initially 585 APMCs selected by the states are linked. NAM was launched on 14 April 2016 with 21 mandis from 8 States joining it and the first phase of connecting 250 mandis was over on 6 October 2016.\nNAM is implemented as a\u00a0Centrally Sponsored Scheme\u00a0through Agri-Tech Infrastructure Fund (ATIF). The\u00a0Department of Agriculture & Cooperation\u00a0(DAC), Ministry of Agriculture will set it up through the\u00a0Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium\u00a0(SFAC).\nAGMARKNET\nThe Agricultural Marketing Information Network (AGMARKNET) was launched in 2000 by the Union Ministry of Agriculture.\nThis e-governance portal AGMARKNET, implemented by National Informatics Centre (NIC), facilitates the generation and transmission of prices, commodity arrival information from agricultural produce markets, and web-based dissemination to producers, consumers, traders, and policymakers transparently and quickly.\ne-choupal\nAn initiative by ITC provides alternative marketing channels, information on weather, agricultural practices, input sales, etc.\nIt is a kiosk located in a village and equipped with computer and internet access, which is managed by a trained sanchalak.\nDirect benefit transfer (DBT) Central Agri Portal\nLaunched in 2013, the DBT Agri Portal is a unified central portal for agricultural schemes across the country\nThe portal helps farmers adopt modern farm machinery through government subsidies.\nVillage Resource Centres\nVillage Resource Centres provide space-based services in rural areas.\nThey are one of the unique initiatives that use the Satellite Communication (SATCOM) network and Earth Observation (EO) satellite data to reach out to the villages to address the needs of the local people in the villages themselves.\nDigital Agriculture Mission\nThe Digital Agriculture Mission (2021\u20132025) aims to support and accelerate projects based on new technologies, like AI, blockchain, remote sensing, and GIS technology, and the use of drones and robots\n\nRead:\u00a0New Schemes for Farmers\n\nUnified Farmer Service Platform (UFSP):\nUFSP is a combination of Core Infrastructure, Data, Applications, and Tools that enable seamless interoperability of various public and private IT systems in the agriculture ecosystem across the country. UFSP is envisaged to play the following role:\nAct as a central agency in the Agri ecosystem (like UPI in the e-Payments)\nEnables Registration of the Service Providers (public and private) and the Farmer Services.\nEnforces various rules and validations required during the service delivery process.\nActs as a Repository of all the applicable standards, APIs (Application Programming Interface), and formats.\nAct as a medium of data exchange amongst various schemes and services to enable comprehensive delivery of services to the farmer\nAgriStack\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has planned to create \u2018AgriStack\u2019 \u2013 a collection of technology-based interventions in agriculture.\nIt will create a unified platform for farmers to provide them with end-to-end services across the agricultural food value chain.\nSandesh Pathak\nThe Sandesh Pathak application was developed jointly by C-DAC Mumbai, IIT-Madras, IIIT Hyderabad, IIT Kharagpur, and C-DAC Thiruvananthapuram will enable SMS messages to be read out loud, for the benefit of farmers who may have difficulty in reading.\nState-level initiatives connected with Electronic Technology and Farmers\n\nThere are many programs in different states which integrates e-technology with agricultural practices. Some of them are:\n\neSagu\neSagu provides personalized expert advice promptly from the sowing stage to harvest for small and marginal farmers at their doorstep.\nThe farm situation is brought to the expert in the form of digital photographs and text information.\nThe expert advice after analyzing the situation is prepared and is delivered to the concerned farmer on the same day or subsequent day.\nSagu means cultivation in the Telugu-local language of Telangana Andhra Pradesh, the region in which the project started.\nAGRISNET\nThe AGRISNET project was conceptualized with the vision of creating an interconnected technology-enabled network to deliver informational services effectively to the farming community.\nThe project aimed to integrate cross-functional processes of the Department of Agriculture in Tamilnadu, to effectively and efficiently communicate informational services to the farming community.\nJio Agri(JioKrishi) Platform\nA pilot project was initiated at Jalna and Nashik, Maharashtra in 2020.\nIt digitizes the agricultural ecosystem along the entire value chain to empower farmers\nThe core function of the platform uses stand-alone application data to provide advisory, the advanced functions use data from various sources, feed the data into AI/ML algorithms, and provide accurate personalized advice.\nConclusion\n\nThe Indian agriculture sector has still not been able to overcome the digital divide that is prevalent for so many years in rural development scenarios. Hence, it is high time to fill the digital gap for farmers.\n\nIt is important to adopt a holistic approach to address the challenges faced by Indian agriculture to achieve inclusive growth and sustainable development.\n\nThe use of e-technology like remote sensing, and GIS, will enable wide-scale adoption of digital agriculture, ease of access and operations, and easy maintenance of systems with supportive government policies.",

Though it provides more opportunities to people, it still lacks social security for the employed.\n\nUrban and rural divide:\n\nRural India is facing agricultural backwardness majorly due to declining per capita land availability and yield due to climate change, land degradation, etc.\nThere are significant regional and social disparities between the urban and rural populations and the divide was widened by digital advancement as well.\n\nSocial issues:\n\nSocial issues like gender disparity, caste system, and religious disparity are also causing hindrance to inclusive growth.\nMalnutrition among children is another worry affecting the future of the country.\nMeasurement of inclusive growth\n\nInclusive Development Index (IDI)\n\nThe Inclusive Development Index (IDI) was compiled by the World Economic Forum (WEF).\nThe IDI is based on the idea that most people base their country\u2019s growth not on GDP but on their standard of living.\nIt gives a measure of inequality based on three parameters: Growth and development, Inclusion, and Inter-generational equity and sustainability.\n\nSocial Progress Index (SPI)\n\nIt is an aggregate index of social and environmental indicators that includes- Basic human needs, Foundation of well-being, and Opportunities.\nSPI measures the outcomes of the government measures rather than money spent.

The MGNREGA provides a legal guarantee for one hundred days of employment in every financial year to adult members of any rural household willing to do public work-related unskilled manual work at the statutory minimum wage. The\u00a0Ministry of Rural Development\u00a0(MRD), Govt of India is monitoring the entire implementation of this scheme in association with state governments\n\nPrime Minister\u2019s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP): The scheme is implemented by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) functioning as the nodal agency at the national level. At the state level, the scheme is implemented through State KVIC Directorates, State Khadi and Village Industries Boards (KVIBs), District Industries Centres (DICs), and banks. In such cases, KVIC routes government subsidies through designated banks for eventual disbursal to the beneficiaries/entrepreneurs directly into their bank accounts.\n\nMudra Bank scheme: Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a scheme launched in 2015 for providing loans up to 10 lakh to the non-corporate, non-farm small/micro-enterprises. These loans are classified as MUDRA loans under PMMY. These loans are given by Commercial Banks, RRBs, Small Finance Banks, MFIs, and NBFCs.\n\nPt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY): It aims to skill rural youth who are poor and provide them with jobs having regular monthly wages or above the minimum wages. It is one of the clusters of initiatives of the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India that seeks to promote rural livelihoods. It is a part of the\u00a0National Rural Livelihood Mission\u00a0(NRLM) \u2013 the Mission for poverty reduction called\u00a0Aajeevika. The scheme will benefit more than 55 million poor rural youth who are ready to be skilled by providing sustainable employment.\n\nThis scheme derives importance from its potential to reduce poverty. It is also designed to be a major contributor to the Prime Minister\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2018 campaign.\n\nDeendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM): The mission would aim at providing shelters equipped with essential services to the urban homeless in a phased manner. In addition, the mission would also address the livelihood concerns of the urban street vendors by facilitating access to suitable spaces, institutional credit, social security, and skills to the urban street vendors for accessing emerging market opportunities.\n\nSarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA): Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is the Government of India\u2019s flagship program for the achievement of Universalization of Elementary Education (UEE) in a time-bound manner, as mandated by the 86th amendment to the Constitution of India making free and compulsory Education to the Children of 6-14 years age group, a Fundamental Right.\n\nNational Rural Health Mission (NRHM): The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005, to provide accessible, affordable, and quality health care to the rural population, especially the vulnerable groups.\n\nSwachh Bharat Mission: To ensure that open defecation-free behavior is sustained, no one is left behind, and that solid and liquid waste management facilities are accessible, the Mission is moving towards the next Phase II of SBMG i.e. ODF-Plus. ODF Plus activities under Phase II of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) will reinforce ODF behaviors and focus on providing interventions for the safe management of solid and liquid waste in villages.\n\nMission Ayushman: The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) aims to develop the backbone necessary to support the integrated digital health infrastructure of the country. It will bridge the existing gap among different stakeholders of the Healthcare ecosystem through digital highways.\n\nPradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana: PMJDY is the National Mission for Financial Inclusion to ensure access to financial services, namely, basic savings & deposit accounts, remittance, credit, insurance, and pension in an affordable manner. Under the scheme, a basic savings bank deposit (BSBD) account can be opened in any bank branch or Business Correspondent (Bank Mitra) outlet, by persons not having any other account.\n\nDISHA Project is being implemented in partnership with UNDP to create employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for women in India.\n\nRead:\u00a0PM SVANidhi Scheme\n\nWay forward\n\nIndia\u2019s economic growth has not been well reflected in the real-time development on the ground which pushes back the aim to achieve complete inclusive growth. More steps need to be taken to make inclusive growth the target of development.\n\nIssues like social and regional disparity, rural and urban divide, malnutrition, poverty, etc, are being addressed via various schemes and projects but need more impetus.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis was a dramatic wake-up call. Growth as we know it doesn\u2019t work for all and is putting everyone\u2019s well-being at risk. We need to develop new and improved models and focus on ensuring growth improves lives.\n\nPeople would feel more motivated and involved if the benefits of economic growth were not allowed to flow into the pockets of a rich minority. This can be achieved by a few simpler steps like-\n\nMaking our tax systems fairer and more effective\nEnsuring people can earn the wages they need to thrive\nCreating a business environment that attracts new firms and boosts communities\n\nOn a global scale, some social groups and territories, even in rich countries, have been left out for decades and need support. With the right policies and investments in essential public services, we can build more cohesive societies and bridge the divides that threaten our future prosperity.\n\nMost importantly, we need to anticipate the radical changes induced by globalization, digitalization, and demographic shift and target them by answering questions like:\n\nHow can we build the skills of tomorrow\u2019s workforce?\nHow can we support risk-taking and entrepreneurship while safeguarding job quality, collective bargaining, and social protection?\nHow do we integrate the growing number of migrants to enhance solidarity, performance, and cohesion in our societies?\n\nIn the end, inclusive growth has to start from the grassroots level, hence targeting the basic issues is key. Nowadays, large numbers of people are losing faith in their institutions. This trend can be reversed if public authorities demonstrate the highest standards of integrity and efficiency in their work, and promote more transparency and public participation.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Rights of Persons with Disabilities; Corporate driven Inequality\n\n\u00a0",

    "[CONTENT] #1020": "Ways and means advances are a loan facility provided by RBI which is often in news. Read here to know more about this economic concept.\n\nGiven the improvement in the pandemic situation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to reduce the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) for States and Union Territories (UTs) to \u20b947,010 crores from \u20b951,560 crores.\n\nConsidering the uncertainties related to COVID-19, the RBI had raised the WMA limit to \u20b951,560 crores for all States. The higher WMA was applicable till March 31, 2022.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow the central government meets the temporary cash needs?\nWhat are Ways and means advances (WMA)?\nTypes of Ways and Means Advances:\nWMA Limits:\nSignificance of WMA scheme\nConcerns against Ways and Means Advances scheme\nConclusion\nProbable question:\nHow the central government meets the temporary cash needs?\n\nThe fund deficit or cash-flow mismatches of the Government are largely managed through:\n\nIssuance of\u00a0Treasury Bills,\nGetting temporary loans from the RBI called Ways and Means Advances (WMA) and;\nIssuance of\u00a0Cash Management Bills.\nWhat are Ways and means advances (WMA)?\n\nWays and means advances are special features of the Indian economy. WMA are temporary advances given by the RBI to the centre and state governments to tide over any mismatch in receipts and payments.\n\nIt was introduced in 1997 and comes under Section 17(5) of the RBI Act of 1934.\nIt was introduced to end the four-decade-old system of ad-hoc treasury bills to finance the central government deficit.\n\nStates and centre pay interest linked to the repo rate on WMA withdrawals.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe government can avail of immediate cash from the RBI is required. But it has to return the amount within 90 days. Interest is charged at the existing repo rate.\n\nIf the WMA exceeds 90 days, it would be treated as an overdraft (the interest rate on overdrafts is 2 percentage points more than the repo rate).\n\nWMA is not part of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) because they get paid within the year itself.\n\nTypes of Ways and Means Advances:\n\nThere are two types of WMAs- normal and special.\n\nNormal WMAs are clean advances special WMA are secured advances provided against the pledge of the Government of India dated securities.\n\nThe number of loans under normal WMA is based on a three-year average of actual revenue and capital expenditure of the state.\n\nSpecial WMA is also called Special drawing rights (SDF) and is provided against the collateral of government securities held by the state.\n\nThe operative limit for special WMA for a State is subject to its holdings of Central Government dated securities up to a maximum of the limit sanctioned.\nThe interest rate for SDF is one percentage point less than the repo rate.\nAfter the state has exhausted the limit, it gets normal WMA.\nWMA Limits:\n\nThe limits for Ways and Means Advances are decided by the government and RBI mutually and revised periodically.\n\nThere is a state-wise limit for the funds that can be availed via WMA which depends on factors like total expenditure, revenue deficit, and fiscal position of the state.\n\nAnother factor that will add to the SDF loan limit of the state government is the incremental investment in Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) /Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF).\n\nIn addition to WMA, the Overdraft facility is also provided whenever financial accommodation to a state exceeds its SDF and WMA limits.\n\nThe withdrawal above the WMA limit is considered an overdraft. A State Government account can be in overdraft for a maximum of 14 consecutive working days with a limit of 36 days in a quarter.\nGenerally, the interest rate for overdraft is repo plus 2% given that it comes under the WMA limit.\nSignificance of WMA scheme\n\nThere are times of economic stress on governments, especially in situations like the Covid-19 pandemic. Ways and means advances are a scheme that relieves the financial stress on the government in the worst times.\n\nAs frontline fighters against Covid-19, many States needed immediate and large financial resources to deal with challenges, including medical testing, screening, and providing income and food security to the needy.\n\nWhen tax receipts are unpredictable owing to adverse economic conditions, the increased WMA limit allows states to borrow short-term cash from the RBI, providing a financial cushion.\n\nThe increased override limit of WMA enables states to borrow money from RBI on a short-term basis if the states are facing a budget deficit.\n\nWMA funding is cheaper than borrowings from markets or other schemes because it has a longer maturity date, and its interest rate is also lower.\n\nWMA can be an alternative to raising longer-tenure funds from the markets, issuing State government securities (State development loans), or borrowing from financial institutions for short-term funding.\n\nConcerns against Ways and Means Advances scheme\n\nSome states voiced concerns that increasing WMA limits would not be sufficient and demanded a moratorium on loans and interest for nine months.\n\nFew states also complained about the short window to repay (90 days).\n\nThe WMA window is intended only to tide over temporary mismatches in the cash flow of receipts and payments.\n\nConclusion\n\nWays and Means advances are meant to pass over temporary mismatches in the cash flow of receipts and payments and are not a source of permanent financial relief. It provides leverage for both the centre and the states to borrow from the RBI and it, therefore, helps to meet the receipts and payments of the government.\n\nProbable question:\n\nConsider the following statements regarding Ways and Means Advances:\n1. It is a long-term loan facility for the government with RBI.\n2. The facility is exclusive to the Union Government.\n3. RBI charges interest equal to the repo rate on loans given under WMA.\n\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?\n\na) 1 and 2 only\n\nb) 2 and 3 only\n\nc)\u00a0 3 only\n\nd) None of the above",

OECD has issued\u00a015 action\u00a0items\u00a0to address this.\nChallenges:\n\nIt impinges on the right of the sovereign to decide a nation\u2019s tax policy. A global minimum rate would essentially take away the ways that countries use to push policies that suit them.\n\nThe time frame for implementing the laws by 2022 so that they can take effect from 2023 is a difficult task for the countries.\n\nThe deal has also been criticized for lacking effectiveness; groups such as Oxfam said the deal would not put an end to tax havens.",

Can there be new sources other than tax revenue?\n\nYes, there are certain assets of Indian Government which can be montized. For example, Public Sector Enterprises like LIC.\n\nThe National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) estimates an aggregate monetization potential of Rs 6 lakh crores through core assets of the Central Government, over a period of four years from FY 2022 to FY 2025.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)?\nNMP as a part of Divestment Policy\nNMP vs NIP\nWhat is Monetisation?\nGreenfield Project:\nBrownfield Project:\nChallenges for implementing National Monetisation Pipeline\nWay Forward\nWhat is National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)?\n\nNITI Aayog has developed the pipeline, in consultation with infrastructure line ministries, based on the mandate for \u2018Asset Monetisation\u2019 under Union Budget 2021-22.\n\nIt\u00a0aims to unlock value in brownfield projects by engaging the private sector.\n\nThe revenue rights will be transferred to them but not ownership in the projects.

The term is used for purchasing or leasing existing production facilities to launch a new production activity.\n\nChallenges for implementing National Monetisation Pipeline\nDeficiency of identified revenue-generating ways in various assets, hence investment in them may end up in losses.\nThe slow pace of privatization in government companies including Air India and BPCL.\nThe recently launched PPP initiative in railways indicates a lack of private investors\u2019 interest.\nCapacity utilization in gas and petroleum pipeline networks is not up to the mark and has a lot of untapped potentials.\nPower sector assets come with regulated tariffs making them less viable for private players.\nNational highways below four lanes do not attract investors.\nMany assets like railways have multiple stakeholders, including state governments, which own a stake in the entity.\nWay Forward\n\nThe National Monetisation Pipeline framework on paper looks very promising, but the government should ensure proper execution to derive desired outcomes.\n\nThere is a need for an efficient dispute resolution mechanism, which is one of the key aspects of such a wide-ranged plan.\n\nThe success of the infrastructure expansion plan would depend on other stakeholders playing their due role; hence all the strata should be duly considered and be given opportunities.\n\nThe State governments and their public sector enterprises and the private sectors should be able to work together through healthy competition.\n\nA high-Powered Intergovernmental Group can be set up as recommended in the 15th finance commission to re-examine the fiscal responsibility legislation of the Centre and States.",

Read to know about the Economic Survey 2021-22 highlights.\n\nEconomic Survey is the flagship annual document of the Ministry of finance \u2013 released usually a day before the Budget for the next year is presented in the Indian Parliament.\n\nEconomic Survey gives a detailed account of the various sectors of the economy and overall economic scenario of the country in the past years and provides an outline for the year ahead.\n\nThe Economic Survey, even though a government document, provides an opportunity for the Chief Economic Adviser to provide a disinterested, economic objective analysis.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the theme of Economic Survey 2021-22?\nWhat is the Agile approach mentioned in the Economic Survey 2021?\nEconomic Survey 2021-22: Highlights\nState of the Economy\nFiscal Developments\nExternal Sectors\nMonetary Management and Financial Intermediation\nPrices and Inflation\nSustainable Development and Climate Change\nAgriculture and Food Management\nIndustry and Infrastructure\nServices\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 Summary\nWhat is the theme of Economic Survey 2021-22?\n\nThe central theme of this year\u2019s Economic Survey is the \u201cAgile approach\u201d, implemented through India\u2019s economic response to the COVID-19 Pandemic shock.\n\nAnother theme highlighted in this Economic Survey relates to the art and science of policy-making under conditions of extreme uncertainty.\n\nWhat is the Agile approach mentioned in the Economic Survey 2021?\n\nAs per the Agile approach, short-term policy responses can be tailored to an evolving situation rather than what a model may have predicted.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe short-term policy response is possible because of the explosion of real-time data that allows for constant monitoring. Such information includes GST collections, digital payments, satellite photographs, electricity production, cargo movements, internal/external trade, infrastructure roll-out, delivery of various schemes, mobility indicators etc.\n\nThe \u201cAgile approach\u201d is based on feedback loops, real-time monitoring of actual outcomes, flexible responses, safety-net buffers and so on.\n\nPlanning is not done in the Agile approach as a deterministic prediction of the flow of events. Still, planning is relevant in the framework \u2013 mostly for scenario analysis, identifying vulnerable sections, and understanding policy options.\n\nEconomic Survey 2021-22: Highlights\n\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 reverts to a single volume plus a separate volume for the Statistical Appendix.\n\nThe highlights of the Economic Survey are as follows:\n\nState of the Economy\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 estimates that the Indian economy (GDP) may grow by 9.2 per cent in real terms in 2021-22 (as per first advanced estimates) subsequent to a contraction of 7.3 per cent in 2020-21.\nGDP is projected to grow by 8- 8.5 per cent in real terms in 2022-23.\nThe year ahead is poised for a pickup in private sector investment with the financial system in a good position to provide support for the economy\u2019s revival.\nProjection is comparable with World Bank and Asian Development Bank\u2019s latest forecasts of real GDP growth of 8.7 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively for 2022-23.\nAs per IMF\u2019s latest World Economic Outlook projections, India\u2019s real GDP is projected to grow at 9 per cent in 2021-22 and 2022-23 and at 7.1 per cent in 2023-2024, which would make India the fastest-growing major economy in the world for all 3years.\nAgriculture and allied sectors are expected to grow by 3.9 per cent; industry by 11.8 per cent and services sector by 8.2 per cent in 2021-22.\nOn the demand side, consumption is estimated to grow by 7.0 per cent, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) by 15 per cent, exports by 16.5 per cent and imports by 29.4 per cent in 2021-22.\nMacroeconomic stability indicators suggest that the Indian Economy is well placed to take on the challenges of 2022-23.\nA combination of high foreign exchange reserves, sustained foreign direct investment, and rising export earnings will provide an adequate buffer against possible global liquidity tapering in 2022-23.\nThe economic impact of the \u201csecond wave\u201d was much smaller than that during the full lockdown phase in 2020-21, though the health impact was more severe.\nGovernment of India\u2019s unique response comprised of safety-nets to cushion the impact on vulnerable sections of society and the business sector, significant increase in capital expenditure to spur growth and supply-side reforms for a sustained long-term expansion.\nThe government\u2019s flexible and multi-layered response is partly based on an \u201cAgile\u201d framework that uses feedback-loops, and the use of eighty High-Frequency Indicators (HFIs) in an environment of extreme uncertainty.\nFiscal Developments\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 observes that the revenue receipts from the Central Government (April to November 2021) have gone up by 67.2 per cent (YoY) as against the expected growth of 9.6 per cent in the 2021-22 Budget Estimates (over 2020-21 Provisional Actuals).\nGross Tax Revenue registers a growth of over 50 per cent from April to November 2021 in YoY terms.\u00a0 This performance is strong compared to pre-pandemic levels of 2019-2020 also.\nDuring April-November 2021, Capex has grown by 13.5 per cent (YoY) with a focus on infrastructure-intensive sectors.\nSustained revenue collection and a targeted expenditure policy have contained the fiscal deficit for April to November 2021 at 46.2 per cent of BE.\nWith the enhanced borrowings on account of COVID-19, the Central Government debt has gone up from 49.1 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 59.3 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 but is expected to follow a declining trajectory with the recovery of the economy.\nExternal Sectors\nIndia\u2019s merchandise exports and imports rebounded strongly and surpassed pre-COVID levels during the current financial year.\nThere was a significant pickup in net services with both receipts and payments crossing the pre-pandemic levels, despite weak tourism revenues.\nNet capital flows were higher at US$ 65.6 billion in the first half of 2021-22, on account of continued inflow of foreign investment, revival in net external commercial borrowings, higher banking capital and additional special drawing rights (SDR) allocation.\nIndia\u2019s external debt rose to US $ 593.1 billion at the end-September 2021, from US $ 556.8 billion a year earlier, reflecting additional SDR allocation by IMF, coupled with higher commercial borrowings.\nForeign Exchange Reserves crossed US$ 600 billion in the first half of 2021-22 and touched US $ 633.6 billion as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of end-November 2021, India was the fourth-largest forex reserves holder in the world after China, Japan and Switzerland.\nMonetary Management and Financial Intermediation\nEconomic Survey 2021-22 notes that the liquidity in the system remained in surplus.\nRepo rate was maintained at 4 per cent in 2021-22.\nRBI undertook various measures such as G-Sec Acquisition Programme and Special Long-Term Repo Operations to provide further liquidity.\nThe economic shock of the pandemic has been weathered well by the commercial banking system:\nYoY Bank credit growth accelerated gradually in 2021-22 from 5.3 per cent in April 2021 to 9.2 per cent as of 31st\u00a0December 2021.\nThe Gross Non-Performing Advances ratio of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) declined from 11.2 per cent at the end of 2017-18 to 6.9 per cent at the end of September 2021.\nNet Non-Performing Advances ratio declined from 6 per cent to 2.2 per cent during the same period.\nThe capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of SCBs continued to increase from 13 per cent in 2013-14 to 16.54 per cent at the end of September 2021.\nThe Return on Assets and Return on Equity for Public Sector Banks continued to be positive for the period ending September 2021.\nExceptional year for the capital markets:\nRs. 89,066 crores were raised via 75 Initial Public Offering (IPO) issues in April-November 2021, which is much higher than in any year in the last decade.\nSensex and Nifty scaled up to a touching peak at 61,766 and 18,477 on October 18, 2021.\nAmong major emerging market economies, Indian markets outperformed peers in April-December 2021.\nPrices and Inflation\nThe average headline CPI-Combined inflation moderated to 5.2 per cent in 2021-22 (April-December) from 6.6 per cent in the corresponding period of 2020-21.\nThe decline in retail inflation was led by the easing of food inflation.\nFood inflation averaged at a low of 2.9 per cent in 2021-22 (April to December) as against 9.1 per cent in the corresponding period last year.\nEffective supply-side management kept prices of most essential commodities under control during the year.\nProactive measures were taken to contain the price rise in pulses and edible oils.\nReduction in central excise and subsequent cuts in Value Added Tax by most States helped ease petrol and diesel prices.\nWholesale inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) rose to 12.5 per cent during 2021-22 (April to December).\n\u00a0This has been attributed to:\nLow base in the previous year,\nPick-up in economic activity,\nA sharp increase in international prices of crude oil and other imported inputs, and\nHigh freight costs.\nThe divergence between CPI-C and WPI Inflation:\nThe divergence peaked at 9.6 percentage points in May 2020.\nHowever, this year there was a reversal in divergence with retail inflation falling below wholesale inflation by 8.0 percentage points in December 2021.\nThis divergence can be explained by factors such as:\nVariations due to base effect,\nThe difference in scope and coverage of the two indices,\nPrice collections,\nItems covered,\nThe difference in commodity weights, and\nWPI is more sensitive to cost-push inflation led by imported inputs.\nWith the gradual waning of the base effect in WPI, the divergence in CPI-C and WPI is also expected to narrow down.\nSustainable Development and Climate Change\n\nIndia\u2019s overall score on the NITI Aayog SDG India Index and Dashboard improved to 66 in 2020-21 from 60 in 2019-20 and 57 in 2018-19.\n\nThe number of Front Runners (scoring 65-99) increased to 22 States and UTs in 2020-21 from 10 in 2019-20.\n\nIn North-East India, 64 districts were Front Runners and 39 districts were Performers in the NITI Aayog North-Eastern Region District SDG Index 2021-22.\n\nIndia has the tenth largest forest area in the world.\n\nIn 2020, India ranked third globally in increasing its forest area from 2010 to 2020.\n\nIn 2020, the forests covered 24% of India\u2019s total geographical, accounting for 2% of the world\u2019s total forest area.\n\nIn August 2021, the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, was notified which is aimed at phasing out single-use plastic by 2022.\n\nDraft regulation on Extended Producer Responsibility for plastic packaging was notified.\n\nThe Compliance status of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) located in the Ganga main stem and its tributaries improved from 39% in 2017 to 81% in 2020.\n\nThe consequent reduction in effluent discharge has been from 349.13 million litres per day (MLD) in 2017 to 280.20 MLD in 2020.\n\nThe Prime Minister, as a part of the national statement delivered at the 26th\u00a0Conference of Parties (COP 26) in Glasgow in November 2021, announced ambitious targets to be achieved by 2030 to enable further reduction in emissions.\n\nThe need to start the one-word movement \u2018LIFE\u2019 (Lifestyle for Environment) urging mindful and deliberate utilization instead of mindless and destructive consumption was underlined.\n\nAgriculture and Food Management\n\nThe Agriculture sector experienced buoyant growth in the past two years, accounting for a sizeable 18.8% (2021-22) in Gross Value Added (GVA) of the country registering a growth of 3.6% in 2020-21 and 3.9% in 2021-22.\n\nMinimum Support Price (MSP) policy is being used to promote crop diversification.\n\nNet receipts from crop production have increased by 22.6% in the latest Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) compared to the SAS Report of 2014.\n\nAllied sectors including animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries are steadily emerging to be high growth sectors and major drivers of overall growth in the agriculture sector.\n\nThe Livestock sector has grown at a CAGR of 8.15% over the last five years ending 2019-20. It has been a stable source of income across groups of agricultural households accounting for about 15% of their average monthly income.\n\nGovernment facilitates food processing through various measures of infrastructure development, subsidized transportation and support for the formalization of micro food enterprises.\n\nIndia runs one of the largest food management programmes in the world.\n\nThe government has further extended the coverage of food security networks through schemes like PM Gareeb Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY).\n\nIndustry and Infrastructure\nIndex of Industrial Production (IIP) grew at 17.4 per cent (YoY) during April-November 2021 as compared to (-)15.3 per cent in April-November 2020.\nCapital expenditure for the Indian railways has increased to Rs. 155,181 crores in 2020-21 from an average annual of Rs. 45,980 crores during 2009-14 and it has been budgeted to further increase to Rs. 215,058 crores in 2021-22 \u2013 a five times increase in comparison to the 2014 level.\nThe extent of road construction per day increased substantially in 2020-21 to 36.5 Kms per day from 28 Kms per day in 2019-20 \u2013 a rise of 30.4 per cent.\nNet profit to sales ratio of large corporates reached an all-time high of 10.6 per cent in the July-September quarter of 2021-22 despite the pandemic (RBI Study).\nIntroduction of Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, the major boost provided to infrastructure-both physical as well as digital, along with measures to reduce transaction costs and improve ease of doing business, would support the pace of recovery.\nServices\nGVA of services crossed pre-pandemic level in July-September quarter of 2021-22; however, GVA of contact intensive sectors like trade, transport, etc. still remain below pre-pandemic level.\nOverall service Sector GVA is expected to grow by 8.2 per cent in 2021-22.\nDuring April-December 2021, rail freight crossed its pre-pandemic level while air freight and port traffic almost reached their pre-pandemic levels, domestic air and rail passenger traffic are increasing gradually \u2013 shows the impact of the second wave was much more muted as compared to during the first wave.\nDuring the first half of 2021-22, the service sector received over US$ 16.7 billion FDI \u2013 accounting for almost 54 per cent of total FDI inflows into India.\nIT-BPM services revenue reached US$ 194 billion in 2020-21, adding 1.38 lakh employees during the same period.\nMajor government reforms include removing telecom regulations in the IT-BPO sector and opening up of space sector to private players.\nServices exports surpassed the pre-pandemic level in the January-March quarter of 2020-21 and grew by 21.6 per cent in the first half of 2021-22 \u2013 strengthened by global demand for software and IT services exports.\nIndia has become 3rd largest start-up ecosystem in the world after US and China.

These banks are owned and controlled by the members, who democratically elect a board of directors.\nProfit Allocation: A significant part of the yearly profit, benefits, or surplus is usually allocated to constitute reserves and a part of this profit can also be distributed to the cooperative members, with legal and statutory limitations.\nFinancial Inclusion: They have played a significant role in the financial inclusion of unbanked rural masses. They provide cheap credit to the masses in rural areas.\nWhat are Urban Cooperative banks (UCB)?\n\nThe term Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) is not formally defined but refers to primary cooperative banks located in urban and semi-urban areas.\n\nThe Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), the Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), and Local Area Banks (LABs) could be considered as differentiated banks as they operate in localized areas.\n\nTill 1996, these banks were allowed to lend money only for non-agricultural purposes. This distinction does not hold today.\n\nThese banks were traditionally centred on communities and local workgroups as they essentially lent to small borrowers and businesses. Today, their scope of operations has widened considerably.\n\nHistory of Urban Cooperative Banks\n\nThe inspiration for UCB was the success of the experiments related to the cooperative movement in Britain and the cooperative credit movement in Germany. The origins of the urban cooperative banking movement in India can be traced back to the 19th century when such societies were first set up in India.\n\nCooperative societies are based on the principles of cooperation, mutual help, democratic decision-making, and open membership. Cooperatives represented a new and alternative approach to organization as against proprietary firms, partnership firms, and joint-stock companies which represent the dominant form of commercial organization.\n\nThe first known mutual aid society in India was the \u2018Anyonya Sahakari Mandali\u2019 organized in the erstwhile princely State of Baroda in 1889 under the guidance of Vithal Laxman also known as Bhausaheb Kavthekar.\n\nThe enactment of the Cooperative Credit Societies Act, 1904 gave the real impetus to the movement. The first urban cooperative credit society was registered in Canjeevaram (Kanjivaram) in the erstwhile Madras province in October 1904.\n\nThe most prominent amongst the early credit societies was the Bombay Urban Co-operative Credit Society, sponsored by Vithaldas Thackersey and Lallubhai Samaldas established on January 23, 1906.\n\nThe Maclagan Committee of 1915 was appointed to review their performance and suggest measures for strengthening them. The committee observed that such institutions were suited to cater to the needs of the lower and middle-income classes of society and would encourage the principles of banking amongst the middle classes.\n\nThe Government of India Act in 1919 transferred the subject of \u201cCooperation\u201d from the Government of India to the Provincial Governments.\n\nThe Cooperative Planning Committee (1946) and The Rural Banking Enquiry Committee (1950) recommended the establishment of such banks even in places smaller than taluka towns.\n\nThe first study of Urban Cooperative Banks was taken up by RBI in 1958-59. The Report published in 1961 acknowledged the widespread and financially sound framework of urban cooperative banks and emphasized the need to establish primary urban cooperative banks in new centers and suggested that State Governments lend active support to their development.\n\nRecent developments related to UCB\n\nIn January 2020, the RBI\u00a0revised the Supervisory action Framework (SAF) for UCBs.\n\nIn June 2020, the Central government approved an Ordinance to bring all urban and multi-state cooperative banks under the direct supervision of RBI.\n\nMost recently RBI appointed a committee that suggested 4 tier structure for the UCBs.\n\nTier 1 with all unit UCBs and salary earner\u2019s UCBs (irrespective of deposit size) and all other UCBs having deposits up to Rs 100 crore,\nTier 2 with UCBs of deposits between Rs 100 crore and Rs 1,000 crore,\nTier 3 with UCBs of deposits between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore and\nTier 4 with UCBs of deposits more than Rs 10,000 crore.\nChallenges faced by cooperative banks:\n1. Changing financial sector trends:\n\nChanges in the financial sector and evolving microfinance, FinTech companies, payment gateways, social platforms, e-commerce companies, and NBFCs challenge the continued presence of the UCBs, which are mostly small in size, lack professional management, and have geographically less diversified operations.\n\n2. The decline in deposits and loans:\n\nThe collapses in the management have led to people losing trust in cooperative banks slowly.\n\n3. Declining contributions:\n\nA report noted that despite a crucial role played by the sector, its share in total agricultural lending diminished considerably over the years from as high as 64% in 1992-93 to just 11.3 % in 2019-20.\n\n4. Declining numbers:\n\nAfter liberalization in licensing policy of 1993, nearly one-third of the newly licensed ones became financially unsound. In 2005, RBI merged the weaker ones together into one unit.\n\n5. Dual control:\n\nThe UCBs were under dual regulation by the state registrar of societies and the RBI. But in 2020, all UCBs and multi-state cooperatives were brought under the supervision of RBI.\n\nWay forward:\n\nThe establishment of the country\u2019s dedicated Ministry of Cooperation is a crucial moment for the history of the cooperative movement.\n\nNow, the establishment of a standard regulatory and supervisory framework, and an umbrella organization, should be given top importance in the advancement of UCBs.\n\nThe RBI is should interpret the Act\u2019s provisions so that they do not disrupt UCBs and people\u2019s faith is restored in the cooperative banking system.",

They are (1) Land (2) Labour (3) Physical Capital and (4) Human Capital.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEvery production is organised by combining land, labour, physical capital and human capital, which are known as factors of production.\n\n1. Land (Natural Resources)\n\nThe first factor of production is land.\n\nHowever, in economics, by land, we mean all that is given to us free by nature.\n\nThis includes not just land, but anything that comes from the land.\n\nMost of the natural resources like soil, water, forests, minerals, petroleum, sunlight, wind etc come under the category of land \u2013 the first factor of production.\n\nNote: The income that the owners of the land earn in return for land resources is called rent.\n\n2. Labour (Human Resources)\n\nWhile natural resources are one factor of production, human resources are another.\n\nThe second factor of production\u00a0 \u2013 Labour \u2013 includes all efforts of human beings used for the production of goods and services. Labour include physical and mental labour.\n\nNote: The income earned by labour resources is called wages.\n\n3. Physical Capital (Man-made Resources)\n\nCapital includes all the man-made resources used for producing goods and services like buildings, machines, equipment, vehicles, stock of materials etc.\n\nCapital denotes all tools humans use to produce goods and services. For example, a stethoscope is the capital of a doctor.\n\nPhysical capital can be broadly divided into two categories \u2013 Fixed Capital and Working Capital.\n\nTools, machines, buildings etc that can be used in production over many years are called fixed capital.\n\nRaw materials and money in hand are called working capital. Unlike tools, machines and buildings, these are used up in production.\n\nYou should note here that some economists do not consider money in hand as capital. This is because money merely facilitates trade, but it is not in itself a productive resource. Only if it is a productive resource, it can be considered as capital (fixed capital). It is not money but the capital goods such as machinery and tools bought by the money that are used to produce goods and services.\n\nNote: The income earned by owners of capital resources is interest.\n\n4. Human Capital (Entrepreneurship OR Entrepreneur OR Enterprise)\n\nOnly those with knowledge and entrepreneurial skills will be able to put together land, labour and physical capital and produce an output.\n\nThus the fourth factor of production is entrepreneurship. These days, entrepreneurship (the knowledge and skillset) is also known as Human Capital.\n\nUnless somebody takes an initiative, no business can be started. The one who takes this initiative is termed an entrepreneur.\n\nAn entrepreneur is a person who combines the other factors of production \u2013 land, labour, and capital \u2013 to earn a profit.\n\nThink of the entrepreneurship of Bill Gates, Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos.\n\nNote: The income accruing to the entrepreneur is termed as profit.\n\nIncome Types: Factor Income and Non-Factor Income\n\nWhat is the meaning of income?\n\nWhat are the types of income?\n\nWe have so far seen that people receive different types of incomes \u2013 rent, wages, interest, and profit.\n\nWe also receive gifts and donations from others without giving anything in return.\n\nAll these incomes can be grouped into two types of incomes \u2013 Factor incomes and Non-factor incomes\n\nFactor Income\n\nA factor income is an income accruing to a factor of production in return for the services rendered to the production unit.\n\nFor example for the services rendered, land receives rent, labour receives wages, capital receives interest, and entrepreneur receives profit.\n\nNon- factor income\n\nThere are certain money receipts that do not involve any sacrifice on the part of their recipients. They are not earned by playing a role as a factor of production \u2013 hence this income has no connection with the production of any goods and services. Such incomes are known as non-factor income.\n\nExamples include\u00a0gifts, donation charities, taxes, fines etc.\n\nNo production activity is involved in getting these incomes.\n\nThese incomes are also called transfer incomes because such income merely represents the transfer of money without any good or service being provided in return for the receipts.\n\nThese incomes are not included in national income.\n\nWhy is it not easy to produce more goods and services?\n\nLet\u2019s try to find the answer to the question we raised at the beginning.\n\nWe have now learned that if we produce more goods and services we earn more income. It can be either as rent, wages, interest, or profit.\n\nThe more income a country generates, the richer it will become.\n\nThen, why nations are not able to increase production? Why is it not easy to increase Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?\n\nIt is not easy to produce more goods are services because factors of production are limited in nature.\n\nYes, goods and services are scarce because the four factors of production (land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship) are scarce.\n\nOnce we realise this concept, it is easy to understand most of the economic principles.\n\nEconomics is the study of how society allocates these scarce resources (land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship) to produce output (goods and services).\n\nThe scarce resources \u2013 four factors of production \u2013 land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship \u2013 form the building blocks of any economy."
