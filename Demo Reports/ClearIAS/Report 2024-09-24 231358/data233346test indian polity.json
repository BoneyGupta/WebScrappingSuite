(Satyendra Prasanna Sinha, as the law member)\nGovernment of India Act of 1919\nThis Act is also known as the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms.\nThe Central subjects were demarcated and\u00a0separated from those of the Provincial subjects.\nThe scheme of dual governance, \u2018Dyarchy\u2019, was\u00a0introduced in the Provincial subjects.\nUnder the dyarchy system, the provincial subjects were divided into two parts \u2013 transferred and reserved. On reserved subjects, the Governor was not responsible to the Legislative council.\nThe Act introduced, for the first time,\u00a0bicameralism at the center.\nLegislative Assembly with 140 members and Legislative Council with 60 members.\nDirect elections.\nThe Act also required that three of the six members of the Viceroy\u2019s Executive Council (other than Commander-in-Chief) were to be Indians.\nProvided for the establishment of the Public Service Commission.\nGovernment of India Act of 1935\nThe GoI Act of 1935 provided for the establishment of an All-India Federation consisting of the Provinces and the Princely States as units, though the envisaged federation never came into being.\nThree Lists: The Act divided the powers between the Centre and the units into items of three lists, namely the Federal List, the Provincial List, and the Concurrent List.\nThe Federal List for the Centre consisted of\u00a059 items, the Provincial List for the provinces\u00a0consisted of 54 items and the Concurrent List\u00a0for both consisted of 36 items\nThe residuary powers were vested with the\u00a0Governor-General.\nThe Act abolished the Dyarchy in the Provinces\u00a0and introduced \u2018Provincial Autonomy\u2019.\nIt provided for the adoption of Dyarchy at the\u00a0Centre.\nIntroduced bicameralism in 6 out of 11\u00a0Provinces.\nThese six Provinces were Assam, Bengal, Bombay, Bihar, Madras, and the United Province.\nProvided for the establishment of the Federal Court.\nAbolished the Council of India.\nIndian Independence Act of 1947\nIt declared India as an Independent and\u00a0Sovereign State.\nEstablished responsible Governments at both\u00a0the Centre and the Provinces.\nDesignated the Viceroy\u00a0India and\u00a0the provincial Governors as the Constitutional\u00a0(normal heads).\nIt assigned dual functions (Constituent and\u00a0Legislative) to the Constituent Assembly and\u00a0declared this dominion legislature as a\u00a0sovereign body.\nPoints to be noted\n\nLaws made before the Charter Act of 1833 were called Regulations and those made after\u00a0are called Acts.\nLord Warren Hastings created the office of District Collector in 1772, but judicial powers were separated from District Collector later by Cornwallis.\nFrom the powerful authorities of unchecked executives, the Indian administration developed into a responsible government answerable to the legislature and people.\nThe development of the portfolio system and budget points to the separation of power.\nLord Mayo\u2019s resolution on financial decentralization visualized the development of local self-government institutions in India (1870).\n1882: Lord Ripon\u2019s resolution was hailed as the \u2018Magna Carta\u2019 of local self-government. He is regarded as the \u2018Father of local self-government in India\u2019.\n1924: The Railway Budget was separated from the General Budget based on the Acworth Committee report (1921).\nFrom 1773 to 1858, the British tried for the centralization of power. It was from the 1861 Councils act they shifted towards devolution of power with provinces.\n1833 Charter Act was the most important act before the Act of 1909.\nTill 1947, the Government of India functioned under the provisions of the 1919 Act only. The provisions of the 1935 Act relating to Federation and Dyarchy were never implemented.\nThe Executive Council provided by the 1919 Act\u00a0continued to advise the Viceroy\u00a0till\u00a01947. The modern executive (Council of Ministers) owes its legacy to the executive council.\nThe Legislative Council and Assembly developed into Rajyasabha and Loksabha after independence.\n\nRead: Indian Constitution: History and Evolution"

The preamble gives an idea about the following: (1) the source of the constitution, (2) the nature of the Indian state (3) a statement of its objectives and (4) the date of its adoption.\n\nWE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:\n\nJUSTICE, social, economic and political;\n\nLIBERTY\u00a0of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;\n\nEQUALITY\u00a0of status and of opportunity;\n\nand to promote among them all\n\nFRATERNITY\u00a0assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;\n\nIN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, DO HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.\n\nSource of the Constitution\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nWe, the people of India.\n\nThe phrase \u201cWe the people of India\u201d emphasises that the constitution is made by and for the Indian people and not given to them by any outside power.\n\nIt also\u00a0emphasizes the concept of popular sovereignty as laid down by Rousseau: All the power emanates from the people and the political system will be accountable and responsible to the people.\n\nNature of Indian state\nSovereign: India is internally and externally sovereign \u2013 externally free from the control of any foreign power and internally, it has a free government that is directly elected by the people and makes laws that govern the people. No external power can dictate the government of India.\nSocialist: \u201cSocialism\u201d is an economic philosophy where means of production and distribution are owned by the State. India adopted Mixed Economy, where apart from the state, there will be private production too. Socialism as a social philosophy stresses more on societal equality.\nSecular:\u00a0Features of secularism as envisaged in the Preamble is to mean that the state will have no religion of its own and all persons will be equally entitled to the freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate the religion of their choice. (S R Bommai and Others v Union of India, AIR 1994 SC 1918)\nDemocratic: Indicates that the Constitution has established a form of government that gets its authority from the will of the people. The rulers are elected by the people and are responsible to them.\nRepublic:\u00a0As opposed to a\u00a0monarchy, in which the head of state is appointed on the hereditary basis for a lifetime or until he abdicates from the throne, a democratic\u00a0republic\u00a0is an entity in which the head of state is elected, directly or indirectly, for a fixed tenure. The\u00a0President of India\u00a0is elected by an electoral college for a term of five years. The post of the President Of India is not hereditary. Every citizen of India is eligible to become the President of the country.\nObjectives of Indian State\nJustice: Social, Economic and Political.\nEquality: of status and opportunity.\nLiberty: of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship\nFraternity (=Brotherhood): assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation.\nDate of its adoption\n\nThe date of adoption of the Constitution is 26th November 1949. \u00a0But most of the articles in the Constitution came into force on January 26th, 1950. Those articles which came into existence on 26th November 1949 is given by Article 394.\n\nArticle 394 states that this article (394) and articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 60, 324, 366, 367, 379, 380, 388, 391, 392 and 393 shall come into force at once, and the remaining provisions of this Constitution shall come into force on the twenty-sixth day of January 1950, which day is referred to in this Constitution as the commencement of this Constitution.\n\n26 January was selected for this purpose because it was this day in 1930 when the Declaration of Indian Independence (Purna Swaraj) was proclaimed by the Indian National Congress.\n\nInfo Bits related to\u00a0Preamble of Indian Constitution\nWho was the Calligrapher of the Indian Constitution: Prem Behari Narain Raizada (1901\u20131966) was the calligrapher who hand-wrote the Constitution of India.\nWho was the chief artist behind the illustration of the original Indian Constitution: Nandalal Bose took up the historic task of beautifying/decorating the original manuscript of the Constitution of India. He was assisted by his disciple Beohar Rammanohar Sinha.\nWho designed and decorated the Preamble page of the Indian Constitution: The preamble page, along with other pages of the original Constitution of India, was designed and decorated solely by renowned painter Beohar Rammanohar Sinha\u00a0of\u00a0Jabalpur.\nSupreme Court of India\u00a0has, in the\u00a0Kesavananda case, recognised that the preamble may be used to interpret ambiguous areas of the constitution where differing interpretations present themselves. (In the 1995 case of Union Government Vs LIC of India also the Supreme Court has once again held that Preamble is an integral part of the Constitution.\nAs originally enacted the preamble described the state as a \u201csovereign\u00a0democratic\u00a0republic\u201d. In 1976 the\u00a0Forty-second Amendment\u00a0changed this by adding words socialist and secular to read \u201csovereign\u00a0socialist\u00a0secular\u00a0democratic republic\u201d."

The Citizenship Act of 1955 governs matters related to Indian citizenship. The act defines various ways through which a person can acquire or lose Indian citizenship.\n\nThere are three main ways through which individuals can acquire Indian citizenship:\n\nBy Birth:\n\nIndividuals born in India on or after January 26, 1950, are considered citizens of India by birth.\nIndividuals born in India between January 26, 1950, and July 1, 1987, are considered citizens regardless of the nationality of their parents.\nIndividuals born in India on or after July 1, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, are considered citizens if at least one parent is a citizen of India at the time of their birth.\n\nBy Descent\n\nIndividuals born outside India on or after January 26, 1950, but before December 10, 1992, are considered citizens if their father is a citizen of India at the time of their birth.\nIndividuals born outside India on or after December 10, 1992, are considered citizens if either of their parents is a citizen of India at the time of their birth.\n\nBy Registration\n\nIndividuals who are not citizens by birth or descent can acquire Indian citizenship through registration under certain conditions. This includes people who have been residing in India for several years or are married to Indian citizens.\n\nThe Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2003 introduced provisions for Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO), allowing certain categories of foreign nationals of Indian origin to have certain privileges and rights in India without full citizenship.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the acquisition of Indian citizenship can also lead to the loss of citizenship in some cases. For example, a person who voluntarily acquires the citizenship of another country may lose their Indian citizenship. Additionally, the government of India has the authority to cancel or revoke citizenship under specific circumstances.\n\nCitizenship: Part II of Constituion\n\nPart II of the Constitution of India (Articles 5-11) deals with the Citizenship of India.\n\nArticle 5 speaks about the citizenship of India at the commencement of the Constitution (Nov 26, 1949). Article 11 gave powers to the Parliament of India to regulate the right of citizenship by law. This provision resulted in the enactment of the Citizenship Act 1955 by the Indian Parliament.\n\nArticle 5: Citizenship at the Commencement of the Constitution\n\nAt the commencement of this Constitution, every person who has his domicile in the territory of India and \u2013\n\n(a) who was born in the territory of India; or\n\n(b) either of whose parents were born in the territory of India; or\n\n(c) who has been ordinarily resident in the territory of India for not less than five years immediately preceding such commencement, shall be a citizen of India.\n\nArticle 6: Rights of citizenship of certain persons who have migrated to India from Pakistan\n\nNotwithstanding anything in Article 5, a person who has migrated to the territory of India from the territory now included in Pakistan shall be deemed to be a citizen of India at the commencement of this Constitution if \u2013\n\n(a) he or either of his parents or any of his grand-parents was born in India as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935 (as originally enacted); and\n\n(b) (i) In the case where such a person has so migrated before the nineteenth day of July 1948, he has been ordinarily resident in the territory of India since the date of his migration, or\n\n(ii) in the case where such a person has so migrated on or after the nineteenth day of July 1948, he has been registered as a citizen of India by an officer appointed on that behalf by the Government of the Dominion of India on an application made by him therefor to such officer before the commencement of this Constitution in the form and manner prescribed by that Government:\n\nProvided that no person shall be so registered unless he has been resident in the territory of India for at least six months immediately preceding the date of his application.\nArticle 7: Rights of citizenship of certain migrants to Pakistan\n\nNotwithstanding anything in articles 5 and 6, a person who has after the first day of March 1947, migrated from the territory of India to the territory now included in Pakistan shall not be deemed to be a citizen of India:\n\nProvided that nothing in this article shall apply to a person who, after having so migrated to the territory now included in Pakistan, has returned to the territory of India under a permit for resettlement or permanent return issued by or under the authority of any law and every such person shall for clause (b) of Article 6 be deemed to have migrated to the territory of India after the nineteenth day of July 1948.\n\nArticle 8: Rights of citizenship of certain persons of Indian origin residing outside India\n\nNotwithstanding anything in Article 5, any person who or either of whose parents or any of whose grandparents was born in India as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935 (as originally enacted), and who is ordinarily residing in any country outside India as so defined shall be deemed to be a citizen of India if he has been registered as a citizen of India by the diplomatic or consular representative of India in the country where he is for the time being residing on an application made by him therefor to such diplomatic or consular representative, whether before or after the commencement of this Constitution, in the form and manner prescribed by the Government of the Dominion of India or the Government of India.\n\nArticle 9: Persons voluntarily acquiring citizenship of a foreign State not to be citizens\n\nNo person shall be a citizen of India by Article 5 or be deemed to be a citizen of India by Article 6 or Article 8 if he has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of any foreign State.\n\nArticle 10: Continuance of the rights of citizenship\n\nEvery person who is or is deemed to be a citizen of India under any of the foregoing provisions of this Part shall, subject to the provisions of any law that may be made by Parliament, continue to be such citizen.\n\nArticle 11: Parliament to regulate the right of citizenship by law\n\nNothing in the foregoing provisions of this Part shall derogate from the power of Parliament to make any provision concerning the acquisition and termination of citizenship and all other matters relating to citizenship.\n\nInfo-bits related to the Citizenship of India\nThe conferment of a person, as a citizen of India, is governed by Articles 5 to 11 (Part II) of the Indian Constitution.\nApart from the above Articles of the Indian Constitution, citizenship is also deeply connected with the Citizenship Act, which is passed by the Indian Parliament in 1955.\nCitizenship Act 1955 speaks about the citizenship of India after the commencement of the Constitution. It is an act to provide for the acquisition and termination of Indian citizenship.\nThe legislation related to this matter is the Citizenship Act 1955, which has been amended by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1986, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1992, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2005, and the Citizenship (Amendment Act, 2019).\nAcquisition of Indian Citizenship as per Citizenship Act 1955: Indian Citizenship can be acquired in the following ways : (1) Citizenship at the commencement of the constitution of India (2) Citizenship by birth: NB \u2013 This provision has different clauses for different periods (3) Citizenship by descent (4) Citizenship by registration (5) Citizenship by naturalization.\nTermination\u00a0of Indian Citizenship as per Citizenship Act 1955:\u00a0One can lose citizenship of India in three ways \u2013 Renunciation, Termination, and Deprivation\nPersons domiciled in the territory of India as on 26 November 1949 automatically became Indian citizens by the operation of the relevant provisions of the Indian Constitution coming into force. (Citizenship at the commencement of the constitution of India.)\nAny person born in India on or after 26 January 1950, but before the commencement of the 1986 Act on 1 July 1987, is a citizen of India by birth. \u00a0[Citizenship by birth]\nA person born in India on or after 1 July 1987 is a citizen of India if either parent was a citizen of India at the time of the birth.\u00a0[Citizenship by birth]\nThose born in India on or after 3 December 2004 are considered citizens of India only if both of their parents are citizens of India or if one parent is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of their birth.\u00a0[Citizenship by birth].\nIndian nationality law\u00a0largely follows the\u00a0jus sanguinis\u00a0(citizenship by right of blood) as opposed to the\u00a0jus soli\u00a0(citizenship by right of birth within the territory).\nArticle 9 of the Indian Constitution says that a person who voluntarily acquires citizenship of any other country is no longer an Indian citizen. Also, according to The Passports Act, a person has to surrender his Indian passport if he acquires citizenship of another country, it is a punishable offense under the act if he fails to surrender the passport.\nPersons of Indian Origin (PIO) Card: A PIO card applicant has to be a person of Indian origin who is a citizen of any country, other than Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Afghanistan, China, and Nepal; or a person who has held an Indian passport at any time or is the spouse of an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin;\nOverseas Citizen of India (OCI) card: OCI Card is for foreign nationals who were eligible to become a citizen of India on 26.01.1950 or was a citizen of India on or after that date.\u00a0Applications from citizens of Bangladesh and Pakistan are not allowed.\nOverseas Indian Card: A new Bill is pending in Parliament [The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill], which seeks to do away with the existing overseas citizen of India (OCI) card and the person of Indian origin (PIO) card, and replace them with a new overseas Indian card.\nWhile PIO cardholders do not require a separate visa and can enter India with multiple entry facilities for 15 years; the OCI card is multiple entries, multi-purpose lifelong visa for visiting India. OCI cardholders have parity with non-resident Indians in respect of economic, financial, and educational matters except in acquiring agricultural land.\nA PIO cardholder is required to register with local Police authorities for any stay exceeding 180 days in India on any single visit.\nOCI is not dual citizenship. There are no voting rights for an OCI cardholder.\nThe\u00a0President of India\u00a0is termed the first Citizen of India."

            "[CONTENT]": "Directive Principles of State Policy are a set of guidelines or principles enshrined in Part IV (Articles 36 to 51) of the Constitution of India. Unlike fundamental rights, which are justiciable and can be enforced by the courts, Directive Principles are non-justiciable. This means that they are not legally enforceable by the courts, but they serve as important guidelines for the government in formulating policies and laws. Read here to know them in detail.\n\nPart IV of the Indian Constitution deals with the Directive Principles of our State Policy (DPSP).\n\nThe provisions contained in this Part cannot be enforced by any court, but these principles are fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws.\n\nThe concept of Directive Principles of State Policy was borrowed from the Irish Constitution.

They provide a framework for the government to strive towards achieving certain socio-economic goals, even though they may not be immediately attainable due to various constraints.\n\nWhile the Directive Principles themselves are not legally enforceable, they are considered fundamental in the governance of the country.\nThey guide the formulation of policies and laws by the government and are taken into consideration by the legislature while enacting laws.\nOver the years, many judicial decisions and legislative measures have been influenced by the spirit of the Directive Principles.\nThe balance between fundamental rights and Directive Principles is essential for creating a just and equitable society that respects individual freedoms while striving for the welfare of all citizens.\n\nSome of the key principles outlined in the DPSP include:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025:

However, like the Directive Principles, these are non-justifiable, without any legal sanction in case of their violation or non-compliance.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nArticle 51A: Fundamental duties\nInfo-bits related to Fundamental Duties\nArticle 51A: Fundamental duties\n\nIt shall be the duty of every citizen of India \u2013\n\n(a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag, and the National Anthem;\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n(b) to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom;\n\n(c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India;\n\n(d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so;\n\n(e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic, and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women;\n\n(f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;\n\n(g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures;\n(h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism, and the spirit of inquiry and reform;\n\n(i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence;\n\n(j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavor and achievement.\n\n(k) to provide opportunities for education by the parent the guardian, to his child, or a ward between the age of 6-14 years as the case may be.\n\nAlso read: Fundamental Rights Available Only to Citizens of India\n\nInfo-bits related to Fundamental Duties\n\nThe Fundamental Duties of citizens were added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, upon the recommendations of the\u00a0Swaran Singh\u00a0Committee that was constituted by the government earlier that year.\nFundamental duties apply only to citizens and not to aliens.\nIndia borrowed the concept of Fundamental Duties from the USSR.\nThe inclusion of Fundamental Duties brought our Constitution in line with Article 29 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with provisions in several modern Constitutions of other countries.\nOut of the ten clauses in Article 51A, six are positive duties and the other five are negative duties. Clauses (b), (d), (f), (h), (j), and (k) require the citizens to perform these Fundamental Duties actively.\nIt is suggested that a few more Fundamental Duties, namely, the duty to vote in an election, the duty to pay taxes, and the duty to resist injustice may be added in due course to article 51A in Part IVA of the Constitution. (NATIONAL COMMISSION TO REVIEW THE WORKING OF THE CONSTITUTION: A Consultation Paper on EFFECTUATION OF FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES OF CITIZENS).\n\u00a0It is no longer correct to say that Fundamental Duties enshrined in Article 51A are not enforceable to ensure their implementation and are a mere reminder.\u00a0\u00a0Fundamental Duties have the element of compulsion regarding compliance.\n\u00a0Several judicial decisions are available for the enforcement of certain clauses under Article 51A.\nComprehensive legislation is needed for clauses (a), (c), (e), (g), and (i). The remaining 5 clauses, which are exhortations of basic human values, have to be developed amongst citizens through the education system by creating proper and graded curricular input from the primary level of education to the higher and professional levels.\n\u00a0Available Legal Provisions: Justice Varma Committee was constituted in 1998 \u201cto work out a strategy as well as the methodology of operationalizing a countrywide program for teaching fundamental Duties in every educational institution as a measure of in-service training\u201d. The Verma Committee was conscious of the fact that any non-operationalization of Fundamental Duties might not necessarily be the lack of concern or non-availability of legal and other enforceable provisions, but it was more a case of lacuna in the strategy of implementation.\u00a0\u00a0It, therefore, thought it appropriate to list in brief some of the legal provisions already available regarding the enforcement of Fundamental Duties.\n\nAlso read: Fundamental Duties As Per Indian Constitution\n\nA summary of such legal provisions is given below:\n\nTo ensure that no disrespect is shown to the National Flag, the Constitution of India, and the National anthem, the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, of 1971 was enacted.\nThe Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act 1950 was enacted soon after independence,\u00a0inter alia, to prevent improper use of the National Flag and the National Anthem.\nTo ensure that the correct usage regarding the display of the National Flag is well understood, the instructions issued from time to time on the subject have been embodied in the Flag Code of India, which has been made available to all the State Governments, and Union territory Administration (UT).\nThere are several provisions in the existing criminal laws to ensure that the activities which encourage enmity between different groups of people on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc. are adequately punished.\u00a0\u00a0Writings, speeches, gestures, activities, exercises, drills, etc. aimed at creating a feeling of insecurity or ill-will among the members of other communities, etc. have been prohibited under Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nImputations and assertions that are prejudicial to national integration constitute a punishable offense under Section 153 B of the IPC.\nA Communal organization can be declared unlawful association under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967.\nOffenses related to religion are covered in Sections 295-298 of the IPC (Chapter XV).\nProvisions of the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 (earlier the Untouchability (Offences) Act 1955).\n\u00a0Sections 123(3) and 123(3A) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 declares that soliciting of vote on the ground of religion and the promotion or attempt to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens of India on the grounds of religion, race, caste, community or language is a corrupt practice.\u00a0\u00a0A person indulging in a corrupt practice can be disqualified from being a Member of Parliament or a State Legislature under Section 8A of the Representation of People Act, 1951."

upon his office.\n\n\u00a0Info-Bits Related to the President of India\n\nThe salary of the Indian President is Rs.5 lakh. Until 2017, the President used to get Rs 1.50 lakh per month. In Budget 2018, it was increased to Rs 5 lakh per month.\nIn addition to the salary, the President receives many other allowances and free facilities which include free medical, housing, and treatment facilities (whole life).\nThe Government of India spends around Rs.2.25 crore rupees annually on other expenses like the President\u2019s housing, staff, food, and hosting of guests.\nIndian President\u2019s salary is 7000$x12=84,000$, which is much lower when compared to the US President\u2019s salary of 4,00,000$.\nThe president of the United States of America is also indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College but to a four-year term. He is one of only two nationally elected federal officers, the other being the Vice President of the United States. (In total, there are 538 electors, corresponding to the 435 members of the House of Representatives, 100 senators, and the three additional electors from the District of Columbia.)\nUnder The Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, of 1952, a candidate, to be nominated for the office of president of India needs 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders for his or her name to appear on the ballot.\nThe general principle in the Indian Presidential election is that the total number of votes cast by Members of Parliament equals the total number of votes cast by State Legislators.\nThere are a total of 776 voters in both Houses of Parliament. The Electoral College also consisted of 4120 MLAs in the states.\nThe formula to determine the value of the vote of an MLA =\u00a0Population of the state\u00a0\u00f7 (No. of M.L.A.s in the state X 1000).\nThe formula to determine the value of the vote of an MP =\u00a0Total value votes assigned to all the M.L.A.s\u00a0\u00f7\u00a0Total number of MPs.\nEach MP had a vote value of 708 in the Presidential Election of 2012.\nLegislators from larger states cast more votes than those from smaller states.\nIf a state has few legislators, then each legislator has more votes; if a state has many legislators, then each legislator has fewer votes.\nJFYI: The President of India moves around in a custom built heavily armored Mercedes Benz S600 Pullman Guard (which costs around Rs. 12 Crore).\nNominated members cannot vote in the Presidential election. But they can participate in President\u2019s impeachment.\nPS: Nominated members can participate in Vice-President\u2019s election and removal.\nMLAs are involved in the Presidential election, but they have no role in President\u2019s impeachment. President\u2019s impeachment resolution requires a special majority of both houses of the parliament to pass.\nPowers of the President of India\n\nThe powers of the Indian President can be broadly classified under 8 headings. They are :\n\nLegislative\nExecutive or Appointment powers\nJudicial powers\nFinancial powers\nDiplomatic powers\nMilitary powers\nPardoning Powers\nEmergency powers\n\nThere are articles outside Chapter 1 of Part V relating to the powers of the President of India like Article 72 and Articles 352-360. We shall discuss in detail each of them later.\n\nArticle 72: Power of President to grant pardons, etc., and to suspend, remit, or commute sentences in certain cases\n\n(1) The President shall have the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any persons convicted of any offense \u2013 (a) in all cases where the punishment or sentence is by a Court Martial;\n(b) in all cases where the punishment or sentence is for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends;\n(c) in all cases where the sentence is a sentence of death.\n(2) Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the power conferred by law on any officer of the Armed Forces of the Union to suspend, remit or commute a sentence passed by a Court-martial.\n(3) Nothing in sub-clause (c) of clause (1) shall affect the power to suspend, remit or commute a sentence of death exercisable by the Governor of a State under any law for the time being in force."

Constitution.\n\nInfo-Bits related to the Vice-President of India\n\nThe office of the Vice-President of India is special because of multiple reasons. It would be interesting to explore the constitutional provisions related to the VP of India. Try, if you can find the answers to the following questions, yourself.\n\nCan the Vice-President of India continue to be in office irrespective of the expiry of his term of 5 years?\nWho performs the duties of the Vice-President, when a vacancy occurs in the office of the Vice-President of India, before the expiry of his term?\nWho performs the duties of the Vice-President, when a vacancy occurs in the office of the Vice-President of India when the Vice-President acts as the President of India?\nWho performs the Vice-President\u2019s function as the Chairperson of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha)\u00a0when a vacancy occurs in the office of the Vice-President of India?\nSalary for Vice-President for his role as Vice-President of India?\nSalary for Vice-President for his role as\u00a0ex-officio Chairperson of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha)?\nSalary for Vice-President when Vice-President acts as President of India?\nCan nominate members to participate in the election and removal process of the Vice President?\nVice-President is neither an elected nor nominated member of the Rajya Sabha. But being the chairman of Rajya Sabha, can he cast a vote?\nHow can the Vice-President of India remove from his office?\n\nAnswers:\n\nCan the Vice-President of India continue to be in office irrespective of the expiry of his term of 5 years? Ans: Yes. Until the successor assumes office.\nWho performs the duties of the Vice-President, when a vacancy occurs in the office of the Vice-President of India, before the expiry of his term? Ans: The Constitution is silent on this matter.\nWho performs the duties of the Vice-President, when a vacancy occurs in the office of the Vice-President of India when the Vice-President acts as the President of India? Ans: The Constitution is silent on this matter.\nWho performs the Vice-President\u2019s function as the Chairperson of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha)\u00a0when a vacancy occurs in the office of the Vice-President of India? Ans: Deputy Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, or any other member of the Rajya Sabha authorized by the President of India.\nSalary for Vice-President for his role as Vice-President of India? Ans: No salary for the role of Vice-President. Salary is for the role of ex-officio Chairperson of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha).\nSalary for Vice-President for his role as\u00a0ex-officio Chairperson of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha)? Ans: Rs.1.25 lakhs.\nSalary for Vice-President when Vice-President acts as President of India? Ans: He will get the salary of the Indian President, ie Rs.1.5 lakh. But he will stop getting the salary of the ex-officio chairman of Rajya Sabha.\nCan nominate members to participate in the election and removal process of the Vice President? Ans: Yes. (NB: For the Presidential election nominated members cannot participate.)\nVice-President is neither an elected nor nominated member of the Rajya Sabha. But being the chairman of Rajya Sabha, can he cast a vote? Ans: Yes. The Chairman has a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes.\nHow can the Vice-President of India remove from his office? Ans: Vice-President may be removed from his office by a resolution of the Council of States passed by a majority of all the then members of the Council and agreed to by the House of the People, but no resolution for this clause shall be moved unless at least fourteen days\u2019 notice has been given of the intention to move the resolution.\nRemoval of Vice-President of India\n\nAspirants are requested to note a mistake that you might find in many textbooks on Indian Polity, under the topic \u2018Removal of the Vice-President of India\u2019. I have seen textbooks mentioning that the removal of Vice-President needs an absolute majority (half of the total strength of the house). But this cannot be right.\n\nLet\u2019s check once again what is mentioned in Constitution, Article 67(b).\n\nA Vice-President may be removed from his office by a resolution of the Council of States passed by a majority of all the then members of the Council and agreed to by the House of the People; but no resolution for the purpose of this clause shall be moved unless at least fourteen days\u2019 notice has been given of the intention to move the resolution.\n\nLet\u2019s see what is the importance of the word \u201cthen\u201d here. Suppose the present strength of the Rajya Sabha is 245 seats. And if 45 seats are vacant, then the strength of the house gets reduced to 200. So a majority of all the\u00a0then members of the Council means that the removal of the Vice-President needs the approval of \u00a0101 Rajay Sabha MPs.\n\nAs shown above, this majority is not an Absolute Majority (Total Strength of the House), but an Effective Majority (Total Strength of the House \u2013 Vacancies). Whether the phrase \u201ca majority of all the then members of the Council\u201d can be interpreted as a Simple Majority (Majority among those who are present and voting) is a matter of debate. But anyways, the removal does not need an absolute majority or special majority. It can be said that resolution for the removal of Vice-President requires an effective majority in Rajya Sabha and a simple majority in Loksabha.\n\nNB: President\u2019s impeachment resolution requires a special majority (2/3rd of the total strength of the house) at both houses to get itself passed."

The coordinating work is generally allocated to the Cabinet Secretariat.\nTo Article 75 of the constitution of India, the remuneration of the prime minister as well as other ministers is to be decided by the Parliament. In 2010, the prime minister\u2019s office reported that he did not receive a formal salary, but was only entitled to monthly allowances.\nThe Attorney General, like an Advocate General of a State, is not supposed to be a political appointee, in spirit, but this is not the practice case. Every time a party comes to power in the general elections, all the law officers resign and law officers loyal to the new party are appointed.\nThe Attorney General has the right to audience in all Courts in India as well as the right to participate in the proceedings of the Parliament, though not to vote.\nUnlike the Attorney General of the United States, the Attorney General of India does not have any executive authority and is not a political appointee, those functions are performed by the Law Minister of India.\nThe Attorney General is assisted by a\u00a0Solicitor General\u00a0and four Additional Solicitors General. (Non-constitutional posts.)\nThe Cabinet is a smaller body than the Council of Ministers which consists of a few important senior ministers who are in charge of separate departments. The Cabinet is described as \u201ca wheel within a wheel\u201d. It is the nucleus of the Council of Ministers.\nThe cabinet exercises all powers on behalf of the Council of Ministers. The policy decisions are taken in the Cabinet.\nThere are three categories of ministers (COM), in descending order of\u00a0rank:\nUnion Cabinet Minister: senior minister in charge of a ministry. A cabinet minister may also hold additional charges of other Ministries, where no other Cabinet minister is appointed.\nMinister of State (Independent Charges): with no overseeing Union cabinet minister for that portfolio.\nMinister of State (MoS): junior minister to overseeing cabinet minister, usually tasked with a specific responsibility in that ministry. For instance, an MoS in the Finance Ministry may only handle taxation."

Though the President can return the file, he must sign the recommendation in the event of Cabinet reiterating its decision. ( The case is even then open for Judicial review on grounds of \u201ccompelling\u201d reasons for proven misconduct or other irregularities.)"

They are the Budget Session (February to May); the Monsoon Session (July to September); and the Winter Session (November to December).\n\nA session contains many meetings. Each meeting has two sittings \u2013 morning sitting from 11 am to 1 pm and post-lunch sitting from 2 pm to 6 pm.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nA sitting of Parliament can be terminated by adjournment, adjournment sine die, prorogation or dissolution.\n\nTechnically, a session of the Indian Parliament is the period between the first sitting of a House and its prorogation or dissolution.\n\nThe period between the prorogation of a House and its reassembly in a new session is called \u2018recess\u2019.\n\nSummoning\n\nSummoning is the process of calling all members of the Parliament to meet. It is the duty of Indian President to summon each House of the Parliament from time to time.\n\nThe maximum gap between two sessions of Parliament cannot be more than six months. In other words, the Parliament should meet at least twice a year.\n\nAdjournment\n\nAn adjournment suspends the work in a sitting for a specified time, which may be hours, days or weeks. In this case, the time of reassembly is specified.\n\nAn adjournment only terminates a sitting and not a session of the House.\n\nThe power of adjournment lies with the presiding officer of the House.\n\nAdjournment Sine Die\n\nAdjournment sine die means terminating a sitting of Parliament for an indefinite period. In other words, when the House is adjourned without naming a day for reassembly, it is called adjournment sine die.\n\nThe power of adjournment sine die lies with the presiding officer of the House.\n\nNote:\u00a0The presiding officer of a House can\u00a0call a sitting of the House before the date or time to which it has been\u00a0adjourned or at any time after the House has been adjourned sine die.\n\nProrogation\n\nProrogation means the termination of a session of the House by an order made by the President under article 85(2)(a) of the Constitution. Prorogation terminates both the sitting and session of the House.\n\nUsually, within a few days after the House is adjourned sine die by the presiding officer, the President issues a notification for the prorogation of the session. However, the President can also prorogue the House while in session.\n\nNote:\u00a0All pending notices (other than those for introducing bills) lapse on\u00a0prorogation and fresh notices have to be given for the next session.\n\nDissolution\n\nA dissolution ends the very life of the existing House, and a new House is constituted after general elections are held.\n\nRajya Sabha, being a permanent House, is not subject to dissolution. Only the Lok Sabha is subject to dissolution.\n\nThe dissolution of the Lok Sabha may take place\u00a0in either of two ways:\n\nAutomatic dissolution:\u00a0On the expiry of its tenure \u2013 \u00a0five years or the terms as extended\nduring a national emergency.\nOrder of President:\u00a0If President is authorized by CoM, he can dissolve Lok Sabha, even before the end of the term. He may also dissolve Lok Sabha if CoM loses confidence and no party is able to form the government. Once the\u00a0Lok Sabha is dissolved before the completion of its normal tenure, the dissolution is\u00a0irrevocable.\n\nNote: When the Lok Sabha is dissolved, all business including bills, motions, resolutions, notices, petitions\u00a0and so on pending before it or its committees lapse.\n\nSummary\n\nAdjournment \u2013 terminates a sitting.\nProrogation \u2013 terminates a session.\nDissolution \u2013 terminates the life of a House."

For example, as the total membership of Lok Sabha is 545, an absolute majority in Lok Sabha means \u2013 50% of 545 plus 1, ie. 273.\n\nCases, where the absolute majority is used: In the normal business of the Parliament or State Legislature absolute majority, is not generally used. But this majority is used during the general election, for the formation of government at the Center and States.\n\nAlso read: Parliamentary System\n\nEffective Majority\n\nThe effective Majority of the house means more than 50% of the effective strength of the house. This implies that out of the total strength, we deduct the vacant seats. When the Indian Constitution mentions \u201call the then members\u201d, that refers to the effective majority.\n\nFor example, in Rajya Sabha, out of the total strength of 245 members if there are 45\u00a0vacancies, then the effective strength of the house is 200. Then the effective majority is 50% of 200 plus 1, ie 101.\n\nCases where the effective\u00a0majority is\u00a0used:\n\nRemoval of Vice-president in RS \u2013 Article 67(b).\nRemoval of Speaker and\u00a0Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assembly.\n\nAlso read: Parliament (Articles 79-88/122)\n\nSimple Majority\n\nThis refers to the majority of more than 50% of the members present and voting. This is also known as\u00a0functional majority or working majority. The simple majority is the most frequently used form of majority in Parliamentary business. When the constitution or the laws do not specify the type of majority needed, the simple majority is considered for voting.\n\nTo understand simple majority, let us consider a situation in Lok Sabha. On a particular day, out of the total strength of 545, 45 were absent and 100 abstained from voting on an issue. So only 400 members were present and voting. Then the simple majority is\u00a050% of 400 plus 1, ie.\u00a0201.\n\nOrdinary bills need to be passed with a simple majority in both Houses of the Parliament before it is sent to Indian President for his assent.\n\nCases where the simple\u00a0majority is\u00a0used:\n\nTo pass Ordinary/Money/Financial bills.\nTo pass Non-Confidence Motion/Adjournment Motion/Censure Motion/Confidence Motion.\nFor the removal of Vice President majority required in Lok Sabha is the simple majority \u2013 A67(b).\nTo declare a financial emergency.\nTo declare a state emergency (President\u2019s rule).\nElection of Speaker/Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha and\u00a0State legislatures.\nConstitution Amendment Bill under Article 368 which needs to be ratified by states, require only simple majority at State Legislatures.\nSpecial Majority\n\nAll types of majorities other than the absolute, effective or simple majority is known as the special majority.\u00a0A special majority are of 4 types, with different clauses.\n\nType 1 \u2013 Special Majority as Per Article 249.\nType 2 \u2013 Special Majority as per Article 368.\nType 3 \u2013 Special Majority as per Article 368 + 50 percent state ratification by a simple majority.\nType 4 \u2013 Special Majority as per A61.\nSpecial Majority as Per Article 249\n\nSpecial majority as per article 249 requires a majority of\u00a02/3rd members present and voting. For example, if out of the 245 members in Rajya Sabha, if only 150 are present and voting, then the special majority required as per article 249 would be 101.\n\nCases where special\u00a0majority as per article 249 is\u00a0used:\u00a0To pass the Rajya Sabha resolution to empower the parliament to make laws in the state list. (valid up to 1 year, but can be extended any number of times).\n\nSpecial Majority as Per Article\u00a0368\n\nSpecial majority as per article 368\u00a0requires a majority of\u00a02/3rd members present and voting supported by more than 50% of the total strength of the house. This type of majority is used for most of the Constitutional amendment bills. To pass a constitution amendment bill in Rajya Sabha, in addition to getting the support of 123 members, the bill should be favoured by more than 2/3rd of the members present and voting.\n\nCases where special\u00a0majority as per article 368\u00a0is\u00a0used:\n\nTo pass a constitutional amendment bill that does not affect federalism.\nRemoval of judges of SC/HC.\nRemoval of CEC/CAG.\nApproval of a national emergency requires a special majority as per Article 368 in both houses.\nResolution by the state legislature for the creation/abolition of the Legislative Council (Article 169).\nSpecial Majority as Per Article\u00a0368 plus State ratification\n\nThis type of special majority is required when a constitutional amendment bill tries to change the federal structure. Special majority as per article 368 plus state ratification requires a majority of 2/3rd members present and voting supported by more than 50% of the state legislatures by a simple majority. A good example would be the bill that introduced the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC). It required the support of at least 15 state legislatures out of the 29 states.\n\nCases where special\u00a0majority as per article 368 plus state ratification is\u00a0used:\u00a0To pass a constitutional amendment bill which affects federalism like the position of High Court Judges.\n\nSpecial Majority as Per Article\u00a061\n\nSpecial majority as per Article 61 requires a majority of\u00a02/3rd members of the total strength of the house. In Lok Sabha, the special majority as per Article 61 is 364 while in Rajya Sabha, the special majority as per Article 61 is 164.\n\nCases where special\u00a0majority as per article 61 is used:\u00a0For the impeachment of the Indian President.\n\nAlso read: Parliament and State Legislatures: Structure and Functioning"

What are the types of committees in the Parliament of India?\n\nYou all are familiar with Parliament as a major organ of the state dealing with lawmaking.

Amendments can be moved to various clauses by members of the Committee.\nThe Committee can also take evidence of associations, public bodies or experts who are interested in the Bill.\nAfter the Bill has thus been considered the Committee submits its report to the House.\nMembers who do not agree with the majority report may append their minutes of dissent to the report.\nTypes of Parliamentary Committees\nBased on purpose and duration.\nAdhoc.\nStanding \u2013 Advisory and Enquiry.\nBased on composition.\nSelect \u2013 Single House, ie either LS or RS.\nJoint \u2013 Both Houses.\n-Committee Types-\n\t\nStanding\u00a0 Committee\n\t\nAdhoc Committee\n\n\nSelect Committee\n\t\nEg: Estimate (LS), Ethics Committee (RS)\n\t\nCommittees on Bills (Select)\n\n\nJoint Committee\n\t\nEg: PAC\n\t\nCommittees on Bills ( Joint)\nAd hoc Committees vs\u00a0Standing Committees\n\nAd hoc Committees are appointed for a specific purpose and they cease to exist when they finish the task assigned to them and submit a report.\n\nExamples of ad hoc committees\n\nCommittees on Bills (Select and Joint).\nRailway Convention Committee.\nCommittees on the Draft Five Year Plans.\nHindi Equivalents Committee.\n\nStanding Committees are permanent committees.

Elections to 1/3 of these seats occur every 2 years. Let\u2019s take an example of a state where there is a Rajya Sabha election for 3 seats.\n\nLet there be only two parties in the legislative assembly. Party A has 100 seats and party B has 40 seats. Both parties can field three candidates each for the three Rajya Sabha seats.\n\nTo win a Rajya Sabha seat, a candidate should get the required number of votes. That number (quotient) is found out using the below formula.\n\nQuotient = Total number of votes\u00a0divided by (Number of Rajya Sabha seats + 1 ) + 1.\n\nIn the illustrated case, a candidate requires (140/4)+1, ie. 36 votes to win.\n\nNB: Members don\u2019t vote for each seat. If that had been the case then only the ruling party representatives would make it through. Rather, the members give preferences for each candidate (as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).\n\nIf 36 or more members choose a candidate as their first choice, he gets elected. So Party B (the opposition party in the Loksabha assembly) with 40 seats can get one member elected if the members give preference for a candidate as first preference.\n\nThe ruling party (Party A) on the other hand can get 2 members elected (72 votes from their 100 members).\n\nRead: Cross-voting in elections;\u00a0Green Elections in India"

It is a report of the government finances which includes revenues and outlays.\n\nThus, the budget\u00a0can be defined as the most comprehensive report of the government\u2019s finances in which revenues from all the sources and outlays for all activities are consolidated.\n\nIn simple terms, the budget is an annual financial statement of the revenue and expenditure of a government.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBudget in the Indian Constitution\n\nThe term \u2018Budget\u2019 is not mentioned in the Indian Constitution; the corresponding term used is \u2018Annual Financial Statement\u2019 (article 112).\n\nWhat are the constitutional requirements which make Budget necessary?\nArticle 265: provides that \u2018no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law\u2019. [ie. Taxation needs the approval of Parliament.]\nArticle 266: provides that \u2018no expenditure can be incurred except with the authorisation of the Legislature\u2019 [ie. Expenditure needs the approval of Parliament.]\nArticle 112: President shall, in respect of every financial year, cause to be laid before Parliament, Annual Financial Statement.\nFRBM Act\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act was passed by the Indian Parliament in 2003 for better budget management.\n\nThe FRBM act also provided for certain documents to be tabled in the Parliament of India, along with Budget, annually with regards to the country\u2019s fiscal policy.\n\nBudget Documents\n\nDo you know that the Annual Financial Statement is only one of the several budget documents presented by the Finance Minister?\n\nThe Budget documents presented to Parliament comprise, besides the Finance Minister\u2019s Budget Speech, the following:\n\nAnnual Financial Statement (AFS) \u2013 Article 112\nDemands for Grants (DG) \u2013 Article 113\nAppropriation Bill \u2013 Artice 114(3)\nFinance Bill \u2013 Article 110 (a)\nMemorandum Explaining the Provisions in the Finance Bill.\nMacro-economic framework for the relevant financial year \u2013 FRBM Act\nFiscal Policy Strategy Statement for the financial year \u2013\u00a0FRBM Act\nMedium Term Fiscal Policy Statement \u2013\u00a0FRBM Act\nMedium Term Expenditure Framework Statement \u2013\u00a0FRBM Act\nExpenditure Budget Volume-1\nExpenditure Budget Volume-2\nReceipts Budget\nBudget at a glance\nHighlights of Budget\nStatus of Implementation of Announcements made in Finance Minister\u2019s Budget Speech of the previous\u00a0financial year.\n\nThere are also other related documents like\u00a0Detailed Demands for Grants,\u00a0Outcome Budget,\u00a0Annual Reports and\u00a0Economic Survey presented along with the budget documents in Parliament.\n\nPS: The documents shown at Serial 1, 2, 3 and 4 are mandated by Art. 112,113, 114(3) and 110(a) of the\u00a0Constitution of India respectively, while the documents at Serial 6,7, 8 and 9 are presented as per the provisions\u00a0of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003. Other documents are in the nature of explanatory\u00a0statements supporting the mandated documents with narrative or other content in a user-friendly format suited\u00a0for quick or contextual references. Hindi version of all these documents is also presented to Parliament.\n\nGovernment Budgeting: Railway Budget Presentation\n\nDo figures related to Railways find mention in Annual Financial Statement or are they part of only Railway budget?\n\nUntil 2016 (for 92 years), the budget of the Indian Railways was presented separately to Parliament and dealt with separately. Even then the receipts and expenditure of the Railways formed part of the Consolidated Fund of India and the figures relating to them are included in the \u2018Annual Financial Statement\u2019.\n\nThe last Railway Budget was presented on 25 February 2016 by Mr. Suresh Prabhu.\n\nSince 2017, Railway Budget is merged with the Union Budget.\n\nGovernment Budgeting: Union Budget Presentation\n\nIn India, the Budget is presented to Parliament on such date as is fixed by the President.\n\nBetween 1999 to 2016, the General Budget was presented at 11 A.M. on the last working day of February.\n\nHowever, since 2017, the Indian Budget is presented on 1 February. As a convention, Economic Survey is also tabled in the Parliament \u2013 one day prior to budget submission, ie on January 31.\n\nNote: In an election year, Budget may be presented twice \u2014 first to secure Vote on Account for a few months and later in full.\n\nVote on Account\n\nThe discussion on the Budget begins a few days after its presentation.\n\nIf the Parliament is not able to vote the entire budget before the commencement of the new financial year (ie. within 1 month or so), the necessity to keep enough finance at the disposal of Government in order to allow it to run the administration of the country remains. A special provision is, therefore, made for \u201cVote on Account\u201d by which Government obtains the Vote of Parliament for a sum sufficient to incur expenditure on various items for a part of the year.\n\nNormally, the Vote on Account is taken for two months only. But during the election year or when it is anticipated that the main Demands and Appropriation Bill will take a longer time than two months, the Vote on Account may be for a period exceeding two months.\n\nSo what exactly is Vote on Account?\n\nVote on Account is a special provision by which the Government obtains the\u00a0Vote of Parliament\u00a0for a sum sufficient to incur expenditure on various items for a part of the year, usually two months.\n\nVote on Account was widely used along with every budget before 2016 when the date of the budget presentation was the last day of February. Now vote on account is used only in special years like the election years (used along with interim budget).\n\nVote on Account deals only with the expenditure part. But the interim budget, as well as full budget, has both receipt and expenditure side.\n\nSo presentation and passing of vote on account is the first stage in the budget passing process. Vote on Account is necessary for the working of the government until the period the full budget is passed.\n\nBudget Speech\n\nThe Budget Speech of the Finance Minister is usually in two parts. Part A deals with the general economic survey of the country while Part B relates to taxation proposals.\n\nHe makes a speech introducing the Budget and it is only in the concluding part of his speech that the proposals for fresh taxation or for variations in the existing taxes are disclosed by him.\n\nThe \u2018Annual Financial Statement\u2019 is laid on the Table of Rajya Sabha at the conclusion of the speech of the Finance Minister in Lok Sabha.\n\nLatest Budget\n\nYou can read the highlights of Budget 2020-2021 here.\n\nLatest Economic Survey\n\nYou can read the highlights of the Economic Survey 2019-2020 here.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the government budget plays a critical role in the economy of any country. It serves as a blueprint for the allocation of resources and guides the government\u2019s spending decisions. A well-designed budget can have a positive impact on economic growth, employment, and social welfare.\n\nRead: Interim Budget 2024"

Generally, one Demand for Grant is presented in respect of each Ministry or Department. However, more than one Demand may be presented for a Ministry or Department depending on the nature of expenditure.\nRegarding Union Territories without Legislature, a separate Demand is presented for each of the Union Territories.\n\nEach Demand first gives the totals of \u2018voted\u2019 and \u2018charged\u2019 expenditure as also the \u2018revenue\u2019 and \u2018capital\u2019 expenditure included in the Demand separately, and also the total of the amount of expenditure for which the Demand is presented.\n\nThis is followed\u00a0by the estimates of expenditure under different major heads of account. The breakup of the expenditure\u00a0under each major head between \u2018Plan\u2019 and \u2018Non-Plan\u2019 is also given.\nThe amounts of recoveries taken in the reduction of expenditure in the accounts are also shown. A summary of Demands for Grants is given at the beginning of this document, while details of \u2018New Service\u2019 or \u2018New Instrument of Service\u2019 such as the formation of a new company, undertaking or a new scheme, etc., if any, are indicated at the end of the document.\n\nAlso read: US Debt Ceiling Crisis and US Federal Government Shut down Explained\n\nAppropriation Bill\n\nUnder Article 114(3) of the Constitution, no amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund without the enactment of such a law by Parliament.\n\nAfter the Demands for Grants are voted by the Lok Sabha, Parliament\u2019s approval of the withdrawal from the Consolidated Fund of the amounts so voted and of the amount required to meet the expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund is sought through the Appropriation Bill.\n\nThe whole process beginning with the presentation of the Budget and ending with discussions and voting on the Demands for Grants requires a sufficiently long time.\nThe Lok Sabha is, therefore, empowered by the Constitution to make any grant in advance in respect of the estimated expenditure for a part of the financial year pending completion of the procedure for the voting of the Demands.\nThe purpose of the \u2018Vote on Account\u2019 is to keep the Government functioning, pending voting of \u2018final supply\u2019. The Vote on Account is obtained from\u00a0Parliament through an Appropriation (Vote on Account) Bill.\nFinance Bill\n\nAt the time of the presentation of the Annual Financial Statement before Parliament, a Finance Bill is also presented in fulfillment of the requirement of Article 110 (1)(a) of the Constitution, detailing the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxes proposed in the Budget.\n\nA Finance Bill is a Money Bill as\u00a0defined in Article 110 of the Constitution. It is accompanied by a Memorandum explaining the provisions\u00a0included in it.\n\nMemorandum Explaining the Provisions in the Finance Bill: To facilitate understanding of the taxation proposals contained in the Finance Bill, the provisions and their\u00a0implications are explained in the document titled Memorandum Explaining the Provisions of the Finance Bill.\n\nAlso read: Debt Sustainability\n\nBudget Documents as per the requirements of the FRBM Act\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM Act), 2003, establishes financial discipline to reduce the fiscal deficit.\n\nMacroeconomic Framework Statement\nThe Macroeconomic Framework Statement presented to Parliament under Section 3(5) of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 and the rules made thereunder contains an assessment of the growth prospects of the economy with specific underlying assumptions.\nIt contains an assessment regarding the GDP growth rate, the fiscal balance of the Central Government, and the external sector balance of the economy.\nFiscal Policy Strategy Statement\nThe Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement, presented to Parliament under Section 3(4) of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, outlines the strategic priorities of the Government in the fiscal area for the ensuing financial year relating to taxation, expenditure, lending, and investments, administered pricing, borrowings, and guarantees.\nThe Statement explains how the current policies are in conformity with sound fiscal management principles and give the rationale for any major deviation in key fiscal measures.\nMedium-term Fiscal Policy Statement\nThe Medium-term Fiscal Policy Statement presented to Parliament under Section 3(2) of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, sets out three-year rolling targets for four specific fiscal indicators about GDP at market prices namely (i) Revenue Deficit, (ii) Fiscal Deficit, (iii) Tax to GDP ratio and (iv) Total outstanding Debt at the end of the year.\nThe Statement includes the underlying assumptions, an assessment of sustainability relating to the balance between revenue receipts and revenue expenditure, and the use of capital receipts including market borrowings for the generation of productive assets.\nMedium-term Expenditure Framework Statement\nThe Medium-term Expenditure Framework Statement presented to Parliament under Section 3 of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 sets forth a three-year rolling target for the expenditure indicators with a specification of underlying assumptions and risks involved.\nThe objective of the MTEF is to provide closer integration between the budget and the FRBM Statements.\nThis Statement is presented separately in the session next to the session in which the Budget is presented, i.e. normally in the Monsoon Session.\nExplanatory Budget Documents\n\nThis documents include Expenditure Budget Volume-1, Expenditure Budget Volume-2,\u00a0 Receipts budget, Budget at a glance, Highlight of budget etc.\n\nExpenditure Budget Volume-1\nThis document deals with revenue and capital disbursements of various Ministries/Departments and gives the estimates in respect of each under \u2018Plan\u2019 and \u2018Non-Plan\u2019.\nIt also gives an analysis of various types of expenditure and broad reasons for the variations in estimates.\nExpenditure Budget Volume-2\nThe provisions made for a scheme or a program may spread over several Major Heads in the Revenue and Capital sections in a Demand for Grants.\nIn the Expenditure Budget Vol. 2, the estimates made for a scheme/program are brought together and shown on a net basis in one place, by Major Heads.\nTo understand the objectives underlying the expenditure proposed for various schemes and programs in the Demands for Grants, suitable explanatory notes are included in this volume in which, wherever necessary, brief reasons for variations between the Budget estimates and Revised estimates for the current year and requirements for the ensuing Budget year are also given.\nReceipts Budget\nEstimates of receipts included in the Annual Financial Statement are further analyzed in the document \u201cReceipts Budget\u201d.\nThe document provides details of tax and non-tax revenue receipts and capital receipts\u00a0and explains the estimates.\nThe document also provides the arrears of tax revenues and non-tax revenues, as\u00a0mandated under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Rules, 2004.\nThe trend of receipts and expenditures along with deficit indicators, statements about the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF), statements of revenues foregone, statements of liabilities, statements of guarantees given by the government, statements of assets, and details of external assistance are also included in Receipts Budget.\nBudget at a Glance\nThis document shows in brief, receipts, and disbursements along with broad details of tax revenues and other receipts. This document also exhibits a broad break-up of expenditure \u2013 Plan and Non-Plan, allocation of Plan outlays by sectors as well as by Ministries/Departments, and details of resources transferred by the Central Government to State and Union Territory Governments.\nThis document also shows the revenue deficit, the gross primary deficit, and the gross fiscal deficit of the Central Government. The excess of the Government\u2019s revenue expenditure over revenue receipts constitutes a revenue deficit for the Government.\nThe difference between the total expenditure of the Government by way of revenue, capital, and loans net of repayments on the one hand and revenue receipts of the Government and capital receipts which are not like borrowing but which finally accrue to the Government on the other, constitutes gross fiscal deficit.\nGross primary deficit is measured by gross fiscal deficit reduced by gross interest payments. In the Budget documents \u2018gross fiscal deficit\u2019 and \u2018gross primary deficit\u2019 have been referred to in abbreviated form \u2018fiscal deficit\u2019 and \u2018primary deficit\u2019, respectively.\nThis document also shows the liabilities of the Government on account of securities (bonds) issued instead of oil and fertilizer subsidies.\nHighlights of Budget\nThis document explains the key features of the Budget, inter alia, indicating the prominent achievements in various sectors of the economy. It also explains, in brief, the budget proposals for the allocation of funds to be made in important areas.\nThe summary of tax proposals is also reflected in the document.\n\nAlso read: Capital Market Overview\n\nOther Budget Documents Along with Budget Statements\n\nThis includes detailed demand for grants, outcome budget, annual reports, and economic survey.\n\nDetailed Demands for Grants\nThe Detailed Demands for Grants are laid on the table of the Lok Sabha sometime after the presentation of the Budget, but before the discussion on Demands for Grants commences.\nDetailed Demands for Grants further elaborate on the provisions included in the Demands for Grants as also actual expenditure during the previous year.\nA breakup of the estimates relating to each program/organization, wherever the amount involved is not less than 10 lakhs, is given under several object heads which indicate the categories and nature of expenditure incurred on that program, like salaries, wages, travel expenses, machinery and equipment, grants-in-aid, etc.\nAt the end of these Detailed Demands are shown the details of recoveries taken in reduction of expenditure in the accounts.\nOutcome Budget\nWith effect from Financial Year 2007-08, the Performance Budget and the Outcome Budget hitherto presented to Parliament separately by Ministries/Departments, are merged and presented as a single document titled \u201cOutcome Budget\u201d by each Ministry/Department in respect of all Demands/Appropriations controlled by them, except those exempted from this requirement.\nOutcome Budget broadly indicates the physical dimensions of the financial budget of a Ministry/Department, indicating actual physical performance in the preceding year, performance in the first nine months (up to December) of the current year and the targeted performance during the ensuing year.\nAnnual Reports\nA descriptive account of the activities of each Ministry/Department during the year is given in the document Annual Report which is brought out separately by each Ministry/Department and circulated to Members of Parliament at the time of discussion on the Demands for Grants.\nEconomic Survey\nThe Economic Survey brings out the economic trends in the country which facilitates a better appreciation\u00a0of the mobilisation of resources and their allocation in the Budget.\nThe Survey analyses the trends in agricultural and industrial production, infrastructure, employment, money supply, prices, imports, exports, foreign exchange reserves, and other relevant economic factors which have a bearing on the Budget and is presented to the Parliament ahead of the Budget for the ensuing year.\nConclusion\n\nThe Budget of the Central Government is not merely a statement of receipts and expenditures. Since Independence, with the launching of the Five Year Plans, it has also become a significant statement of government policy.\n\nThe Budget reflects and shapes, and is, in turn, shaped by the country\u2019s economy. For a better\u00a0appreciation of the impact of government receipts and expenditure on the other sectors of the economy, it is\u00a0necessary to group them in terms of economic magnitudes, for example, how much is set aside for capital\u00a0formation, how much is spent directly by the Government and how much is transferred by Government to\u00a0other sectors of the economy by way of grants, loans, etc.\n\nThis analysis is contained in the Economic and\u00a0Functional Classification of the Central Government Budget which is brought out by the Ministry of Finance separately."

Besides, Article 114 (3) of the Constitution stipulates that no amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund without the enactment of a law (appropriation bill).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Parliamentary Approval takes its time!\n\nThe full budget is usually passed only after long discussions.\u00a0Even though the government (executive) seeks approval of expenditure for the next financial year (April 1 to March 31) in the current financial year itself, the approval from legislature takes its time.\n\nVery often, discussion and voting of demands for grants and passing of Appropriation Bill\u00a0go beyond the current financial year. This was precisely the case before 2016 when the budget was presented on the last working day of February, and it was difficult to get passed within the same financial year.\n\nBut the government needs money for its day to day functions\u2026\n\nSince Parliament is not able to vote the entire budget before the commencement of the new financial year, the necessity to keep enough finance at the disposal of Government.\n\nA special provision is, therefore, made for \u201cVote on Account\u201d by which Government obtains the Vote of Parliament for a sum sufficient to incur expenditure on various items for a part of the year.\n\nVote on Account\n\nVote on Account\u00a0is a\u00a0grant in advance to enable the government to carry on until the voting of demands for grants and the passing of the Appropriation Bill and Finance Bill.\n\n\nThis enables the government to fund its expenses for a short period of time or until a full-budget is passed.\u00a0As a convention, a vote-on-account is treated as a formal matter and passed by Lok Sabha without discussion.\n\nVote on Account was frequently used until 2016 when the Budget was presented on the last working day of February. However, since 2017, the budget presentation date was advanced to February 1. This helped the executive to use almost 2 months time to get the full-budget passed in the same financial year. So, since 2017, Vote on Account is not usually used as part of the government budgeting process, unless in special cases like an election year.\n\nNormally, the Vote on Account is taken for two months only.\u00a0The\u00a0sum of the grant would be equivalent to one-sixth of the estimated expenditure for the entire year under various demands for grants.\n\nCan Vote on Account be granted for more than 2 months?\n\nYes.\u00a0During election year or when it is anticipated that the main Demands and Appropriation Bill will take longer time than two months, the Vote on Account may be granted for a period exceeding two months.\n\nFor example, in 2019, Vote on Account is taken for 4 months.\n\nDifference between Full Budget and\u00a0Vote on Account\nFull Budget deals with both expenditure and revenue side but Vote-on-account deals only with the expenditure side of the government\u2019s budget.\nThe vote-on-account is normally valid for two months\u00a0but a full budget is valid for 12 months (a financial year).\nAs a convention, a vote-on-account is treated as a formal matter and passed by Lok Sabha without discussion. But passing for budget happens only after discussions and voting on demand for grants.\nA vote-on-account cannot alter direct taxes since they need to be passed through a finance bill. Under the regular Budget, fresh taxes may be imposed and old ones may go.\nAs a convention, a vote-on-account is treated as a formal matter and passed by the Lok Sabha without discussion. But the full budget is passed only after discussions and voting on demand for grants.\nWhat is an interim budget then?\n\nAn interim budget in all practical sense is a full budget but made by the government during the last year of its term \u2013 ie. just before the election.\u00a0An interim Budget is a complete set of accounts, including both expenditure and receipts. But it may not contain big policy proposals.\n\nIs it mandatory for the government to present vote on account instead of a full budget in an election year?\n\nIt is not mandatory for the government to present a vote on account in an election year.\n\nThough the convention is to present an interim budget and get the fund required for spending via the vote on account route, the government (if it wishes so) can even go for a Full Budget and get the appropriation bills passed to get the finances.\n\nHowever, during an election year,\u00a0the ruling government generally opts for a vote-on-account or interim budget instead of a full budget. While technically, it is not mandatory for the government to present a vote-on-account, but it would be inappropriate to impose policies that may or may not be acceptable to the incoming government taking over in the same year.\n\nRead: Interim Budget 2024"

Read further to know more.\n\nThe basic structure doctrine is one of the fundamental judicial principles connected with the Indian Constitution.\n\nThe doctrine of the basic structure holds that there is a basic structure to the Indian Constitution, and the Parliament of India cannot amend the basic features.\n\nIt was in the Kesanvnda Bharati vs State of Kerala case, the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court ruled by a 7-6 verdict that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution so long as it did not alter or amend the basic structure or essential features of the Constitution.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the Basic Structure Doctrine?\nTimeline for Evolution of Basic Structure\nPre \u2013 Golak Nath Era\nGolak Nath v. the State of Punjab\nConstitution 24th Amendment\nKesvananda Bharati v. the State of Kerala\nEvolution of Basic Structure Doctrine\nConclusion\nWhat is the Basic Structure Doctrine?\n\nIndian Constitution is a dynamic document that can be amended according to the needs of society whenever required. Constitution under Article 368 grants power to the Parliament to amend whenever there is a necessity. The Article also lays down the procedure for amendment in detail.\n\nThe doctrine of basic structure is nothing but a judicial innovation to ensure that the power of amendment is not misused by Parliament. The idea is that the basic features of the Constitution of India should not be altered to an extent that the identity of the Constitution is lost in the process.\n\nIndian Constitution upholds certain principles which are the governing rules for the Parliament, any amendment cannot change these principles and this is what the doctrine of basic structure upholds. The doctrine as we have today was not present always but over the years it has been propounded and upheld by the judicial officers of this country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn this article, we would dwell in detail on the evolution of the doctrine of basic structure and what are the features of the Constitution of India that have been regarded as part of the basic structure by the hon\u2019ble courts.\n\nTimeline for Evolution of Basic Structure\n\nPre \u2013 Golak Nath Era\n\nThe Constitution of India was amended as early as 1951, which introduced the much-debated Article(s) 31A and 31B to it. Article 31B created the 9th Schedule which stated that any law provided under it could not be challenged for the violation of Fundamental Rights as per Article 13(2) of the Constitution. Article 13(2) states that the Parliament shall not draft any law which abridges the rights conferred under Part III and to that extent it shall be void.\n\nA petition was filed in the Supreme Court of India challenging Article(s) 31A and 31B on the ground that they abridge or take away rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution which is against the spirit of Article 13(2) and hence should be declared void. In this case, Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India, the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court held that the power to amend the Constitution including the Fundamental Rights is conferred under Article 368, and the word \u2018Law\u2019 as mentioned under Article 13(2) does not include an amendment of the Constitution. There is a distinction between Parliament\u2019s law-making power, that is, the legislative power and Parliament\u2019s power to amend or constituent powers.\n\nAfter this, several amendments were brought to the Constitution and once again the scope of amendments was challenged in the Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan. The five-judge bench in Sajjan Singh dealt with the validity of the 17th Constitutional Amendment which had added around 44 statutes to the 9th Schedule. Though all of the judges agreed with the decision of Shankari Prasad but for the first time in the concurring opinion by Hidyatullah and Mudholkar JJ doubts were raised on the unfettered power of Parliament to amend the Constitution and curtail the fundamental rights of the citizens.\n\nGolak Nath v. the State of Punjab\n\nIn this case, three writ petitions were clubbed together. The first one was by children of Golak Nath, against the inclusion of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953 in the Ninth Schedule. The other two petitions had challenged the inclusion of the Mysore Land Reforms Act in the Ninth Schedule. It is an 11 judge bench decision, wherein the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court by a majority of 6:5 held that the fundamental rights were outside the purview of the amendment of the Constitution, based on the following reasoning:\n\nThe power of Parliament to amend the Constitution does not subside in Article 368 but it is derived from Article 245, read with Entry 97 of List I of the Constitution. It was very clearly stated that Article 368 only provided for the Procedure of Amendment and nothing more.\nThe Court also clarified that the word \u2018law\u2019 under Article 13(2) includes within its meaning an amendment to the Constitution. Therefore any amendment against the Fundamental Rights was void.\nThe argument that the power to amend the Constitution is a sovereign power, which is over and above the legislative power and hence outside the scope of judicial review was rejected.\n\nHowever, the 1st, 4th, and 17th Amendments were not declared invalid by the Court as the ruling was given a prospective effect. This meant that no further amendments could be brought into the Constitution violating fundamental rights. But the cases of Shankari Prasad and Sajjan Singh were declared bad in law by the Court to the extent that Article 13(2) does not include a Constitutional amendment under Article 368.\n\nConstitution 24th Amendment\n\nThe Golak Nath case left the Parliament devoid of its powers to amend the Constitution freely, therefore to restore the earlier position; the 24th Constitutional Amendment was brought forth. The Amendment Act not only restored the earlier position but extended the powers of Parliament. The following changes were made through the amendment:\n\nA new clause (4) was added to Article 13 which stated that \u2018nothing in this Article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under Article 368\u2019.\nThe marginal heading of Article 368 was changed to \u2018Power of Parliament to amend the Constitution and Procedure, therefore\u2019 from \u2018Procedure for amendment of the Constitution.\nArticle 368 was provided with a new sub-clause (1) which read \u2018notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, Parliament may, in the exercise of its Constituent Power amend by way of addition, variation, or repeal any provision of this Constitution in accordance with the procedure laid down in this Article.\nPresident was put under an obligation to give assent to any Bill amending the Constitution by changing words from \u2018it shall be presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill and thereupon\u2019 to \u2018it shall be presented to the President for his assent and upon such assent being given to the Bill\u2019.\nA reassuring clause (3) was also added to Article 368, which again clarified that \u2018nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment made under this Article.\nKesvananda Bharati v. the State of Kerala\n\nThis case was initially filed to challenge the validity of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, of 1963. But the 29th Amendment of the Constitution placed it under the Ninth Schedule. The petitioner was permitted to not only challenge the 29th Amendment but also the validity of the 24th and 25th Amendments.\n\nThe historic judgment was delivered by a 13-judge bench and with a majority of 7:6; they overruled the Golak Nath case. It was held that the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution is far and wide and extends to all the Articles but it is not unlimited to an extent that it destroys certain basic features or framework of the Constitution.\n\nThe Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court, however, held that the 24th Amendment was valid as it only states what was present before implicitly. It does not enlarge the powers of Parliament; Article 368 always included the power and procedure to amend the Constitution.\n\nThe judges did not provide what constitutes the basic structure but provided an illustrative list of what may constitute the basic structure. As per Sikri, C.J., the basic structure constitutes the following elements:\n\nThe supremacy of the Constitution\nRepublican and Democratic forms of Government\nSecular character of the Constitution\nSeparation of Powers between the legislature, the Executive, and the Judiciary\nFederal Character of the Constitution\n\nShelat and Grover, JJ., added the following to the above list:\n\nThe mandate to build a welfare state contained in the Directive Principles of State Policy\nMaintenance of the unity and integrity of India\nThe sovereignty of the country\n\nHegde and Mukherjee, JJ., had their list of the elements of the basic structure, which included:\n\nThe sovereignty of India\nThe democratic character of the polity\nThe unity of the country\nEssential features of individual freedom\nThe mandate to build a welfare state\n\nWhereas Jaganmohan Redd, J., believed that it was the Preamble that laid down the basic features of the Constitution, which are:\n\nA sovereign democratic republic\nThe provision of social, economic, and political justice\nLiberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship\nEquality of status and opportunity\n\nAfter this judgment, the general opinion was that the judiciary is trying to create an overhaul over the Parliament, but soon an opportunity was laid down before the Court to examine the doctrine.\n\nEvolution of Basic Structure Doctrine\n\nIndra Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain was the case in which the faith in the doctrine was affirmed and established. In this case, the appellant had filed an appeal against the decision of Allahabad High Court invalidating her election as the Prime Minister. While the appeal was still pending at the Supreme Court, the 39th Amendment was enacted and enforced which stated that no court has jurisdiction over the election disputes of the Prime Minister.\n\nThe Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court relying on the decision of Kesavananda Bharati stated that democracy was an essential feature of the Constitution and forms part of the basic structure. The bench added certain other features to the list of the basic structure, which was: Rule of Law and the power of Judicial Review.\n\nThe basic structure then came up in the case of Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India, wherein the Supreme Court provided clarity to the doctrine and laid down that the power of amendment under Article 368 is limited and exercise of such power cannot be absolute. A limited amending power was very well part of the basic structure doctrine of the Constitution. Further, the harmony and balance between fundamental rights and directive principles are also part of the basic structure, and anything that destroys the balance is an ipso facto violation of the doctrine.\n\nThe case of L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India again stated that the power of judicial review under Article 32 of the Supreme Court and Article 226 of the High Court is part of the basic structure doctrine and these powers cannot be diluted by transferring them to administrative tribunals.\n\nAlso read: Indian Judicial Doctrines \u2013 Principles of Constitutional Law Explained\n\nConclusion\n\nToday there is no dispute regarding the existence of the doctrine, the only problem that arises time and again is the contents of the same.\n\nCertain contents have been reaffirmed again and again by the Courts whereas some of them are still in the process of deliberations.\n\nThe basic structure doctrine grants the fine balance between flexibility and rigidity that should be present in the amending powers of any Constitution.\n\nBibliography\n\n\u2018Important Judgments that transformed India\u2019 by Alex Andrews George\nM.P.

Many of you may be familiar with the Doctrine of Basic Structure. In this article, we will be dealing all important Indian Judicial Doctrines.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDoctrine of Basic Structure\nDoctrine of Harmonious Construction\nDoctrine of Eclipse\nDoctrine of Pith and Substance\u00a0\n\u00a0Doctrine of Incidental or Ancillary Powers\nDoctrine of Colourable Legislation\nDoctrine of Severability\nDoctrine of Territorial Nexus\n\u00a0Doctrine of Laches\nOther Important Indian Judicial Doctrines\nDoctrine of Basic Structure\n\nThe basic structure doctrine is an Indian judicial principle that the Constitution of India has certain basic features that cannot be altered or destroyed through amendments by the parliament.\n\nBut what should be considered as the basic features of the Indian Constitution is not explicitly defined by the Judiciary. It is widely believed that democracy, federalism, independence of the judiciary, secularism etc. are part of the basic features.\n\nThe claim of any particular feature of the Constitution to be a \u201cbasic\u201d feature is determined by the Court on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThis doctrine was first expressed in Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala (1973). Thanks to Kesavananda Bharati, Palkhivala and the seven judges who were in the majority, India continues to be the world\u2019s largest democracy.\n\nDoctrine of Harmonious Construction\nThis doctrine was brought about to bring harmony between the different lists mentioned in the\u00a0Schedule 7 of the Constitution of India. Different subjects are mentioned in different lists in this schedule.\nHowever, there can be a situation where an entry of one list overlaps with that of another list. This is the time when this doctrine comes into the picture.\nIt was said that the words of the entries should be given wide amplitude and the courts shall bring harmony between the different entries and lists.\nSupreme Court applied this Doctrine in the case of Tika Ramji vs the State of UP.\nDoctrine of Eclipse\nThe doctrine states that if any law becomes contradictory to the fundamental rights, then it does not permanently die but becomes inactive.\nAs soon as that fundamental right is omitted from the Constitution, the inactive law becomes revived.\nWhen a court strikes a part of the law, it becomes unenforceable. Hence, an \u2018eclipse\u2019 is said to be cast on it. The law just becomes invalid but continues to exist.\nThe eclipse is removed when another (probably a higher level court) makes the law valid again or an amendment is brought to it by way of legislation.\nSupreme Court first applied this doctrine in the case of Bhikaji vs State of Madhya Pradesh where it applied to pre-constitutional law. The extension to the post-constitutional law was stated in the case of Dulare Lodh vs ADJ Kanpur.\nDoctrine of Pith and Substance\u00a0\nThis doctrine comes into picture when there is a conflict between the different subjects in different lists. There is an interpretation of List 1 and List 2 of the Constitution of India.\nThere can be a situation when a subject of one list touche the subject of another List. Hence this doctrine is applied then.\nPith and Substance means the true nature of law.\nThe real subject matter is challenged and not its incidental effect on another field.\nThe doctrine has been applied in India also to provide a degree of flexibility in the otherwise rigid scheme of distribution of powers.\nThe reason for the adoption of this doctrine is that if every legislation were to be declared invalid on the grounds that it encroached powers, the powers of the legislature would be drastically circumscribed.\nIt was applied by the Supreme Court in the case\u00a0State of Bombay Vs F.N Balasar.\n\u00a0Doctrine of Incidental or Ancillary Powers\n\nThis principle is an addition to the doctrine of Pith and Substance.\nWhat it means is that the power to legislate on a subject also includes the power to legislate on ancillary matters that are reasonably connected to that subject.\nFor example, the power to impose tax would include the power to search and seizure to prevent the evasion of that tax. However, power relating to banking cannot be extended to include power relating to non-banking entities.\nHowever, if a subject is explicitly mentioned in a State or Union list, it cannot be said to be an ancillary matter. For example, the power to tax is mentioned in specific entries in the lists and so the power to tax cannot be claimed as ancillary to the power relating to any other entry of the lists.\nAs held in the case of State of Rajasthan vs G Chawla AIR 1959, the power to legislate on a topic includes the power to legislate on an ancillary matter which can be said to be reasonably included in the topic.\nHowever, this does not mean that the scope of the power can be extended to any unreasonable extent. Supreme Court has consistently cautioned against such extended construction. For example, in R M D Charbaugwala vs State of Mysore, AIR 1962, SC held that betting and gambling is a state subject as mentioned in Entry 34 of State list but it does not include power to impose taxes on betting and gambling because it exists as a separate item as Entry 62 in the same list.\nDoctrine of Colourable Legislation\nThis is applied when the legislature enacting the law has transgressed its power as is mentioned in the Constitution.\nThe expression \u201ccolourable legislation\u201d simply means what cannot be done directly, cannot be done indirectly too.\nIt is the substance that is material and not the outward appearance.\nHence there are certain situations when it seems that it is within the power of the legislature enacting the law but actually it is transgressing. This is when this doctrine comes into the picture.\nIt was applied by the Supreme Court of India in the case State of Bihar vs Kameshwar Singh and it was held that the Bihar Land Reforms Act was invalid.\nDoctrine of Severability\nAccording to this doctrine, if there is any offending part in a statute, then, only the offending part is declared void and not the entire statute.\nArticle 13 states that the portion that is invalid should be struck off and not the entire one. The valid part can be kept.\nHowever, it should be kept in mind that even after separation; the remaining part should not become ambiguous.\nIf the remaining part becomes ambiguous, then the whole statute would be declared void and of no use.\nSupreme Court in the case of RMDC vs. UOI states that doctrine of severability is a matter of substance and not of form.\nDoctrine of Territorial Nexus\nArticle 245 states that a state legislature can make laws on the territory of the state and not on extraterritorial laws provided there is nexus or connection between the sate and the object of the legislation.\nArticle 245(1) states that the Parliament of India can make laws for the whole or any territory of India.\nSimilarly, a state legislature can do the same.\nSuch laws cannot be declared invalid on the growth that they are extraterritorial according to Article 245(2).\nTo determine whether a particular legislation is within the territorial nexus or not, this doctrine is applied.\nSupreme Court applied this doctrine in the case of Tata Iron Steel vs. the State of Bihar.\n\u00a0Doctrine of Laches\nLaches means delay. The doctrine of laches is based on the maxim that \u201cequity aids the vigilant and not those who slumber on their rights.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary).\nThe outcome is that a legal right or claim will not be enforced or allowed if a long delay in asserting the right or claim has prejudiced the adverse party.\nElements of laches include knowledge of a claim, unreasonable delay, neglect, which taken together hurt the opponent.\nIt is well known that one who wants remedy must come before the court within a reasonable time.\nLapse of time violates equity and it is against the concept of justice.\nHence the issue came up whether delay can be a ground to deny fundamental rights under Article 32.\nIt was said that denial of fundamental rights only on the ground of delay is not justified as fundamental rights are basic and very essential for the development of the individual.\nSupreme Court under the case of Ravindra Jain vs UOI stated that remedy under article 32 can be denied on grounds of unreasonable delay. However, there has been no case to overrule the above-mentioned case law by the Supreme Court order.\nOther Important Indian Judicial Doctrines\n\nThere are many other doctrines followed by Indian Judiciary.

Procedure Established by Law and Due Process of Law.\n\n\u201cProcedure Established by Law\u201d and \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d are two legal principles that relate to the protection of individual rights and the application of law in legal proceedings. While these principles may seem similar, they have distinct implications and are used in different legal systems around the world.\n\nThe former is Indian constitutional doctrine and the latter is American, but now the boundaries are very narrow.\n\nLet\u2019s start our discussion with Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.

Due Process of Law has much wider significance, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution. The due process doctrine is followed in the United States of America, and Indian constitutional framers purposefully left that out. But in most of the recent judgments of the supreme court, the due process aspect is coming into the picture again. Let\u2019s see the difference in detail.\n\nCase 1: Procedure Established by Law\n\n\u201cProcedure Established by Law\u201d is a principle that is primarily associated with legal systems based on common law, including India. In countries following this principle, the government enacts laws, and individuals must comply with those laws.\n\nThe government has the authority to set the procedures and processes for implementing and enforcing these laws. Under this principle, as long as the government follows the procedures it has established, its actions are considered valid, even if they may appear unfair or unjust to individuals.\n\nIt means that a law that is duly enacted by the legislature or the concerned body is valid if it has followed the correct procedure. Following this doctrine means that, a person can be deprived of his life or personal liberty according to the\u00a0procedure established by law.\n\nSo, if Parliament passes a law, then the life or personal liberty of a person can be taken off according to the provisions and procedures of that law.\n\nThis doctrine has a major flaw. What is it?\n\nIt does not seek whether the laws made by Parliament are fair, just, and not arbitrary.\n\n\u201cProcedure established by law\u201d means a law duly enacted is valid even if it\u2019s contrary to principles of justice and equity. The strict following of the procedure established by law may raise the risk of compromise to the life and personal liberty of individuals due to unjust laws made by the law-making authorities. It is to avoid this situation, SC stressed the importance of the due process of law.\n\nCase 2: Due Process of Law\n\nDue process of law doctrine not only checks if there is a law to deprive the life and personal liberty of a person but also sees if the law made is fair, just, and not arbitrary.\n\nIf SC finds that any law is not fair, it will declare it null and void. This doctrine provides for a more fair treatment of individual rights.\n\nUnder due process, it is the legal requirement that the state must respect all of the legal rights that are owed to a person, and laws that the state enacts must conform to the laws of the land like \u2013 fairness, fundamental rights, liberty, etc. It also gives the judiciary to access fundamental fairness, justice, and liberty of any legislation.\n\n\u201cDue Process of Law\u201d is a legal principle commonly found in legal systems based on the common law tradition, particularly in countries like the United States.\n\nUnder this principle, the government must follow fair and just procedures before depriving an individual of life, liberty, or property. Due process ensures that individuals have the right to be heard, to present evidence, and to be treated fairly before any government action is taken against them.\n\nThe difference in layman\u2019s terms is as below:\u00a0Due Process of Law = Procedure Established by Law + The procedure should be fair and just and not arbitrary.\n\nAlso read: Must Know Articles of Indian Constitution\n\nExtra Articles worth reading\nOf constitutional \u2018due process\u2019: The Hindu \u2013 Are we shifting from original constitutional norms?\nOn MCOCA: Tehelka \u2013\u00a0A Law Inconsistent With The Idea Of India.\nDue Process of law: Manupatra.\nHistory of Due Process of Law\n\nDue process developed from clause 39 of the Magna Carta in England. When English and American law gradually diverged, due process was not upheld in England but did become incorporated into the Constitution of the United States.\n\nUnlike \u201cProcedure Established by Law,\u201d \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d requires the government to respect certain fundamental rights and treat individuals fairly and impartially. It places a higher emphasis on individual rights and procedural safeguards.\n\nIn the United States, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution include the Due Process Clause, which prohibits the government from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\n\nProcedure established by law: Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India case (1978)\n\nIn India, a liberal interpretation is made by the judiciary after 1978 and it has tried to make the term \u2018Procedure established by law\u2019 synonymous with \u2018Due process\u2019 when it comes to protecting individual rights.\n\nIn the Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India case (1978) SC held that \u2013 the\u00a0\u2018procedure established by law\u2019 within the meaning of Article 21 must be \u2018right and just and fair\u2019 and \u2018not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive\u2019 otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied. Thus, the \u2018procedure established by law\u2019 has acquired the same significance in India as the \u2018due process of law clause in America.\n\nConclusion\n\n\u201cProcedure Established by Law\u201d focuses on the formal adherence to legal procedures set by the government, while \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d emphasizes the protection of individual rights and fairness in the application of law and legal proceedings.\n\nThe choice between these principles has significant implications for the protection of individual rights in a legal system."

Also, judicial review can only correct a \u201cpatent error\u201d and not \u201cminor mistakes of inconsequential import\u201d.\n\nThe provision of review is an exception to the principle of stare decisis. Principle of stare decisis binds courts to follow legal precedents set by previous decisions.\n\nConstitutional Provisions behind Review Petition\n\nUnder Article 137 of the Constitution of India and the rules made under Article 145, the Supreme Court of India has the power to review its judgment pronounced by it.\n\nAs per Supreme Court rules, a review petition is to be filed within 30 days of the pronouncement of judgment or order and that petition should be circulated without oral arguments to the same bench that delivered the judgment.\n\nWho can file a review petition?\n\nIt is not necessary that only parties to a case can seek a review of the judgment on it. As per the Civil Procedure Code and the Supreme Court Rules, any person aggrieved by judgment can seek a review.\n\nNo oral arguments by lawyers except in death penalty cases\n\nReview petitions would ordinarily be entertained without oral arguments by lawyers. It is heard \u201cthrough circulation\u201d by the judges in their chambers.\n\nIn exceptional cases, the court allows an oral hearing. In a 2014 case, the Supreme Court held that review petitions in all death penalty cases will be heard in open court by a Bench of three judges.\n\nWho hears the review petitions?\n\nReview petitions are heard, as far as practicable, by the same combination of judges who delivered the order or judgment that is sought to be reviewed. If a judge has retired or is unavailable, a replacement is made keeping in mind the seniority of judges.\n\nShould the Court allow every review petition?\n\nThe court does not entertain every review petition filed. It exercises its discretion to allow a review petition.\n\nUsually, the court allows a review petition only when it shows the grounds for seeking the review.\n\nGrounds for seeking a review of a judgment\n\nSupreme Court laid down three grounds for seeking a review of a verdict \u2013\n\nthe discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of the petitioner or could not be produced by him;\nmistake or error apparent on the face of the record;\nany sufficient reason that is analogous to the other two grounds.\n\nNote: In the Union of India v. Sandur Manganese & Iron Ores Ltd case (2013), the court laid down nine principles on when a review is maintainable. The court held that a review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and corrected but lies only for patent error.\n\nExamples of review petitions recently in the news\n\nSupreme Court agreed to review its Sabarimala\u00a0verdict but refused to do so in the Rafale case.\n\nWhat if a review petition fails?\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s is the court of last resort. Its verdict should never result in a miscarriage of justice. To prevent the abuse of its process, the court itself evolved the concept of a curative petition, which can be heard after a review is dismissed.\n\nWhat is a Curative Petition?\n\nA curative petition is a judicial innovation and a new concept in the Indian legal system.\n\nIt is the last and final resort to the judicial remedy of any grievances which is not normally given an open-court hearing.\n\nThe origin of curative petitions\n\nThe concept originated from the 2002 case of Rupa Ashok Hurra Vs. Ashok Hurra and Anr. over the question whether an aggrieved person is entitled to any relief against the final judgment/order of the Supreme Court after the dismissal of a review petition.\n\nThe court used the Latin maxim \u201cactus curiae neminem gravabit\u201d, which means that an act of the court shall prejudice no one. Thus, it applies when the court is bound to undo a wrong done to a party by the act of court itself.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that it may reconsider its judgements in order to prevent abuse of its process and to cure gross miscarriage of justice.\n\nConstitutional Provisions behind Curative Petition\n\nCurative Petition is also supported by Article 137 of the Indian Constitution.\n\nA curative petition is needed to provide a final recourse of correcting any errors in judgement where technical difficulties or other apprehensions over reopening a case prevents from reviewing judgements.\n\nWho hears the curative petitions?\n\nCurative petitions are heard by the top three judges including the Chief Justice of India plus the judges who dismissed the review petition.\n\nConditions for Curative Petition\n\nSupreme Court has laid down some specific conditions to entertain curative petitions:\n\nThe petitioner has to establish that the principles of natural justice were violated and fear of the bias of the judge and judgement that adversely affected him.\nThe petition shall state specifically that the grounds mentioned had been taken in the review petition and that it was dismissed by circulation.\nA curative petition must be first circulated to a Bench of the three senior-most judges, and the judges who passed the concerned judgment, if available.\nIf a majority of the judges conclude that the matter needs hearing should it be listed before the same Bench.\nThe Bench at any stage of consideration of the curative petition can ask a senior counsel to assist it as amicus curiae (Friend of the court).\nA curative petition is usually decided by judges in the chamber unless a specific request for an open-court hearing is allowed.\nThe court could impose \u201cexemplary costs\u201d to the petitioner if his plea lacks merit.\nWhat is a Mercy Petition?\n\nMercy Petition is the last resort of a person when all the remedies available to him/her under the prevailing laws and the Constitution are exhausted.\n\nA mercy petition may be filed before the President of India under Article 72 or the Governor of the state under Article 161.\n\nEven though the mercy petition is filed before the President or the Governor of the state, practically, the decision on the petition is taken by the Council of Ministers (CoM).\n\nThe petition will be treated on mercy and not on the legality of the case.\n\nHowever, any arbitrary decision on mercy pleas, including rejection, by the President of India or Governor can be questioned in the Court.\n\nMercy petition in death sentence cases\n\nA mercy petition is the last resort available to a convict having death sentence after all legal and judicial remedies like review and curative petitions are exhausted.\n\nFor seeking mercy petition, the death sentence by a trial court must be confirmed by the High Court. Then the convict has an option to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nIf the Supreme Court either refuses to hear the appeal or upholds the death sentence, then the convict or his relative can submit a mercy petition to the President of India (Articles 72) or the Governor of the State (161).\n\nGrounds upon pardon can be sought\n\nIn a mercy petition, the person concerned is required to state the grounds upon pardon is sought.\n\nThese grounds may not be worth considering from a legal point of view.\n\nBut the grounds such as being the only bread earner of the family, the physical condition of the convict, age or the court committing a mistake or error inadvertently have value while consideration by the President.\n\nSupreme Court in the Kehar Singh v Union of India 1988 case held that the grant of pardon by the President is an act of grace and cannot be claimed as a matter of right.\n\nConstitutional Provisions\nArticle 72 of the Constitution provides that the President shall have the power to grant pardon, reprieve, respite or remission of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence\nin all cases where the punishment or sentence is by a Court Martial;\nin all cases where the punishment or sentence is for an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends;\nin all cases where the sentence is a sentence of death.\nSimilarly, under Article 161 the Governor has the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the State extends\nProcedure for handling Mercy Petitions\n\nThere is no written procedure for dealing with mercy petitions.\n\nA convict under the sentence of death is allowed to make the petition within a period of seven days after the date on which the Superintendent of jail informs him about the dismissal of the appeal by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe petitions are received by the President\u2019s secretariat on behalf of the President, which is then forwarded to the Ministry of Home Affairs for seeking the advice of the Cabinet.\n\nThe Home Ministry in consultation with the concerned State Government discusses the merits of the petition and tenders its advice to the President, on behalf of the Council of Ministers.\n\nThe President can return the recommendation only once for reconsideration. If no change is made, the President has to sign his assent.\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t specify any time-limit within which a mercy petition has to be decided.\n\nNeed for a Standard Procedure while handling Mercy Petition\n\nThere is no guideline or written procedure that the government or the President is bound by while processing mercy petitions.\n\nThere is no opportunity of a personal hearing before the authorities and as a result, all relevant information may not be made available.\n\nUnder the present scheme, there exists a possibility of two persons being treated differently despite having the same grounds, i.e. one person getting relief and another being denied for cases of similar nature.\n\nNo prescribed procedure indicates the possibility of arbitrary exercise of power and consequent discrimination. This is in contravention to Articles 21 and 14 of the Constitution.\n\nIn the absence of any standard procedure, there is no specific time-limit to decide mercy petitions.\n\nThere are instances of mercy petitions lying undecided with the President for over a decade.\n\nIn some cases, the convicts were able to take advantage of the delay and get their death sentences remitted on this ground.\n\nInternational Standards\n\nInternational Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), of which India is a party to, has provisions against torturous, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.\n\nInordinate and unreasonable delay in execution of death sentence amounts to torture as expounded by the Supreme Court in the Shatrughan Chauhan vs Union of India case.\n\nThe ICCPR also establishes the right to life as an inherent, inalienable right that cannot be taken away arbitrarily.\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights preserves equality of all persons before the law and equal protection of the law.\n\nAny discriminatory treatment due to lack of procedure or otherwise stands in violation of these international standards.\n\nMercy Plea vs Capital Punishment\n\nEvery civilized country recognizes the need for providing a pardoning power as an act of grace while many countries have started the debate on the utility of the death penalty itself. The Indian Constitution also recognizes the need for providing a final avenue of justice in the form of mercy petition.\n\nWhile each case is unique, there is a need for a prescribed procedure on handling mercy petitions to remove arbitrariness and to specify definitive grounds for considering relief. Specifying a time limit for disposing of mercy petitions is also needed to allay the apprehensions of both convicts and victims.\n\nExamples of Mercy Petitions recently in the news\n\nRecently the President rejected the mercy petition of one of the convicts of Nirbhaya case. This comes after a Delhi court stayed the death sentence of four convicts for the third time observing that they cannot be executed while a mercy petition is pending before the President.\n\nAs per law, if a convict is awarded death sentence, he has three options \u2014 review petition and curative petition before the Supreme Court and finally mercy petition before the President. In this case, a review of the rejection of the mercy petition was also filed before the Supreme Court.\n\nReview Petition vs Curative Petition vs Mercy Petition: Conclusion\n\nVarious legal remedies available in order of filing: review petition \u2192 curative petition \u2192 mercy petition.\n\nAs per law, if a convict is awarded death sentence, he has three options \u2013 review petition and curative petition before the Supreme Court and finally mercy petition before the President.\n\nWhile the decisions of the lower courts can be reviewed under various articles of the Constitution, a provision for the apex court to review an order passed by them is much needed as a final measure of correcting judicial errors. However, various legal remedies available, including a review of the rejection of mercy petition, are now being used to effectively delay the implementation of the verdict.\n\nIn this context, it is essential to arrive at a balance between speedy justice and following just and reasonable procedures. Certain aspects like specifying the time within which review and curative petitions are to be filed, prescribing procedures that avoid duplication of processes in case of multiple convicts facing death penalty must be addressed. Both rights \u2013 the rights of the accused and the rights of a victim to seek justice are sacrosanct."

Don\u2019t forget to come back to visit this post again as we normally update our articles when SC passes any new observations or guidelines.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCapital Punishment in India: Overview\nRarest of the rare case doctrine\nIPC 376A \u2013\u00a0Rape/Sexual\u00a0Assault\nLaws other than IPC for Capital Punishment\nClemency and Mercy Petition in the Indian Constitution\nWho grants pardon?\nIs everything over, once the President rejects the mercy petition and signs his assent?\nHighlights of recent SC judgment on Mercy Plea (Shatrughan Chauhan vs Union of India)\nExtra articles related to capital punishment worth reading\nCapital Punishment in India: Overview\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

But the imposition of capital punishment is not always followed by execution (even when it is upheld on appeal), because of the possibility of commutation to life imprisonment. The number of people executed in India since independence in 1947 is a matter of dispute; official government statistics claim that only about 60 people have been executed since independence.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHowever, the People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties cited information from Appendix 34 of the 1967 Law Commission of India report showing that 1,422 executions took place in 16 Indian states from 1953 to 1963, and has suggested that the total number of executions since independence may be as high as 3,000 to 4,300.\n\nIn December 2007, India voted against a United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a moratorium on the death penalty. In November 2012, India again upheld its stance on capital punishment by voting against the UN General Assembly draft resolution seeking to ban the death penalty.\n\nRarest of the rare case doctrine\n\nThere are various sections under IPC (302, 376A, etc) and other statutes that award capital punishment to the convict. But the Supreme Court of India ruled in 1983 that the death penalty should be imposed only in \u201cthe rarest of rare cases.\u201d\n\nWhile stating that honor killings fall within the \u201crarest of the rare\u201d category, Supreme Court has recommended the death penalty be extended to those found guilty of committing \u201chonor killings\u201d, which deserve to be a capital crime.\n\nThe Supreme Court also recommended death sentences be imposed on police officials who commit police brutality in the form of encounter killings.\n\nIPC 376A \u2013\u00a0Rape/Sexual\u00a0Assault\n\nAn amendment in the year 2013 provided for the death penalty in case he inflicts an injury upon a woman during rape which causes her death or to be in a persistent vegetative state. The death penalty can also be handed down to repeat rape offenders under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, of 2013.\n\nLaws other than IPC for Capital Punishment\n\nIn addition to the Indian Penal Code, a series of legislation enacted by the Parliament of India have provisions for the death penalty.\n\nCommission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987: Part. II, Section 4(1).\nScheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989: Section 3(2)(i).\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.\nClemency and Mercy Petition in the Indian Constitution\n\nAfter the award of the death sentence by a sessions (trial) court, the sentence must be confirmed by a High Court to make it final.\u00a0Once confirmed, the condemned convict has the option of appealing to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhere the condemned prisoner is unable to appeal to the Supreme Court; or where the court either refuses to hear the appeal or upholds the death sentence, the prisoner also has the option of submitting a \u2018mercy petition\u2019 to the President of India and the Governor of the State. \u00a0\n\nWho grants pardon?\n\nArticle 72(1) of the Constitution of India states:\n\nThe President shall have the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence\u00a0where the sentence is a sentence of death.\n\nDespite the language of the constitutional provisions, clemency is exercised not by the President but by the government.\n\nFor all practical purposes, the decision on a mercy petition is arrived at within the MHA as the subject has been allocated to the Department of Home, MHA vide the second schedule of the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules 1961. Once a convict submits a mercy petition to the President, the Rashtrapathi Bhavan forwards the petition to the Ministry of Home Affairs, for seeking the Cabinet\u2019s advice on the matter.\n\nThe MHA then forwards the same to the concerned State Government for eliciting its views.\n\nIt is only then the MHA formulates its advice and tenders it to the President, on behalf of the Council of Ministers).\n\nA memorandum on the case is prepared by a junior official in the Ministry and based on the same, a Joint Secretary or an Additional Secretary \u2018recommends\u2019 a decision to commute the death sentence or reject the mercy petition. This \u2018recommendation\u2019 is considered by the Minister of Home Affairs who makes the final \u2018recommendation\u2019, on behalf of the Cabinet of Ministers, to the President.\n\nArticle 74(1) provides the President with only one opportunity to return the \u2018recommendation\u2019 for the decision to be reviewed. If no change is made, the President has to sign his assent.\n\nPS: The Constitution doesn\u2019t have any maximum time limit within which a mercy petition has to be decided. There have been instances of mercy petitions lying with the President for over a decade without any decision being taken. The MHA can\u2019t ask the President to speed up the process. Similarly, a mercy petition may get delayed at MHA or state level too.\n\nIs everything over, once the President rejects the mercy petition and signs his assent?\n\nNo.\n\nThings are not over here.\n\nThere is still hope for the convict.\n\nPresident\u2019s pardon/rejection/delay is also subjected to judicial review. A delay in deciding mercy plea is a relevant ground for commuting the death sentence to life imprisonment. This is what happened in the recent Shatrughan Chauhan vs Union of India case.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also directed all prison authorities to give a gap of 14 days between intimation of the rejection of the mercy petition to the condemned prisoner and his actual execution. In this period, the convict can seek judicial redress of grievances against the rejection of a mercy plea. Also note that if the President grants an unfair pardon, SC can overrule it.\n\nSo the long route of capital punishment can be summarized as follows :\n\nTrail court awards death sentence.\nThe high court confirms it.\nSupreme Court confirms it on appeal.\nMercy petition filed to President of India.\nThe President of India forwards it to the Ministry of Home Affairs.\nMinistry of Home Affairs routes it to the state concerned.\nThe state lets MHA know its advice.\nMHA forwards its recommendation to the President of India.\nThe President of India rejects that advice and asks MHA to reconsider it.\nMHA submits its recommendation again.\nThe President of India signs it. Mercy is denied.\nThe convict can ask for a Judicial review.\nThe Judicial review verdict is final.\nHighlights of recent SC judgment on Mercy Plea (Shatrughan Chauhan vs Union of India)\n\nThe following are the 12\u00a0guidelines issued by the Supreme Court bench comprising Chief Justice P. Sathasivam, Justice Ranjan Gogoi, and Justice Shiva Kirti Singh on various procedures before executing a death convict.\n\nSolitary Confinement: (only in the last 14 days)\nLegal Aid\nProcedure for placing the mercy petition before the President:\nCommunication of Rejection of Mercy Petition by the Governor:\nCommunication of Rejection of the Mercy Petition by the President:\nDeath convicts are entitled to a right to receive a copy of the rejection of the mercy petition by the President and the Governor.\nMinimum 14 days\u2019 notice for execution:\nMental Health Evaluation:\nPhysical and Mental Health Reports:\nFurnishing documents to the convict:\nFinal Meeting between the Prisoner and his Family:\nPost Mortem Reports:\nExtra articles related to capital punishment worth reading\nThe journey of a mercy plea \u2013 Indian Express.\nHow does the President decide mercy petitions?\nMercy plea is in the dock \u2013 India Today.\nCapital Punishment \u2013 Wikipedia."

Read further to understand better.\n\n\u201cJudicial Review,\u201d \u201cJudicial Activism,\u201d and \u201cJudicial Overreach\u201d are concepts that pertain to the role and behavior of the judiciary in a legal and political system. These terms are often used in discussions about the extent and limits of judicial power.\n\nLet\u2019s find out the difference between Judicial Review vs Judicial Activism vs Judicial Overreach.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nJudicial Review vs Judicial Activism vs Judicial Overreach\nJudicial Review\nJudicial Activism\nJudicial Overreach\nConclusion\nJudicial Review vs Judicial Activism vs Judicial Overreach\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nJudicial Review:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDefinition: Judicial review is the power of a court, typically a constitutional court, to review the actions, laws, and policies of the legislative and executive branches of government to ensure they conform with the Constitution.\nPurpose: The primary purpose of judicial review is to uphold the rule of law and protect the Constitution. It allows courts to strike down laws or government actions that are unconstitutional, ensuring that government actions remain within the bounds of the Constitution.\n\nJudicial Activism:\n\nDefinition: Judicial activism occurs when a court, typically through its rulings, takes an active and assertive role in shaping social, economic, or political policies. Judges who engage in judicial activism often interpret the Constitution and laws broadly and flexibly to achieve what they consider just outcomes.\nPurpose: Judicial activism is often driven by the belief that the judiciary should play a proactive role in addressing societal issues and injustices. Proponents argue that it can lead to progressive and more equitable outcomes.\n\nJudicial Overreach:\n\nDefinition: Judicial overreach occurs when a court goes beyond its constitutional mandate and interferes excessively in the domains of the legislative or executive branches. It often involves decisions that are seen as overly intrusive or beyond the scope of judicial authority.\nPurpose: Judicial overreach is generally not a purposeful or deliberate action; instead, it is considered a misuse or abuse of judicial power. It may result from judges making decisions that are highly controversial or seen as exceeding their authority.\nJudicial Review\n\nThough the legislature has the power to make laws, this power is not absolute. Judicial Review is the process by which the Judiciary reviews the validity of laws passed by the legislature.\n\n\nFrom where does the power of Judicial Review come: From the Constitution\u00a0of India itself (Article 13).\nThe power of judicial review is evoked to protect and enforce the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution.\nArticle 13 of the Constitution prohibits the Parliament and the state legislatures from making laws that \u201cmay take away or abridge the fundamental rights\u201d guaranteed to the citizens of the country.\nThe provisions of Article 13 ensure the protection of fundamental rights and consider any law \u201cinconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights\u201d as void.\nUnder Article 13, the term \u2018law\u2019 includes any \u201cOrdinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage\u201d having the force of law in India.\nExamples of Judicial Review: The striking down of Section 66A of the IT Act as it was against the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the constitution.\nJudicial Activism\n\nJudicial activism denotes a more active role taken by the Judiciary to dispense social justice. When we speak of Judicial Activism, we point fingers at the invented mechanisms that have no constitutional backing (e.g.: Suo moto (on its own) cases, Public Interest Litigation (PIL), new doctrines, etc.).\n\n\nFrom where does the power of Judicial Activism\u00a0come from:\u00a0Judicial Activism has no constitutional articles to support its origin. Indian Judiciary invented it. There is a similar concept in the United States of America.\nSuo Motto cases and the innovation of the Public Interest Litigation (PIL), with the\u00a0discontinuation of the principle of Locus Standi, \u00a0have allowed the Judiciary to intervene in many public issues, even when there is no complaint from the concerned party.\nAlthough the earlier instances of Judicial Activism were connected with enforcing Fundamental Rights, nowadays, the Judiciary has started interfering in governance issues as well.\nExamples of Judicial Activism:\u00a0Invention of the\u00a0\u2018basic structure\u00a0doctrine\u2019 in the \u2018Keshavanad Bharati case\u2019 (1973) by which Supreme Court further extended the scope of Judicial Review,\u00a0incorporation of\u00a0due process of law instead of procedure established by law, collegium system, institutionalization of PIL, banning smoking in public places based on PIL, the order by Supreme Court in 2001 to provide mid-day meals to schoolchildren, the order passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) banning diesel trucks older than 10 years in Delhi etc.\nJudicial Overreach\n\nThe line between Judicial activism and Judicial Overreach is very narrow. In simple terms, when Judicial activism crosses its limits and becomes Judicial adventurism it is known as Judicial Overreach. When the judiciary oversteps the powers given to it, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the legislative or executive organs of government.\n\n\nFrom where does the power of Judicial\u00a0Overreach\u00a0come from:\u00a0Nowhere. This is undesirable in any democracy.\nJudicial Overreach destroys the spirit of separation of powers.\nExamples of Judicial\u00a0Overreach:\u00a0What makes any action activism or overreach is based upon the\u00a0perspective\u00a0of individuals. But in general, striking down of NJAC bill and the 99th\u00a0constitutional\u00a0amendment, the order passed by the Allahabad High Court\u00a0making it compulsory\u00a0for all Bureaucrats to send their children to government school, misuse the power to punish for contempt of court, etc. are considered as Judicial Overreach.\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the interpretation and application of these concepts can vary depending on the legal and political context of a particular country. What one person may see as judicial activism, another may view as a necessary exercise of judicial review to protect constitutional rights.\n\nSimilarly, the perception of judicial overreach can be subjective and contentious. Balancing the principles of judicial review, activism, and the prevention of overreach is an ongoing debate in legal and political discourse worldwide."

This was rectified only in 2006 by an amendment to the Contempt of Courts Act.\n\nThe\u00a02006 amendment to the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 clarifies that the Court may impose punishment for contempt only when it is satisfied that substantially interferes, or tends to substantially interfere with the due course of justice.\n\nBut this was not followed in the Mid-Day case, where the Delhi high court sentenced employees of the publication for contempt of court for publishing content that portrayed a retired Chief Justice of India unfavourably. Mid-Day raised the defence of truth and good faith but was not entertained.\n\nCourt Cases connected with Contempt of Court in India\nIn Duda P.N. v. Shivshankar, P., the Supreme Court observed that the contempt jurisdiction should not be used by Judges to uphold their own dignity. In the free market places of ideas, criticism about the judicial system or the Judges should be welcomed, so long as criticisms do not impair or hamper the \u201cadministration of justice\u201d.\nIn Auto Shankar\u2019s Case, Jeevan Reddy J, invoked the famous \u201cSullivan doctrine\u201d that public persons must be open to stringent comments and accusations as long as made with bonafide diligence, even if untrue.\nIn Arundhati Roy, In re, the Supreme Court observed that a fair criticism of the conduct of a Judge, the institution of the judiciary and its functioning may not amount to contempt if made in good faith and in public interest.\nIn Indirect Tax practitioners\u2019 Association v. R.K. Jain, S.C. observed that the Court may now permit truth as a defence if two things are satisfied, viz., (i) it is in public interest and (ii) the request for invoking said the defence is bona fide. (S.13, Contempt of Courts Act,1971).\nFreedom of Speech and Expression vs Contempt of Court\n\nArticle 19(1)(a) of the Constitution gives the right of freedom of speech and expression to all citizens.\n\nArticles 129 and 215 give the power of contempt of court to the higher judiciary, and this power limits the freedom granted by Article 19(1)(a).\n\nAs Justice Krishna Iyer said,\u00a0the law of contempt has a vague and wandering jurisdiction with uncertain boundaries. Such a law, regardless of public good, may unwittingly trample upon civil liberties.\n\nFurther, the assumption that respect for the judiciary can be won by shielding judges from criticism misjudges public opinion. Surely an enforced silence, in the name of preserving the dignity of the judiciary, would cause resentment, suspicion and contempt, more than it would enhance respect.\n\nIn a democracy, the people should have the right to criticize judges. The purpose of the contempt power should not be to uphold the majesty and dignity of the court but only to enable it to function.\n\nThe right of the citizens to free speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) should be treated as primary, and the power of contempt should be subordinate.\n\nWhat is the relevance of contempt law in a free society?\n\nThe power to punish for contempt was draconian in nature without commensurate safeguards in favour of the persons charged with the accusation of having committed contempt of court.\n\nSuch a power is\u00a0not in consonance with the constitutional scheme of India.\u00a0The basic principle in a democracy is that the people are supreme. Once this concept of popular sovereignty is kept firmly in mind, it becomes obvious that the people of India are the masters and all authorities (including the courts) are their servants.\n\nIn many countries, contempt jurisdiction is regarded as archaic and exercised sparingly. In the US, courts no longer use contempt to silence comments on judges or legal matters. The First Amendment to the US Constitution forbids imposition of contempt sanctions on a newspaper.\n\nThe concept of criminal contempt in India owing its origin to mid-British times was a corollary of the adage that the king could do no wrong. But this drastic power is\u00a0often used by the judges in an arbitrary manner. (Note: You may read about Judicial Overreach).\n\nIn a free society criticism of the judiciary is inevitable.\n\nJudges have vast powers and people will not remain silent about the exercise of such powers. Just as decisions of other branches of government attract criticism, judicial decisions would also invite the same.\n\nThe test to determine whether an act amounts to contempt of court or not is this: does it make the functioning of the judges impossible or extremely difficult? If it does not, then it does not amount to contempt of court even if it is harsh criticism.\n\nThe law of contempt should be employed only to enable the court to function, not to prevent criticism.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the legislature to take steps to amend the Contempt of Court Act and eschew definition of criminal contempt.\n\nJudiciary should balance two conflicting principles, ie freedom of expression, and fair and fearless justice.\n\nA mature and \u201cbroad-shouldered\u201d approach to criticism can only inspire public confidence, not denigrate the judiciary, for justice, as Lord Atkin said, is \u201cno cloistered virtue\u201d."

New mechanisms (Eg: PIL) and new rights (Eg: RTI)\n\nAs government explicit made legislation for new rights like \u2018Right to Information\u2019 and \u2018Right to Education\u2019, aggrieved parties started to increasingly knock the doors of justice. \u00a0Also, active judiciary has invented new devices like Public Interest Litigation which gave again resulted in more cases.\n\n3.

Also, it most of the cases, when government files a case, it is seen that the government side fails to prove the point.\n\n6. Low judicial quality in lower courts\n\nThe Indian Judicial system has miserably failed to attract the best brains and the talented students.\n\nAs the quality of judges in lower courts is not always up to the mark, appeals are filed against the decisions in higher courts, which again increases the number of cases.\n\nJudges lack specialization and they have turned less efficient and lazy.\n\n7.\u00a0Archaic Laws or Vague Drafting of Laws\n\nThe\u00a0archaic laws that fill up the statute books, faulty or vague drafting of laws and their multiple interpretations by various courts are\u00a0also reasons for prolonged litigation. Some of these laws date back to 1880s. Somebody wants to do something, he is shown a law drafted in the last century and told to stop doing it.\n\nWhy can\u2019t the number of Judges be increased?\n\nSC Chief Justice Thakur lamented \u201cinaction\u201d by the Executive in increasing the number of judges to 40,000 from the current 21,000. \u00a0He blamed the Centre for doing nothing to increase the number of courts and judges in the country. He accused\u00a0Centre of stalling appointment of judges to the High Court.\n\nMore productive days?\n\nIn\u00a02014, former Chief Justice of India, Justice R.M. Lodha, proposed to make Indian judiciary work throughout the year (instead of the present system of having long vacations, especially in the higher courts) in order to reduce pendency of cases in Indian courts.\n\nHowever, as per this proposal, there is not going to be any increase in the number of working days or working hours of any of the judges and it only meant that different judges would be going on vacation during different periods of the year as per their choice.\n\nBut, the Bar Council of India rejected this proposal mainly because it would have inconvenienced the advocates who would have to work throughout the year.\n\nConsequences of Pending Cases in Indian Courts\n\nThe common man\u2019s faith in the justice system is at an all-time low.\nDenies\u00a0the poor man and under trial prisoners their due of justice.\nEconomic reforms remain\u00a0only on paper without speedier justice system.\nForeign\u00a0investors are increasingly doubtful about the timely delivery of justice, which affects the success of programs like \u2018Make in India\u2019.\nJudiciary is unable to handle the \u201cavalanche\u201d of litigation. Judiciary becomes overworked and lose its efficiency. Justice delayed is justice denied and Justice hurried is justice buried.\nSolutions to the\u00a0Problem of Pending Cases in Indian Courts\nThe\u00a0government needs to\u00a0double the\u00a0number of judges and create all India\u00a0Judicial Service.\u00a0The\u00a0number of judges (vacancies) should be immediately raised to at least 50,000 from the current 21,000.\nFix the NJAC controversy at the earliest and start appointing judges in Supreme Court and High Courts.\nMore courts \u2013 Fast Track Courts, Lok Adalats, and Gram Nyayalayas.\n\nReference:\n\nPIB\nLegal Service India\nThe Hindu"

Government litigation reportedly constitutes nearly half of all litigation in the Indian judiciary. In this post let us examine the problem of excessive government litigation and the need for reviewing the National Litigation Policy, 2010.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGovernment litigation constitutes nearly half of all litigation in the Indian judiciary\nIn more than 90% cases, the Government side fails to prove the point!\nNational Litigation Policy (NLP), 2010\nWhy did NLP 2010 fail?\nThe way forward\nReference:\nGovernment litigation constitutes nearly half of all litigation in the Indian judiciary\n\nThere are more than 3 crore cases pending in different courts of India.\nGovernment litigation reportedly constitutes nearly half of all litigation in the Indian judiciary.\nHowever, there are no government sources to confirm the actual quantum of its litigation.\nThe absence of this statistic itself is an indicator of how \u2018interested\u2019 various governments have been in attempting to understand this problem or tackling it meaningfully.\nBesides being a constraint on the public exchequer, government litigation has contributed to judicial backlog, thus affecting justice delivery in India.\nThe Supreme Court, since the 1970s, has berated successive governments for being callous and mechanical in pursuing litigation.\nThe Law Commission of India also studied this problem in its 126th Report in 1988, and made appropriate observations on this front.\nIn 2016, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi broached the problem of excessive government litigation.\nIn more than 90% cases, the Government side fails to prove the point!\n\nMany of the government litigations are actually cases of one department of the government suing another, leaving decision-making to the courts. Also, it most of the other cases, when government files a case, it is seen that the government side fails to prove the point.\n\nNational Litigation Policy (NLP), 2010\n\nThe concept of a national litigation policy has been explored by many countries. The Australian Taxation Office, for example, conducts its litigation in accordance with the PS LA 2009/9 Conduct of Tax Office Litigation, which is an elaborate set of guidelines obligating the government to be a model litigant.\n\nThe Law Minister in the United Progressive Alliance government had launched a \u201cNational Litigation Policy\u201d (NLP) in 2010 to transform the government into a \u201cresponsible and efficient\u201d litigant.\n\nThe policy idealistically states that there should be greater accountability regarding governmental litigation, and mandates \u201csuitable action\u201d against officials violating this policy.\n\nThe NLP 2010 also creates \u201cEmpowered Committees\u201d at the national and regional levels, to regulate the implementation of the policy\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhy did NLP 2010 fail?\n\nThe NLP has failed as an initiative due to ambiguity.\nThe NLP 2010 has no scope for implementation.\nIt is replete with rhetoric and generic phraseology.\nInstead of being an analytical policy document attempting to address the causes of excessive government litigation, it appears to have been drafted on anecdotal notions of the problem, with no measurable outcomes or implementation mechanism.\nThe NLP 2010 fails to provide a yardstick for determining responsibility and efficiency.\nThe text does not define \u201csuitable action\u201d, or prescribe any method to conduct any disciplinary proceedings.\nThere is ambiguity about their role and powers of Empowered Committees, resulting in lack of transparency in their functioning. While these committees are intended to be integral to the accountability mechanisms under the policy, the ambiguity in their roles and functions make them susceptible to a constitutional challenge.\nThe NLP 2010 also lacks any form of impact assessment to evaluate actual impact on reducing government litigation. This absence of a monitoring mechanism is evident from the fact that there is no data available even today to accurately verify the extent of government litigation in India. Without such evaluation, this litigation policy remains a theoretical, ambiguous and fairly inadequate document on the pretext of policy reform.\nThe way forward\n\nIn 2015, after the National Democratic Alliance came to power, there was a discussion to review the NLP. This is yet to culminate in a revised NLP.\n\nThe bureaucracy needs to be\u00a0sufficiently motivated to tackle the issue.\n\nFinally, the ongoing revision of the NLP needs to ensure certain critical features are not missed out:\n\nIt must have clear objectives that can be assessed;\nThe role of different functionaries must be enumerated;\nThe minimum standards for pursuing litigation must be listed out;\nFair accountability mechanisms must be established;\nThe consequences for violation of the policy must be provided;\nA\u00a0periodic impact assessment programme must be factored in.\nREFERENCE:\nThe Hindu\nWikipedia"

The reason behind the same can be noted in the negatives of arbitration systems in the next section.\n\nWhat are the types of arbitration in India?\n\nThere are two types of arbitration in India: Ad-hoc arbitration and Institutional arbitration.\n\nAd-hoc arbitration\n\nAd-hoc Arbitration can be defined as a procedure of arbitration where a tribunal will conduct arbitration between the parties, following the rules which have been agreed by the parties beforehand or by following the rules which have been laid down by the tribunal, in case the parties do not have any agreement between them.\n\nPOSITIVES OF AD-HOC ARBITRATION\n\t\nNEGATIVES OF AD-HOC ARBITRATION\n\n\nGreater control over the arbitration process\nThe flexibility to decide the procedure\nCost-effectiveness, where the administration charges levied by an arbitral institution constitute a significant portion of the overall costs\n\t\nTend to be protracted and costly in some cases in the absence of monitoring\nOnly effective when both parties are ready to cooperate with each other\nInstitutional arbitration\n\nInstitutional arbitration refers to the administration of arbitration by an institution in accordance with its rules of procedure. The institution provides appointment of arbitrators, case management services including oversight of the arbitral process, venues for holding hearings, etc.\n\nPresently there are over 35 arbitral institutions in India, which are domestic, international arbitral institutions, arbitration facilities by PSUs, trade and merchant associations, and city-specific chambers of commerce and industry. Many have their own rules and some follow the arbitration rules of the UNCITRAL.\n\nIndian institutions that administer arbitrations have an increasing popularity but insufficient workload. Many arbitrations involving Indian parties are administered by the international arbitral institutions such as the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cICC Court\u201d), the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\u201cSIAC\u201d) and the London Court of International Arbitration (\u201cLCIA\u201d),\n\nPOSITIVES OF INSTITUTIONAL ARBITRATION\n\t\nNEGATIVES OF INSTITUTIONAL ARBITRATION\n\n\nA clear set of arbitration rules\nTimeline for the conduct of an arbitration\nSupport from trained staff\nA panel of arbitrators to choose from\nSupervision in the form of scrutiny of awards\nIf the parties are not sophisticated and do not have sufficient knowledge regarding arbitral proceedings, institutional arbitration is preferable\nResolve disputes efficiently and follow guidelines when conducting arbitrations\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\nLack of credible arbitral institutions\nMisconceptions relating to institutional arbitration related to costs\nLack of governmental support for institutional arbitration\nLack of legislative support for institutional arbitration\nJudicial attitudes towards arbitration in general.\nThe rules and practices followed are often outdated and inadequate\nFails to upgrade their administrative and working style as only provide hearing venues with basic facilities and lack more advanced facilities such as multi-screen video conferencing, sound-proof caucus rooms, audio/video recording, court recorders, etc.\nInflexible as it\u00a0takes away the exclusive autonomy of the parties over arbitration proceedings\nDelays in Indian courts and excessive judicial involvement in arbitral proceedings contributed to discouraging foreign parties to arbitrate in India.\nParties often delay arbitration proceedings by initiating court proceedings before or during arbitral proceedings, or at the enforcement stage of the arbitral award.\nWhat are the challenges of institutional arbitration in India?\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned negatives of\u00a0 Institutional arbitration, following are the challenges of the institutional arbitration in India.\n\nIssues relating to administration and management of arbitral institutions.\nPerceptions regarding arbitrators and expertise issues relating to resources and government support, lack of initial capital, poor and inadequate infrastructure, lack of properly trained administrative staff, lack of qualified arbitrators, etc.\nIssues in developing India as an international arbitration seat.\n\nTo address the challenges and shortcoming of the Institutional arbitration, a High-Level Committee (HLC) to Review the Institutionalisation of Arbitration Mechanism in India under Mr Justice B N Srikrishna was constituted in 2016.\u00a0The committee submitted its report on 3 August 2017.\n\nRecommendations of B N Srikrishna Committee\n\nIN RELATION TO INSTITUTIONAL ARBITRATION LANDSCAPE IN INDIA\nSet up an autonomous body, styled the Arbitration Promotion Council of India (APCI), having representatives from all stakeholders for grading arbitral institutions in India.\nThe APCI may\nrecognize professional institutes providing for accreditation of arbitrators.\nhold training workshops and interact with law firms and law schools to train advocates with interest in arbitration.\ncreate a specialist arbitration bar comprising of advocates dedicated to the field.\nA good arbitration bar could help in the speedy and efficient conduct of arbitral proceedings.\nCreation of a specialist Arbitration Bench to deal with such commercial disputes, in the domain of the Courts.\nChanges suggested in various provisions of the 2015 Amendments of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act with a view to making arbitration speedier and more efficacious and incorporate international best practices (immunity to arbitrators, confidentiality of arbitral proceedings, etc.).\nThe Committee is also of the opinion that the National Litigation Policy (NLP) must promote arbitration in government contracts.\nGovernment\u2019s role: The Central Government and various state governments may stipulate in arbitration clauses/agreements in government contracts that only arbitrators accredited by any such recognised professional institute may be appointed as arbitrators under such arbitration clauses/agreements.\nWORKING AND PERFORMANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ICADR)\nInternational Centre for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ICADR) was established in 1995 for the promotion and development of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) facilities and techniques to facilitate early resolution of disputes and to reduce the increasing burden of arrears in Courts. (For more details, refer: ICADR)\nThe committee recommended declaring the ICADR as an Institution of national importance and takeover of the institution by a statute as revamped ICADR has the potential be a globally competitive institution.\n\nThe reasons for choosing ICADR as the arbitral institution to be\u00a0developed are:\n\nIt was set up in 1995 (under the aegis of the Ministry of Law and Justice) with the object of promoting ADR in India.\nIt has received substantial funding by way of grants and other benefits from the Government.\nIt has some\u00a0benefits like an excellent location (Headquarters at New Delhi and Regional Centres at Hyderabad and Bangalore), good infrastructure and facilities which make it ideal for development as an arbitral institution.\nBilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) arbitrations involving the Union of India\n\nIndia presently involved in 20-odd BIT disputes. The committee recommendations on Bilateral Investment Treaty Arbitrations are:\n\nCreate an Inter-Ministerial Committee\u00a0(IMC) constituting officials from Ministries of finance, external affairs and law.\nHire external lawyers having expertise in BIT.\nDesignated fund to fight BIT claims.\nAppoint counsels having BIT expertise.\nBoosting capacity of central and state governments to better understand the implications of their policy decisions on India\u2019s BIT obligation.\nCreate a post of international law adviser \u2013 responsible for day-to-day management of BIT arbitration.\nConsider the possibility of establishing a BIT appellate mechanism and a multilateral investment court.\nInvestor- state dispute settlement mechanism as given in article 15 of the Indian model BIT is an effective mechanism.\n\nThe committee\u2019s recommendation for the creation of the new post of legal advisor and treaty\u2019s division of External Affairs Ministry mandated to offer advice to government on all international law matters may increase red-tapism and turf wars between ministries. The committee focuses only on procedural aspect of BIT arbitration ignores jurisdictional and substantive (provision on expropriation) aspects. The critical issues such as the appointment of arbitrators, transparency provisions, enforcement of awards, the standard of review, etc were also overlooked by the committee.\n\nAlong with these, there can be more improvements like:\n\nLegal and Treaties division could be designated to deal with all BIT arbitrations \u2013 coordinator of the proposed IMC.\nCommerce Ministry should also be included in IMC.\nConclusion\n\nThese reforms aim to make India an international hub of arbitration and a Centre of robust ADR mechanism catering to international and domestic arbitration, at par with international standards. Also, reducing the workload of the judicial system, arbitration mechanism will ensure that justice is attained by all at shortest time span possible.\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Sangeeta Dhiman"

They are normally deployed for cases involving a smaller number of definite issues that require prompt action.\n\nThe judgments and orders passed by Gram Nyayalayas are deemed to be a decree.\n\nGram Nyayalayas are not be bound by the rules of evidence provided in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 but shall be guided by the principles of natural justice and subject to any rule made by the High Court.\n\nAppeal\n\nThe appeal in criminal cases shall lie to the Court of Session, which shall be heard and disposed of within a period of six months from the date of filing of such appeal.\n\nThe appeal in civil cases shall lie to the District Court, which shall be heard and disposed of within a period of six months from the date of filing of the appeal.\n\nA person accused of an offence may file an application for plea bargaining.\n\nAlso read: Women in Judiciary\n\nNeed for Gram Nyayalayas\n\nAccess to justice for the poor and marginalized remains a perennial problem in India.\n\nVarious measures such as simplifying procedural laws, establishing alternate dispute redressal mechanisms, setting up fast track courts and providing free legal aid to the poor are undertaken in this regard.\n\nDespite these measures, access to justice and faster, inexpensive settlement of disputes at the grass-roots level are yet to materialize.\n\nGram Nyayalayas can greatly help in\n\ndevolving justice delivery to the fourth tier\nensuring equal access to justice\nreducing the burden of district courts\ndelivering speedier justice\nreducing the costs associated with litigation for the common man\nreducing dependency on extra-constitutional forums of justice\nWhy Gram Nyayalayas are not operational?\nLack of infrastructure like buildings, office spaces and related equipment\nLack of man-power resources, notaries, stamp vendors etc. at sub-district level\nInadequate Central assistance\nLack of awareness among lawyers, police officials\nNon-cooperation of enforcement agencies\nThe reluctance of state functionaries to invoke the jurisdiction of Gram Nyayalayas\nSetting up of legal services institutions at Taluk level reducing the dependency on Gram Nyayalayas\nCriticisms on Gram Nyayalayas\nThe number of disputes settled by Gram Nyayalayas are negligible and most are referred to District forums by appeal.

The Act aims at making justice easily accessible to the rural population and dealing with the backlog of cases. The Act also makes the judicial process\u00a0participatory and decentralised\u00a0because it allows appointment of local\u00a0social activists and lawyers as mediators/reconciliators. To make the judiciary responsive to the local socio-economic situation, it prescribes representation from scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. There is also a provision of setting up mobile courts at the panchayat level. As per the Act, Gram Nyayalayas can hear both criminal and civil cases and appeals in civil cases\u00a0will have to be disposed of in six months.\n\nNote: Click here to practise UPSC Civil Services Examination Previous Year Question Papers in a timed-environment.

Procedure Established by Law and Due Process of Law.\n\n\u201cProcedure Established by Law\u201d and \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d are two legal principles that relate to the protection of individual rights and the application of law in legal proceedings. While these principles may seem similar, they have distinct implications and are used in different legal systems around the world.\n\nThe former is Indian constitutional doctrine and the latter is American, but now the boundaries are very narrow.\n\nLet\u2019s start our discussion with Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. What does it say?\n\nAlso read: Sealed Cover Jurisprudence\n\nTable of Contents\n\nArticle 21 in The Constitution Of India\nProcedure Established by Law vs Due Process of Law\nCase 1: Procedure Established by Law\nCase 2: Due Process of Law\nExtra Articles worth reading\nHistory of Due Process of Law\nProcedure established by law: Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India case (1978)\nConclusion\nArticle 21 in The Constitution Of India\n\nProtection of life and personal liberty: \u00a0No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nArticle 21 of the Indian Constitution uses the term \u201cProcedure Established by Law,\u201d which means that no person shall be deprived of their life or personal liberty except according to a procedure established by law.\n\nThis implies that if the government follows the prescribed legal procedures while depriving a person of their life or liberty, it is constitutionally valid, irrespective of whether the procedure is fair, just, or reasonable.\n\nProcedure Established by Law vs Due Process of Law\n\nAs we have seen,\u00a0the term \u201cprocedure established by law\u201d is used directly in the Indian constitution. Due Process of Law has much wider significance, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution. The due process doctrine is followed in the United States of America, and Indian constitutional framers purposefully left that out. But in most of the recent judgments of the supreme court, the due process aspect is coming into the picture again. Let\u2019s see the difference in detail.\n\nCase 1: Procedure Established by Law\n\n\u201cProcedure Established by Law\u201d is a principle that is primarily associated with legal systems based on common law, including India. In countries following this principle, the government enacts laws, and individuals must comply with those laws.\n\nThe government has the authority to set the procedures and processes for implementing and enforcing these laws. Under this principle, as long as the government follows the procedures it has established, its actions are considered valid, even if they may appear unfair or unjust to individuals.\n\nIt means that a law that is duly enacted by the legislature or the concerned body is valid if it has followed the correct procedure. Following this doctrine means that, a person can be deprived of his life or personal liberty according to the\u00a0procedure established by law.\n\nSo, if Parliament passes a law, then the life or personal liberty of a person can be taken off according to the provisions and procedures of that law.\n\nThis doctrine has a major flaw. What is it?\n\nIt does not seek whether the laws made by Parliament are fair, just, and not arbitrary.\n\n\u201cProcedure established by law\u201d means a law duly enacted is valid even if it\u2019s contrary to principles of justice and equity. The strict following of the procedure established by law may raise the risk of compromise to the life and personal liberty of individuals due to unjust laws made by the law-making authorities. It is to avoid this situation, SC stressed the importance of the due process of law.\n\nCase 2: Due Process of Law\n\nDue process of law doctrine not only checks if there is a law to deprive the life and personal liberty of a person but also sees if the law made is fair, just, and not arbitrary.\n\nIf SC finds that any law is not fair, it will declare it null and void. This doctrine provides for a more fair treatment of individual rights.\n\nUnder due process, it is the legal requirement that the state must respect all of the legal rights that are owed to a person, and laws that the state enacts must conform to the laws of the land like \u2013 fairness, fundamental rights, liberty, etc. It also gives the judiciary to access fundamental fairness, justice, and liberty of any legislation.\n\n\u201cDue Process of Law\u201d is a legal principle commonly found in legal systems based on the common law tradition, particularly in countries like the United States.\n\nUnder this principle, the government must follow fair and just procedures before depriving an individual of life, liberty, or property. Due process ensures that individuals have the right to be heard, to present evidence, and to be treated fairly before any government action is taken against them.\n\nThe difference in layman\u2019s terms is as below:\u00a0Due Process of Law = Procedure Established by Law + The procedure should be fair and just and not arbitrary.\n\nAlso read: Must Know Articles of Indian Constitution\n\nExtra Articles worth reading\nOf constitutional \u2018due process\u2019: The Hindu \u2013 Are we shifting from original constitutional norms?\nOn MCOCA: Tehelka \u2013\u00a0A Law Inconsistent With The Idea Of India.\nDue Process of law: Manupatra.\nHistory of Due Process of Law\n\nDue process developed from clause 39 of the Magna Carta in England. When English and American law gradually diverged, due process was not upheld in England but did become incorporated into the Constitution of the United States.\n\nUnlike \u201cProcedure Established by Law,\u201d \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d requires the government to respect certain fundamental rights and treat individuals fairly and impartially. It places a higher emphasis on individual rights and procedural safeguards.\n\nIn the United States, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution include the Due Process Clause, which prohibits the government from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\n\nProcedure established by law: Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India case (1978)\n\nIn India, a liberal interpretation is made by the judiciary after 1978 and it has tried to make the term \u2018Procedure established by law\u2019 synonymous with \u2018Due process\u2019 when it comes to protecting individual rights.\n\nIn the Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India case (1978) SC held that \u2013 the\u00a0\u2018procedure established by law\u2019 within the meaning of Article 21 must be \u2018right and just and fair\u2019 and \u2018not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive\u2019 otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied. Thus, the \u2018procedure established by law\u2019 has acquired the same significance in India as the \u2018due process of law clause in America.\n\nConclusion\n\n\u201cProcedure Established by Law\u201d focuses on the formal adherence to legal procedures set by the government, while \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d emphasizes the protection of individual rights and fairness in the application of law and legal proceedings.\n\nThe choice between these principles has significant implications for the protection of individual rights in a legal system."

            "[CONTENT]": "When there is a conflict between Fundamental Rights(FR) and Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), which should prevail? FR? or DPSP?\n\nThe answer is not as simple as one would think.\n\nThere are some important Supreme Court judgements regarding this. We shall see them in detail.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhen there is a conflict between Fundamental Rights and DPSPs, which should prevail?\nCase 1: Kerala Education Bill (1957): Doctrine of Harmonious Construction\nCase 2:\u00a0Champakam Dorairajan Case (1952)\nCase 3:\u00a0Golak Nath Case (1967)\nCase 4:\u00a0Kesavanath Bharathi Case (1973)\nCase 5:\u00a0Minerva Mill Case (1980)\nPresent Order\u00a0of Precedence\nWhat is Article 39(b)?\nWhat is Article 39(c)?\nSummary of the History of Conflict: Supreme Court vs Parliament\nWhen there is a conflict between Fundamental Rights and DPSPs, which should prevail?\n\nDPSPs are not enforceable by law, but just directives to the state. But when the state tries to implement a DPSP, there can be a conflict between the Fundamental Rights of citizens and DPSP.\n\nIn that sense, the conflict between the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) can also be seen as the conflict between the individual and the state.\n\nWhile Parliament often tried to assert the supremacy of the state and DPSPs over Fundamental Rights, the Supreme Court upheld the rights of the individual as enshrined in the Constitution, by giving appropriate judgments.\n\nLet us study the highlights of a series of court judgments like Champakam Dorairajan Case (1952), Golak Nath Case (1967), Kesavanath Bharathi Case (1973), Minerva Mill Case (1980) etc and see the present status.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCase 1: Kerala Education Bill (1957): Doctrine of Harmonious Construction\n\nSupreme Court in the Re Kerala Education Bill(1957) had propounded the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction to avoid a situation of conflict while enforcing DPSPs and the Fundamental Rights. As per this doctrine, the court held that there is no inherent conflict between FRs and DPSPs and the courts while interpreting a law should attempt to give effect to both as far as possible i. e. should try to harmonize the two as far as possible.\n\nThe court further said that where two interpretation of the law is possible, and one interpretation validates the law while other interpretation makes the law unconstitutional and void, then the first interpretation which validates the law should be adopted. But if only one interpretation is possible which leads to conflict between DPSPs and FRs, the court has no option but to implement FRs in preference to DPSPs.\n\nCase 2:\u00a0Champakam Dorairajan Case (1952)\n\nCourt Verdict: All Fundamental Rights are superior over DPSP.\n\nParliament Reaction:\u00a0The parliament responded by amending and modifying various FRs which were coming in conflict with DPSPs.\n\nCase 3:\u00a0Golak Nath Case (1967)\n\nCourt Verdict: \u00a0Fundamental Rights cannot be abridged or diluted.\n\nParliament Reaction: The parliament responded again by bringing the 25th Amendment Act of the constitution which inserted Article 31C in Part III. Article 31 C contained two provisions:\n\na. If a law is made to give effect to DPSPs in Article 39(b) and Article 39(c) and in the process, the law violates Article 14, Article 19 or Article 31, then the law should not be declared as unconstitutional and void merely on this ground.\n\nb. Any such law which contains the declaration that it is to give effect to DPSPs in Article 39(b) and\u00a0Article(c) shall not be questioned in a court of law.\n\nCase 4:\u00a0Kesavanath Bharathi Case (1973)\n\nThe above amendment was challenged in the Kesavananda Bharati Case(1973).\n\nCourt Verdict: Parliament can amend any part of Constitution, but could not destroy Basic Structure of the Constitution. The second clause of Article 31C was as declared as unconstitutional and void as it was against the Basic Structure of the Constitution propounded in this case itself. However, the SC upheld the first provision of Article 31C. The court also held that the power of Judicial review cannot be taken out by Parliament.\n\nParliament Reaction:\u00a0Parliament brought the 42nd Amendment Act in 1976, which extended the scope of the above first provision of Article 31C by including within its purview any law to implement any of the DPSPs specified in Part IV of the constitutional and not merely Article 39 (b) or (c).\n\nCase 5:\u00a0Minerva Mill Case (1980)\n\nCourt Verdict: A law under Article 31C would be protected only if it is made to implement directives in article 39b and 39 c and not any other DPSPs.\u00a0The\u00a0extension to all DPSPs was declared as unconstitutional and void by the SC in the Minerva Mills Case(1980).\n\nPresent Order\u00a0of Precedence\n\nSo, if there is a conflict between FR and DPSP, which should prevail? The present order of precedence is as below:\n\nFR except 14 and 19.\nDPSP 39(b) and 39(c).\nFR 14 and 19.\nDPSP except 39(b) and 39(c).\n\nThis means that DPSP 39B and 39C has been given precedence over Fundamental Right 14 (Right to Equality) and Fundamental Right 19 (Freedom of Speech and Expression).\n\nAlso, read\u00a0Indian Polity Notes Which You Shouldn\u2019t Miss!\n\nWhat is Article 39(b)?\n\nThe State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing: that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good.\n\nWhat is Article 39(c)?\n\nThe State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing: that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment.\n\nSummary of the History of Conflict: Supreme Court vs Parliament\n\nThe Supreme Court in the Champakam Dorairajan Vs State of Madras(1951) held that DPSPs cannot override the provisions of Part III of the constitution. As per the judgment, the DPSPs have to run subsidiary to the FRs and have to confirm them.\n\nThe parliament responded by amending and modifying various FRs which were coming in conflict with DPSPs. The Supreme court, however, in the Golknath Case(1967) pronounced that parliament cannot amend the FRs to give effect to the DPSPs. The parliament responded again by bringing the 25th Amendment Act of the constitution which inserted Article 31C in Part III. Article 31 C contained two provisions:\n\na. If a law is made to give effect to DPSPs in Article 39(b) and Article 39(c) and in the process, the law violates Article 14, Article 19 or Article 31, then the law should not be declared as unconstitutional and void merely on this ground.\n\nb. Any such law which contains the declaration that it is to give effect to DPSPs in Article 39(b) & Article(c) shall not be questioned in a court of law.\n\nLater parliament brought the 42nd Amendment Act in 1976, which extended the scope of the above first provision of Article 31C by including within its purview any law to implement any of the DPSPs specified in Part IV of the constitutional and not merely Article 39(b) or (c). However, this extension was declared as unconstitutional and void by the SC in the Minerva Mills Case(1980).\n\nThe present position is that only Article 39 (b) and Article 39 (c) can be given precedence over Article 14, 19 and not all the Directive Principles."

However, after the 103rd constitutional amendment in 2019, economic backwardness is also considered.\n\nApart from the reservation quota, additional relaxations like upper-age relaxations, additional attempts, and lower cut-off marks are also provided for various reservation categories.\n\nReservation quota in India for Government Jobs\nReservation quota in India for Government Jobs and Higher Educational Institutions\n\nA vacancy reserved for SCs STs or OBCs cannot be filled by a candidate other than an SC ST or OBC candidate, as the case may be.\n\nAs seen from the above table, about 60% of seats are reserved in India \u2013\u00a0 for various sections like ST, SC, OBC, and EWS \u2013\u00a0with respect to Government jobs and Higher Education Institutions. 3% of seats are also reserved for differently-abled persons across all categories.\n\nThis also means that only 40% of seats are available under merit. In the merit seats,\u00a0not only the general category candidates but all other categories like SC, ST, OBC, and EWS can also compete.\n\nSC/ST Reservation\n\nThe objective of providing reservations to the Scheduled Castes(SCs), and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in services is not only to give jobs to some persons belonging to these communities. It basically aims at empowering them and ensuring their participation in the decision-making process of the State.\n\nBesides, the state is also keen to end practices such as untouchability.\n\nScheduled Castes (SC) are given a 15% quota in jobs/higher educational institutions while Schedule Tribes (ST) are given a 7.5% quota in jobs/higher educational institutions.\n\nReservation is provided not only with respect to direct recruitment but also with respect to promotions for the SC/ST category (Article 16(4A)).\n\nThere is no concept of a \u2018creamy layer\u2019 with respect to SC/ST reservation. This means that irrespective of the income status or the government posts held by the parents, children of SC/ST parents will get SC/ST Reservations.\n\nOBC Reservation\n\nReservation for Other Backwards Classes (OBC) was introduced based on the Mandal Commission Report (1991). The quota for OBCs is 27% in government jobs and higher educational institutions.\n\nHowever, there is a concept of a \u2018creamy layer\u2019 with respect to the OBC reservation. Only those from OBC who come under the Non-Creamy Layer would get an OBC reservation.\n\nThe creamy layer concept brings income and social status as parameters to exclude some of the privileged members of OBC from the extent of reservation. This concept also keeps a check to ensure that the benefits of reservation do not get extended to subsequent generations.\n\nRead more about the OBC Reservation Eligibility.\n\nEWS Reservation\n\nThe Central Government of India recently introduced EWS Reservation. A 10% quota is provided for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS)\u00a0among General Category candidates in government jobs and educational institutions. This is done by adding clauses for the same in the Indian\u00a0Constitution (103rd Constitution Amendment Act, 2019).\n\nRead more about the EWS Reservation Eligibility\n\nHistory of Reservation System in India \u2013 Rectifying the Historical Injustice\n\nTo an extent, reservation as a policy is pursued by the State to correct the historical injustice done to certain castes by the so-called \u201cupper castes\u201d. The caste system that prevailed in India had alienated many \u201clower castes\u201d from the mainstream \u2013 hindering their development. To a great extent, the repercussions are still felt.\n\nThe original Consitution of India provided reservation only for quota in legislatures \u2013 that too only for 10 years until 1960 (article 334). Subsequent amendments to the constitution extended the period of reservation for quota in legislatures.\n\nProvisions of reservations in Educational Institutions and Government Jobs \u2013 article 15(4) and Article 16 (4) \u2013 were also created by means of Constitutional Amendments later. No time period is given for the validity of the reservations mentioned in Article 15(4) and Article 16(4).\n\nThe initial reservations were only for SC and ST [Article 15(4) and Article 16(4)]. OBCs were included in the ambit of reservation in 1991 [Article 15(5)]. In 2019, Economically Weaker Sections are also included [Article 15(6) and Article 16(6)].\n\nAlso read: Maratha quota law\n\nShould India need reservations (now)?\n\nIt\u2019s the duty of the government to provide\u00a0equality of status and opportunity in India.\n\nReservation is one of the tools against social oppression and injustice against certain classes. Otherwise known as affirmative action, reservation helps in uplifting backward classes.\n\nHowever, reservation is just one of the methods for social upliftment. There are many other methods like providing scholarships, funds, coaching, and other welfare schemes.\n\nThe way the reservation is implemented and executed in India is largely governed by vote-bank politics.\n\nIndian Consitution\u00a0allowed reservation only for\u00a0socially and educationally backward classes. However, in India, it became a caste-based reservation instead of a\u00a0class-based reservation.\n\nInitially, the reservation was intended only for SC/ST communities \u2013 that too for a period of 10 years (1951-1961). However, it has extended ever since. After the implementation of the Mandal Commission report in 1990, the scope of the reservation was widened to include Other Backward Communities (OBCs).\n\nThe benefits of the reservation were successively enjoyed only by a few communities (or families), excluding the truly deserving ones. Even 70 years after independence, the demand for reservations has only increased.\n\nNow, with the introduction of economic criteria for reservation, in addition to the caste criteria that already existed, things have become more complicated.\n\nUnequals should not be treated equally, but is reservation the only solution?\n\nThere is no doubt that unequal people should not be treated equally. However, is the current system of unequal treatment perfect? Is it creating more injustice? Is it the only way out in a welfare nation? It\u2019s time to introspect.\n\nReservation based entirely on economic criteria is not an all-in-one solution, though family income can be one of the parameters. Also, it\u2019s time to fix a time period for the reservation system \u2013 rather than extending it to eternity.\n\nDenying India, the service of the\u00a0meritorious candidates, who see them being overtaken by others with lesser academic performance or brilliance, is also a crime and injustice.\n\nAren\u2019t there any alternative mechanisms to uplift the marginalized so that everyone gets equal opportunities? How is affirmative action done in other countries?\n\nReforms in the reservation system of India are the need of the hour. However, as the subject of reservation revolves around a lot of votes, parties are reluctant to disrupt the existing system.\n\n50% Cap on Caste-Based Reservations\n\nIn Indra Sawhney vs Union Of India, 1992, the Supreme Court of India capped caste-based reservation, ruling that \u201cno provision of reservation or preference can be so vigorously pursued as to destroy the very concept of equality\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince this Court has consistently held that the reservation under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) should not exceed 50% and the States and the Union have by and large accepted this as correct it should be held as constitutional prohibition and any reservation beyond 50% would liable to be struck down.\u201d\n\nWhile introducing the bill for Economic Reservation in 2019, Arun Jaitley (Finance Minister) contended that the 50% cap on reservations imposed by the Supreme Court was only\u00a0for caste-based reservations, and the\u00a0Economically Weaker Section (EWS) reservation\u00a0won\u2019t be impacted by it.\n\nPoverty cannot be the basis for providing reservations: SC\n\nAs per Article 16(4), one of the main purposes of the reservation is to provide adequate representation of all classes (castes) in government services. Economic Reservation introduced by Article 16(6) is actually against this concept \u2013 as it does not take into consideration the caste-based representation.\n\nMoreover, the reservation is not a poverty alleviation scheme.\n\nSupreme Court had also ruled that economic status cannot be the sole criterion for reservation.\n\nMany states had tried to implement Economic Reservation, however, they were subsequently quashed by Courts.\n\nIntroducing the EWS bill in 2019, Union Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thaawarchand Gehlot said the similar state laws for the EWS quota were quashed by Courts because there was no provision for economic reservation in the Constitution before.\u00a0 Now, the Law will not be struck down by the Supreme Court if challenged as it has been brought by making required provisions in the Constitution.\n\nWill the Reservation System in India compromise the Merit (and efficiency of the system)?\n\nArticle 335 of the Indian Constitution states that\n\nThe claims of the member of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be\ntaken into consideration, consistently, with the maintenance of efficiency of administration in\nthe making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union\nor of a State.\n\nProvided that nothing in this article shall prevent in the making of any provision in\nfavour of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes for relaxation in\nqualifying marks in any examination or lowering the standards of evaluation, for reservation in\nmatters of promotion to any class or classes of services or posts in connection with the affairs\nof the Union or of a State.\n\nThere is no second question that all castes/classes should be adequately represented in government services. However, which percentage can be called adequate \u2013 without compromising the merit or efficiency of the administration?\n\nIs the current level of reservation adequate? Or is it less? Or has it already compromised the merit? What do you think?\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nQ. What is the reservation percentage in India?\n\nAns: In India, reservation to the SCs, STs and OBCs in case of direct recruitment on an India basis by open competition is given at the rate of 15%, 7.5% and 27%\u00a0respectively.\n\nQ. How many reservations are there in India?\n\nAns: Reservation in India is provided to Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) at the rate of 15%, 7.5% and 27%, respectively, in case of direct recruitment on all India basis by open competition.\n\nQ. Who created reservations in India?\n\nAns: \u00a0William Hunter and Jyotirao Phule in 1882 originally conceived the idea of the caste-based reservation system. The reservation system that exists today, in its true sense, was introduced in 1933 when British Prime Minister Ramsay Macdonald presented the \u2018Communal Award\u2019. After long negotiations, Gandhi and Ambedkar signed the \u2018Poona Pact\u2019,\u00a0where it was decided that there would be a single Hindu electorate with certain reservations in it.\n\nRead:\u00a0\n\nMaratha Quota Law\nLocal reservation in private sector\nSub-classification of SCs and STs"

Very often, the accused are not convicted due to lack of evidence.\n\nMany see encounter killings are a means of ensuring speedy justice.\n\nEncounter Killings \u2013 The problem\n\nWhat if those who are killed by encounters are innocent?\n\nWhat if the authorities start to misuse their power?\n\nWhat if the killings eliminate any further proof of other persons involved?\n\nThe rule of law is the fundamental principle of governance of any civilized liberal democracy. It avoids any sort of arbitrariness.\n\nHistory of Extra-Judicial Killings in India\n\nThere were attempts in many states to govern through \u201crule by law\u201d and oppose the \u201crule of law\u201d. In this case,\u00a0 the police had assumed the role of both investigator and judge.\n\nThere were many reports of encounter killings in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal.\n\nRecently, two states notorious for extrajudicial killings are Manipur and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIs Encounter Killing an offense?\n\nThe only two circumstances in which such killing would not constitute an offense are\n\nif death is caused in the exercise of the right of private defense.\nif it is necessary to arrest the person accused of an offense punishable with death or imprisonment for life \u2013 under Section 46 of the CrPC, which authorizes the police to use force, extending up to the causing of death, as may be.\nExtrajudicial Killing for Self Defence vs. Extra Judicial Killing as Retaliation\n\nThe apex court, when dealing with a PIL on alleged 1528 extra-judicial killings in Manipur from 2000 to 2012 by Armed Forces said:\n\nA distinction must be drawn between the right of self-defence or private defence and use of excessive force or retaliation.\n\nVery simply put, the right of self-defence or private defence is a right that can be exercised to defend oneself but not to retaliate.\n\nWhat if the Encounter Killings are fake?\n\nThere can be cases when the encounter killings are pre-planned. Many encounter killings generally take place with the prior consent or in full knowledge of the top authority. It may not be an act of self-defense or retaliation \u2013 but just pre-planned murder by police authorities.\n\nHow should the death at police hands be investigated: The 16-point guideline by the Supreme Court of India\n\nThe Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice R.M. Lodha and Justice Rohinton F. Nariman 2014 outlined a 16-point guideline to follow in cases of death or grievous injury in police encounters.\n\nAs per the Supreme Court of India, every death at police hands must be recorded and investigated by an independent agency or a police unit not involved in the case.\n\nThe guidelines, in brief, are as follows:\nTip-offs about criminal activities must be recorded either in writing or in electronic form.\nIf pursuant to a tip-off the police use firearms and this results in the death of a person, then an FIR initiating a proper criminal investigation must be registered.\nThe investigation into such death will be done by an independent CID team which has to fulfil eight minimum investigation requirements.\nA mandatory magisterial inquiry into all cases of encounter deaths.\nThe NHRC or State Commission must be immediately informed of the encounter death.\nMedical aid to the injured victim/criminal and a magistrate should record his statement.\nEnsure forwarding FIR and police diary entries to court without delay.\nExpeditious and proper trial.\nInforming next of kin of the dead alleged criminal.\nBi-annual statements of all encounter killings are to be sent to the NHRC and state commissions by a set date in a set format.\nDisciplinary action against and suspension of a police officer if found guilty of wrongful encounter.\nCompensation scheme under the CrPC to be followed for awarding it to the kin of the dead victim.\nPolice officers must surrender their weapons for investigation, subject to rights under Article 20 of the Constitution.\nIntimate the family of the accused police officer and offer the services of a lawyer/counselor.\nNo out-of-turn gallantry awards for the officers involved in encounter killings.\nThe family of the victim can complain to the Sessions judge if it feels that these guidelines have not been followed. The judge will take cognizance.\nNote: The case originated with a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by the People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) before the Bombay High Court, which later came to the apex court in appeal. PUCL had challenged the genuineness of at least 99 so-called encounters \u2014 staged killings \u2014 between the Mumbai Police and alleged criminals resulting in their deaths between 1995 and 1997.\nConclusion\n\nUnless it is for self-defense, all extra-judicial killings are otherwise unacceptable in a society of law.\n\n\u2018The rule by gun\u2019 should not be preferred to \u2018the rule of law\u2019. The fundamental premise of the rule of law is that every human being, including the worst criminal, is entitled to basic human rights and due process.\n\nWe must recall what the Supreme Court said in the Salwa Judum case (2011):\n\nThe primordial value is that it is the responsibility of every organ of the State to function within the four corners of constitutional responsibility. That is the ultimate rule of law.\n\nThe need of the hour is to rebuild the lost trust in the justice delivery mechanism in the country and fast-track the process."

The text of Article 35A is given below.\n\n\u201cSaving of laws with respect to permanent residents and their rights. \u2014 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Constitution, no existing law in force in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and no law hereafter enacted by the Legislature of the State:\n\n(a) defining the classes of persons who are, or shall be, permanent residents of the State of Jammu and Kashmir; or\n\n(b) conferring on such permanent residents any special rights and privileges or imposing upon other persons any restrictions as respects\u2014\n\n(i) employment under the State Government;\n(ii) acquisition of immovable property in the State;\n(iii) settlement in the State; or\n(iv) right to scholarships and such other forms of aid as the State Government may provide,\n\nshall be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any rights conferred on the other citizens of India by any provision of this part.\u201d\n\nWhy is Article 35A in news now?\nThe issue came up when a Kashmiri woman, Charu Wali Khan filed a petition to change the constitutional provision as she wanted succession rights in the state though she is settled outside the state.\nThis has led to a major controversy in the state.\nThe state government filed a counter petition, but the central government did not do.\nThe Central Government has submitted before the Supreme Court that it is ready to discuss on scrapping of Article 35A which does not allow people from outside the state of Jammu & Kashmir to work, settle or own property in the state.\nArticle 35A and Article 370 \u2013 Delicate Issues\n\nThe NDA Government wants to have a larger debate over the Article 35A challenging the constitutional validity of the clause.\nAn NGO, \u2018We the Citizens\u2019 have filed a writ petition to strike down Article 35A.\nThe ruling party believes that the special status, certain rights and privileges are enjoyed only by the residents of the state which has given rise to alienation and separatist identity to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe provision does not allow people from outside the state of Jammu & Kashmir to work, settle or own property in the state. Scholarships, forms of aid etc are also not allowed to non-residents of the state. (Reference: The Hindu)\nWhat is Judiciary\u2019s take on Article 35A?\nSupreme Court was ready to have a discussion on scrapping Article 35A while the state government opposed such a move.\nThe matter has been referred to three judge bench and has been given a six-week deadline to settle the dispute.\nThe state BJP leaders are vocal about repealing the Article 35A. As the matter is sub judice, the court\u2019s decision should be binding on all. This stand by the BJP has led to rifts between the BJP and PDP.\nThe Supreme Court hinted at referring petitions against Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution \u2014 which give special provisions to Jammu and Kashmir \u2014 to a Constitution bench.\nThe top court said all petitions that demand scrapping of the articles should be heard together. (Reference: Indian Express)\nArguments against scrapping Article 35A\nScrapping the Article 35A is seen as an assault on the special status of the Jammu and Kashmir by the state government.\nArticle 35A cannot be challenged on the ground that they affect the fundamental rights of the other Indian Citizens.\nThe rights of the state legislature are not unlimited and can be given only in the case of \u2013 Employment, Property, Settlement and Scholarship.\nKashmiris are apprehensive that such a move would be dominated by the Hindu nationalist groups.\nFormer chief minister Omar Abdullah also stated that this would create a bigger agitation as was witnessed in 2008 over the transfer of land to the Amarnath Shrine Board.\nArguments in favour of scrapping Article 35A\nArticle 35A was not a part of the original Constitution but was added later by a presidential order of 1954.\nArticle 370 is another matter of discussion as it is not permanent but a temporary clause.\nThe definition can be altered by the state government by passing a law with two third majority.\nAmarnath Shrine Board: Protests in 2008\nTo set up temporary shelters and facilities for Hindu pilgrims, on May 26th 2008, the Government of India and State government of Jammu and Kashmir signed an agreement to transfer 99 acres land to the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board.\nThis caused demonstrations and protest in the Kashmir valley which was the largest in the history of Kashmir with over 500,000 protesters at a single rally.\nEnvironmentalists argued that the transfer of forests land, would hamper the ecological balance as the construction of roads and dams was speculated.\nThe demands of the protesters were accepted by the state government and the transfer of land decision was revoked in July 2008.\nHindu groups counter protested to this revocation of law.\nThe convener of the Amarnath Yatra Sangharsh Samiti reacted and said that the state government was responsible to flaring these religious sentiments as it had allowed constructing Jama Masjid at Baltal but did not allow temporary structures for Hindu pilgrims.\nDespite the protest, the state government did not annul the revocation of the decision.\nThe frustration amongst the Hindus and Muslims was an attack on the secularism of the state and a regional divide erupted between the religious groups leading to loss of many lives and property.\nAn agreement was signed between the group leading the agitation and Governor of the state appointed panel by making temporary use of 40 hectares of land during the yatra period.\nPakistan taking the opportunity of the situation passed a resolution expressing concerns over the attacks on Muslims and their property by the Hindus. Indian Foreign Ministry reacted sharply to this by saying that it was interference in the internal affairs of the country.\nAnomalies of Article 35A and 370\nArticle 370 states that all emigrants from Jammu and Kashmir, including those who migrated to Pakistan are considered as state subjects.\nThis gave rise to many doubts whether a Pakistani national can settle in the state of Kashmir and buy property which was denied to many Indian citizens.\nThe provision is also gender discriminatory as the rules discriminate against Kashmir women by restricting their choice of partners in marriage. If the husband does not hold a permanent resident certificate, the subsequent rights are denied to the children. Hence a female marrying outside the state of Jammu and Kashmir is denied of property rights in that manner. (Reference: First Post)\nUnder Article 6 of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution, Indians are not conferred state subjects which prevent them from voting, holding jobs, getting admissions to colleges etc.\nThis amounts to the violation of Article 14, 15, 16, 19 of the Constitution of India.\nThe Bharatiya Jana Sangh Founder, Shyam Prasad Mukherjee termed Article 370 as the balkanization of India. He protested vigorously against the autonomy of the state by saying \u201cEk desh mein do Vidhan, Do Pradhan and Do Nishan nahi challenge\u201d\nIt is not surprising that the ruling party is following the ideals of its founder now.\nJammu and Kashmir \u2013 Not only a Political Issue but also a Security Issue\n\nJammu and Kashmir is not only a political issue but also a security issue, given the fact that Pakistan always interferes in the internal matters of India and the bilateral relations between China and India has been deteriorating. So ultimately who benefits from this controversy is the question.\nPakistan has agreed to declare Pok as its fifth province and has decided to bleed India through thousand cuts. It has been launching terrorist attacks in India since long.\nChina and Pakistan have been friends since long. China was against declaring Masood Azhar as a global terrorist, denied NSG entry to India and is also building CPEC passing through India\u2019s territory. This is hence a sovereignty issue to India.\nNot an easy decision\nThere should be deliberation on the validity of Article 370 too. (Reference IDSA)\nArticle 35A is only a clarificatory provision and itself does not confer any special power.\nThe order has also been used to override the provisions of the State Constitution.\nIf the article 35A is scrapped, all the 41 subsequent Presidential orders may then become susceptible to legal challenges.\nThe residents of J&K were deemed as Indian citizens through these Presidential Orders.\nPresidential Orders were used to extend 94 out of 97 entries in the Union List.\nPresidential Orders were used to extend 260 out of 395 Articles of the Indian Constitution to J&K and even and to impose central rule in J&K.

Questions have been raised on whether defamation should be treated as a civil wrong or criminal offence or both. It is argued that criminalizing defamation has a harsh effect on the right to freedom of speech and expression provided under article 19.\u00a0There are many demands to make defamation only as a civil wrong.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent judgment upholding Sections 499 and 500 of the IPC as constitutionally valid has received wide attention, including visible, vibrant, sometimes even vicious criticism. In this article, we analyse the \u2018Criminal Defamation\u2019 in India. We will also discuss the way forward.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is defamation?\nWhat is the difference between a civil wrong and criminal offence?\nWhy are Section 499 and 500 of IPC challenged?\nArguments for why IPC 499/500 should be declared unconstitutional\nArguments for why IPC 499/500 is not unconstitutional\nWhy should it remain a criminal offence and not made a civil offence?\nWhat is the view of the Supreme Court on defamation?\nWhat can be the way ahead?\nWhat is defamation?\nAccording to section 499 of IPC, whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in the cases hereinafter expected, to defame that person.\nSection 499 also cites exceptions. These include \u201cimputation of truth\u201d which is required for the \u201cpublic good\u201d and thus has to be published, on the public conduct of government officials, the conduct of any person touching any public question and merits of the public performance.\nSection 500, which is on punishment for defamation, reads: \u201cWhoever defames another shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.\u201d\nIn India, defamation is both civil and criminal offence. The remedy for civil defamation is covered under the Law of Torts. In a civil defamation case, a person who is defamed can move either High\u00a0Court or subordinate courts and seek damages in the form of monetary compensation from the accused. Also, under sections 499 and 500 of the IPC, a person guilty of criminal defamation can be sent to jail for two years.\nWhat is the difference between a civil wrong and criminal offence?\n\nCriminal offences and civil offences are generally different in terms of their punishment. Criminal cases will have jail time as a potential punishment, whereas civil cases generally only result in monetary damages or orders to do or not do something. But a criminal case may involve both jail time and monetary punishments in the form of fines.\nThe standard of proof is also different in a criminal case than a civil case. Crimes must generally be proved \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d, whereas civil cases are proved by lower standards of proof such as \u201cthe preponderance of the evidence\u201d (which essentially means that it was more likely than not that something occurred in a certain way).\nWhy are Section 499 and 500 of IPC challenged?\nSection 499\u00a0of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) states that any person whose reputation\u00a0has been\u00a0damaged\u00a0(or was intended to be damaged) by the material in question has the\u00a0rights to sue\u00a0for defamation.\nHowever, these are challenged on the ground of fact that they are violative of the right to freedom of speech and expression provided under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution.\nArguments for why IPC 499/500 should be declared unconstitutional\nSections 499-500 IPC do not constitute a \u201creasonable restriction\u201d on speech, as commented by many because, to begin with, even truth is not a defence. Even if a person has spoken the truth, he can be prosecuted for defamation. Under the first exception to section 499, the truth will only be a defence if the statement was made for the public good, which is a question of fact to be assessed by the court. This is an arbitrary and overbroad rule that deters people from making statements regarding politicians or political events even which they know to be true because they run the risk of a court not finding the statement to be for the public good.\nSecond, a person can be prosecuted under section 499 even if he or she has not made any verbal or written statement at all. A magistrate may issue criminal process on the mere allegation that the defendant conspired with the person who actually made the allegedly defamatory written statements.\nThird, a person can be prosecuted even for a statement about the dead. While Article 19(2) permits restricting speech in the interests of protecting the private interest in a reputation, restricting speech to protect the reputation of the deceased is excessive and over-broad.\nFourth, even an ironical statement can amount to defamation. Also, since section 499 applies to \u201cany imputation concerning any person,\u201d a criminal suit can be filed even for political speech \u2013 which is the most protected speech in a democracy.\nIt is a tool that can be easily invoked and that enables allegedly defamed persons to drag anyone to courts across the country.\nFinally, it is unclear why defamation has to be a criminal offence at all and why civil remedies are not sufficient.\nArguments for why IPC 499/500 is not unconstitutional\nThe reputation of one cannot be allowed to be crucified at the altar of the other\u2019s right of free speech. So there is no point in declaring that the present law is unconstitutional. There is a need to strike balance between article 19 and article 21.\nUnlike other inflexible provisions of the IPC, Sections 499/500 have four explanations and 10 exceptions which do both: they add content and context to the offence as also chisel away at it substantially. They constitute significant counterfactual to exclude frivolous complaints.\nSection 199(1) the CrPC safeguards the freedom of speech by placing the burden on the complainant to pursue the criminal complaint without involving state machinery. This itself filters out many frivolous complainants who are not willing to bear the significant burdens \u2013 logistical, physical and monetary \u2013 of pursuing the complaint.\nA mere misuse or abuse of law, actual or potential, can never be a reason to render a provision unconstitutional.\nWhy should it remain a criminal offence and not made a civil offence?\n\nIn India, citizens are unlikely to have enough liquidity to pay damages for civil defamation.\nIt is argued that online defamation in the Internet age can be effectively countered only by making it a criminal offence, and the law is part of the state\u2019s \u201ccompelling interest\u201d to protect the dignity and reputation of citizens.\nWhat is the view of the Supreme Court on defamation?\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that the criminal provisions of defamation are constitutionally valid and are not in conflict with the right to free speech.\nThe court stated that notwithstanding the expansive and sweeping ambit of freedom of speech, like all rights, the right to freedom of speech and expression is \u201cabsolutely sacrosanct\u201d but \u201cis not absolute.\u201d It is subject to the imposition of reasonable restrictions. It also said that the reputation of a person is an integral part of the right to life granted under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution and it cannot be allowed to be crucified at the altar of the other\u2019s right of free speech.\nWhat can be the way ahead?\n\nCriminal defamation should not be allowed to be an instrument in the hands of the state, especially when the Code of Criminal Procedure gives public servants an unfair advantage by allowing the state\u2019s prosecutors to stand in for them when they claim to have been defamed by the media or political opponents.\n\nIn recognition of the fact that many countries do have criminal defamation laws which are unlikely to be repealed in the very near future, following interim measures can be taken:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNo-one should be convicted for criminal defamation unless the party claiming to be defamed proves, beyond a reasonable doubt, the presence of all the elements of the offence, as set out below;\nThe offence of criminal defamation shall not be made out unless it has been proven that the impugned statements are false, that they were made with actual knowledge of falsity, or recklessness as to whether or not they were false, and that they were made with a specific intent to cause harm to the party claiming to be defamed;\nPublic authorities, including police and public prosecutors, should take no part in the initiation or prosecution of criminal defamation cases, regardless of the status of the party claiming to have been defamed, even if he or she is a senior public official;\nPrison sentences, suspended prison sentences, suspension of the right to express oneself through any particular form of media, or to practise journalism or any other profession, excessive fines and other harsh criminal penalties should never be available as a sanction for breach of defamation laws, no matter how egregious or blatant the defamatory statement. (Reference: Article19.org)\n\n(Qn for UPSC Mains) Criminal defamation is considered as a restriction on the right to freedom of speech and expression.

IPC \u2013 Section 377\nWay forward\nWho are Transgenders?\n\nThe term \u2018Transgender\u2019 refers to those who don\u2019t identify themselves completely with either of the dichotomous genders \u2013 male/female.\nThe American Psychological Association and World Professional Association for Transgender Health define them as \u2018people whose gender identity (sense of themselves as man or woman) or gender expression differs from that usually associated with their birth sex.\nThis grouping constitutes a significant minority, estimated to be around 25 crores globally in number.\nThey are non-heterosexual individuals.\nWhat is the difference between Sex and Gender?\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has clearly demarcated the difference between these often interchangeably used terms.\nAccording to WHO, Sex refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women while\u00a0Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviour, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women (Reference: WHO).\nRecognition of Transgender Rights: Case of Germany\nRecently, the German LGBT (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender) populace sees the transition from persecution at the hands of Nazis to the legitimization of same-sex marriages.\nIn a landmark gesture, the German Chancellor allowed other lawmakers to \u2018vote their conscience\u2019, despite her reservations towards the legislation (Note \u2013 This is a good instance to cite when arguing about reforms in Anti-Defection provisions of India. Parliamentarians, when deliberating and voting upon general policy oriented resolutions, must be bound by their conscience and not the Whip\u2019s command).\nGermany had recognised same-sex couples as instances of civil partnerships in 2001. However, it took another 16 years to translate into the status of full-marital rights.\nWith this Germany has joined the ranks of Spain, France, Britain, etc. in recognising marital rights to the vulnerable section.\nWhat is the status of Transgenders in India?\nTransgenders\u00a0do not enjoy a legal recognition in India like most of the Asian counterparts.\nHowever, some states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Odisha recognise transgenders as the third gender.\nThe Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016, intended towards the protection of transgenders is yet to be passed.\nThe Bill defines a transgender person as one who is partly female or male; or a combination of female and male; or neither female nor male.\u00a0 In addition, the person\u2019s gender must not match the gender assigned at birth.\nThe bill includes trans-men, trans-women, persons with intersex variations and gender-queers.\nWhat has India done to cater to this grouping?\n\nIn NALSA v/s Union of India, 2014,\u00a0Supreme Court (SC) of India rolled out a landmark judgment giving a framework for recognising the rights of transgenders. It stated:\n\nThe right to choose one\u2019s gender is part of the right to life and live with dignity \u2013 thus recognising the civil rights of this section.\nSC directed the government to include \u2018third gender\u2019 in all official documents/forms, thus recognising transgenders (excluding lesbian, gay and bisexual grouping) as the third gender.\nTo choose from one of the three genders was mandated to be only the person\u2019s choice.\nIt also provided for avenues of reservation within the OBC quota to this \u2018marginalised\u2019 section (Note: In June 2016 Odisha became the 1st state to provide for social welfare benefits to transgenders, however, demands of reservation in government jobs and electoral seats are yet to be heeded to).\nIt was suggested that a\u00a0commission\u00a0to protect rights of this community must be setup just like the National Commission for SC/STs.\nSC also gave a green signal to the Expert Committee Report\u00a0prepared by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJE) (This report talked about the plight of transgenders in India and provided for identification, sex-reassignment procedures, legal protection, precautions to check exploitation, etc).\n\nIn Ram Singh v/s Union of India case, 2015, (famously known as the Jat Reservation case) SC while quashing attempts of granting reservation to Jat groups in nine states stated:\n\nReservation solely on the basis of caste must be discouraged, and affirmative actions must be provided to those who are the most deserving.\nThere is a need to come up with new criteria for reservation.\n\nThus, NALSA case and later the Ram Singh v/s UoI case laid down the groundwork for the government to follow in spirit (both were welcome judgments).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso read: Surrogate Advertisement\n\nLegislative actions towards the protection of transgenders: Transgender Rights Bill\n\nEarlier Rajya Sabha has passed a bill named The Transgender Persons Bill, 2014.\u00a0However, currently, a modified version of the same has been introduced by the government as\u00a0The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill 2016 and\u00a0is pending before the house.\n\nJourney of the\u00a0Transgender Rights Bill so far\nThe original draft of The Transgender Persons Bill was passed in Rajya Sabha as a private member bill in 2014.\nIn 2015, The Central Government brought its own bill, through borrowing from the original draft.\nThe 2015 draft did away with the provision for special commissions for transgenders and\u00a0the transgender rights court proposed in 2014 bill.\nLater, after due consultations and public discourses, the final version of the draft was brought in August 2016.\nIt is opinioned by experts that this version is an even more watered down version than the 2015 draft. According to them, it is disregarding NALSA judgment, Expert committee report as well as the public comments.\nConcerns about the\u00a0Transgender Rights Bill\n\u00a0 \u00a01. Definition of Transgender\nThe definition in the Clause 2(i) is inspired from Australian Sex Discrimination Act, 2013, which defines \u2018intersex\u2019. As stated above, gender must be distinguished from sex. It is not done in the bill.\nExpert Committee Report had already discussed the differences between the two\n\u00a0 \u00a02. Right to choose a gender\nIn NLSA case, SC had directed the choice to be that of an individual \u2013 this has not been considered in this bill. Providing for a registration authority, in this case, a medical board opens avenues for red-tape and harassment.\nThe 2015 bill had a better/more progressive definition of transgenders, allowing a choice of gender from amongst male/female/others.\n\u00a0 3. Affirmative action\nNo provision for reservation has been made in the bill.\nThis clearly is a deviation from the SC directions in NLSA case and Jat reservation case.\nNot a rights-based approach.\nUnlike the recent \u2018Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016\u2019 and \u2018Mental Health-care Bill, 2016\u2019 which have taken an empathetic approach when dealing with the marginalised, the transgenders bill fails to draw the much-needed emotional connect with the transgenders. (Consider for instance the decision to decriminalise suicide in the Mental Health-care Bill. A victim will be thought of as mentally ill and therefore appropriately aided in such circumstances rather than being punished and alienated further.)\nOn similar lines, there is a need to identify rights of transgenders within the Golden Triangle \u2013 Article 14, 19 and 21. Integrating the third gender is the way ahead.\n\u00a0 4. Impact on existing laws/rules\nCriminal laws, especially related to sexual offences will have to be updated to bring them in-line with the acceptance of the third gender and therefore their sexual orientations.\nMarriage, adoption, succession rights must be guaranteed to them as well (Note:\u00a0Adoption rights were already being enjoyed by transgenders at some places like Germany).\nMost of these laws are cisnormative (based on binary gender) and consequently require an overhaul to accommodate the trinity.\nFor instance, countries like UK and Argentina have addressed this concern in their laws. India must follow their precedent in this regard.\n\u00a0 5. IPC \u2013 Section 377\nEmbracing rights of persons with non-conforming genders while criminalising persons with non-conforming sexual orientations is absurd.\nThis is even more surprising when the safeguards are given in place to check child-molestation, sexual abuse by means of laws like\u00a0POCSO Act (Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences).\nWay forward\nTaking a cue from our western counterparts like UK, France and Germany, we must harmonise our laws to reflect the \u2018unity in diversity\u2019 that we celebrate.\nThe cultural and religious norms must not be a hurdle in empowering this minority.\nThe NLSA and Ram Singh judgments and the \u2018Expert Committee Report on Transgenders\u2019 must serve as the guiding light in realising the true meaning of inclusive growth, and in doing justice to the slogan of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas.\n\nRead:\u00a0LGBTQIA+ community; Intersex Rights\n\nArticle by: Shuja Shabir"

The foundation of the present local self-government in India was laid by the Panchayati Raj System (1992).\n\nBut the history of Panchayati Raj starts from the self-sufficient and self-governing village communities. In the time of the Rig-Veda (1700 BC), evidence suggests that self-governing village bodies called \u2018sabhas\u2019 existed. With time, these bodies became panchayats (councils of five persons).\n\nPanchayats were functional institutions of grassroots governance in almost every village.

It is the basic unit of the Panchayati Raj system.\nPanchayat Samiti (Block/Mandal Level): The Panchayat Samiti is the intermediate tier that covers a block or a mandal, which typically consists of several villages.\nZila Parishad (District Level): At the top of the hierarchy is the Zila Parishad, which covers an entire district. It coordinates and supervises the activities of the lower tiers.\nHistory of local administration\n\nThe history of local administration in India is a long and diverse one, shaped by the evolution of political, cultural, and administrative systems over millennia. India has a rich tradition of local governance dating back to ancient times, and this system has evolved through various dynasties, empires, and colonial periods.\n\nAncient Period:\n\nIn ancient India, the political landscape was divided into numerous Janapadas, or small kingdoms and republics. These Janapadas had their systems of local governance, with councils and assemblies known as \u201cSabhas\u201d and \u201cSamitis\u201d that handled administrative and judicial matters.\nUnder the Mauryan Empire (322-185 BCE), Emperor Ashoka established a system of local administration with officials known as \u201cMahamatras\u201d responsible for the welfare of the people in various regions. He also inscribed edicts on pillars and rocks to communicate his policies to the local population.\n\nMedieval Period:\n\nFeudal System: During the medieval period, India experienced the emergence of feudalism. Feudal lords and local chieftains governed their territories with varying degrees of autonomy. The Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire introduced the system of \u201cjagirs\u201d or land grants to nobles in exchange for revenue collection and military service.\nLocal Chiefs and Rajas: Regional rulers, such as Rajas and Zamindars, exercised local authority and governed their territories independently, often collecting revenue from peasants.\n\nColonial Period:\n\nThe British East India Company and later the British Crown introduced a centralized administrative system that significantly altered local governance. They established a revenue collection system, where land revenue was collected directly from peasants or through intermediaries known as zamindars.\nThe British also introduced local self-government institutions such as municipalities and panchayats. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms (1919) and the Government of India Act (1935) allowed for some degree of local representation in governance.\n\nThe village panchayat, as a system of administration, began in the British days, as their offer to satisfy the demands for local autonomy.\n\nThey opened up the governance of the lowest levels to the citizens. The GoI Act, of 1935 also authorizes the provinces to enact legislation.\n\nEvolution of local self-government in India\n\nEven though such minor forms of local governance were evident in India, the framers of the constitutions, unsatisfied with the existing provisions, included Article 40 among the Directive Principles, whereby:\n\n\u201cThe state shall take steps to organize village panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government.\u201d\n\nLater, the conceptualization of the system of local self-government in India took place through the formation and effort of four important committees from the year 1957 to 1986. It will be helpful if we take a look at the committee and the important recommendations put forward by them.\n\nBalwant Rai Mehta Committee (1957)\n\nOriginally appointed by the Government of India to examine the working of two of its earlier programs, the committee submitted its report in November 1957, in which the term \u2018democratic decentralization\u2018 first appears.\n\nThe important recommendations are:\n\nEstablishment of a three-tier Panchayati Raj system \u2013 gram panchayat at the village level (direct election), panchayat Samiti at the block level, and Zila Parishad at the district level (indirect election).\nDistrict Collector to be the chairman of Zila Parishad.\nTransfer of resources and power to these bodies to be ensured.\n\nThe existing National Development Council accepted the recommendations. However, it did not insist on a single, definite pattern to be followed in the establishment of these institutions. Rather, it allowed the states to devise their patterns, while the broad fundamentals were to be the same throughout the country.\n\nRajasthan (1959) adopted the system first, followed by Andhra Pradesh in the same year. Some states even went ahead to create four-tier systems and Nyaya panchayats, which served as judicial bodies.\n\nAshok Mehta Committee (1977-1978)\n\nThe committee was constituted by the Janata government of the time to study Panchayati Raj institutions. Out of a total of 132 recommendations made by it, the most important ones are:\n\nThree-tier system to be replaced by a two-tier system.\nPolitical parties should participate at all levels in the elections.\nCompulsory powers of taxation are to be given to these institutions.\nZila Parishad is to be made responsible for planning at the state level.\nA minister for Panchayati Raj is to be appointed by the state council of ministers.\nConstitutional recognition to be given to Panchayati Raj institutions.\n\nUnfortunately, the Janata government collapsed before action could be taken on these recommendations.\n\nG V K Rao Commitee (1985)\n\nAppointed by the Planning Commission, the committee concluded that the developmental procedures were gradually being taken away from the local self-government institutions, resulting in a system comparable to \u2018grass without roots\u2019.\n\nZila Parishad is to be given prime importance and all developmental programs at that level are to be handed to it.\nPost of DDC (District Development Commissioner) to be created acting as the chief executive officer of the Zila Parishad.\nRegular elections are to be held\nL M Singhvi Committee (1986)\n\nConstituted by the Rajiv Gandhi government on \u2018Revitalisation of Panchayati Raj institutions\u00a0 for Democracy and Development, its important recommendations are:\n\nConstitutional recognition for PRI institutions.\nNyaya Panchayats to be established for clusters of villages\n\nThough the 64th Constitutional Amendment bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 1989 itself, the Rajya Sabha opposed it. It was only during the Narasimha Rao government\u2019s term that the idea finally became a reality in the form of the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, of 1992.\n\nPanchayati Raj System: 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment acts, 1992\n\nThe acts of 1992 added two new parts IX and IX-A\u00a0 to the constitution. It also added two new schedules \u2013 11 and 12 which contain the lists of functional items of Panchayats and Municipalities.\n\nIt provides for a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj in every state \u2013 at the village, intermediate, and district levels.\n\nRead: Panchayati Raj\n\nWhat are Panchayats and Municipalities?\n\nPanchayat and Municipality are the generic terms for the governing body at the local level. Both exist as three-tier systems \u2013 at the lower, intermediate, and upper levels.\nThe 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for a Gram Sabha as the foundation of the Panchayati Raj system. It is essentially a village assembly consisting of all the registered voters in the area of the panchayat. The state has the power to determine what kind of powers it can exercise, and what functions it has to perform at the village level.\nThe 74th Constitutional Amendment Act provides for three types of Municipalities:\n\u00a0Nagar Panchayat\u00a0for a transitional area between a rural and urban area.\n\u00a0Municipal Council for a small urban area.\n\u00a0Municipal Corporation for a large urban area.\nMunicipalities represent urban local self-government.\nMost of the provisions of the two acts are parallel, differing only in the fact that they are being applied to either a Panchayat or a Municipality respectively.\nEach Gram sabha is the meeting of a particular constituency called a ward.\nEach ward has a representative chosen from among the people themselves by direct election.\nThe chairperson of the Panchayat or Municipality at the intermediate and district level is elected from among these representatives at the immediately lower level by indirect election.\nTypes of Urban Local Self-Governments\n\nThere are eight types of urban local governments currently existing in India:\n\nMunicipal Corporations.\nMunicipality.\nNotified area committee.\nTown area committee.\nCantonment board.\nTownship.\nPort trust.\nSpecial purpose agency\n\nHow are the elections held in the local government bodies?\n\nAll seats of representatives of local bodies are filled by people chosen through direct elections.\nThe conduct of elections is vested in the hands of the State election commission.\nThe chairpersons at the intermediate and district levels shall be elected indirectly from among the elected representatives at the immediately lower level.\nAt the lowest level, the chairperson shall be elected in a mode defined by the state legislature.\nSeats are reserved for SC and ST proportional to their population.\nOut of these reserved seats, not less than one-third shall be further reserved for women.\nThere should be a blanket reservation of one-third of seats for women in all the constituencies taken together too (which can include the already reserved seats for SC and ST).\nThe acts bar the interference of courts in any issue relating to the election of local bodies.\nWhat are the Qualifications needed to be a member of the Panchayat or Municipality?\n\nAny person who is qualified to be a member of the state legislature is eligible to be a member of the Panchayat or Municipality.\n\n\u201cBut he shall not be disqualified on the ground that he is less than 25 years of age if he has attained the age of 21 years\u201d\n\nThis\u00a0means that, unlike the state legislature, a person needs to attain only 21 years of age to be a member of a panchayat/municipality.\n\nWhat is the duration of the Local Government bodies?\n\nThe local governing bodies are elected for a term of five years.\nFresh elections should be conducted before the expiry of the five-year term.\nIf the panchayat/municipality is dissolved before the expiry of its term, elections shall be conducted within six months and the new panchayat/municipality will hold office for the remainder of the term if the term has more than six months duration.\nAnd for another five years if the remaining term is less than six months.\nWhat are the Powers invested in these Local Self-Government bodies?\n\nThe powers of local bodies are not exclusively defined. They can be tailor-fitted by the state governments according to the environment of the states. In general, the State governments can assign powers to Panchayats and Municipalities that may enable them to prepare plans for economic development and social justice. They may also be authorized to levy, collect, or appropriate taxes.\n\nSummary\n\nTo conclude, local self-government is one of the most innovative governance change processes our country has gone through. The noble idea of taking the government of a country into the hands of the grassroots level is indeed praiseworthy.\n\nHowever, like any system in the world, this system is also imperfect. Problems of maladministration and misappropriation of funds are recurring. But this shall not stand in the way of efficient governance; and if these ill practices are rooted out, there would be no comparisons around the world to our system of local self-government.\n\nRead: Finances of Panchayati Raj institutions\n\nArticle by: Unnikrishna Varma"

SPECIAL OFFICER FOR LINGUISTIC MINORITIES\nThe formation of this office was prescribed by the States Reorganization Commission.\nThis was formed by the Seventh Constitutional Amendment Act of 1956 which inserted a new article 350-B in Part XVII.\nThe Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities is appointed by the president.\nThe Commissioner has its headquarters at Allahabad with three regional offices at Belgaum, Chennai, and Kolkata.\nThe Commissioner is assisted by Deputy Commissioner and an Assistant Commissioner at headquarters.\nThe Commissioner falls under the Ministry of Minority Affairs and submits reports to the President through Union Minority Affairs Minister.\n\nRole of the Commissioner:\n\nAll the grievances related to the various safeguards provided for the linguistic minorities are looked into by the Commissioner.\nThe Commissioner strives for providing equal opportunities to the linguistic minorities.\nHe works for the effective implementation of the various safeguards.\nConstitutional Bodies vs Non-Constitutional Bodies\n\nFor any student of Indian Polity, Constitutional Posts and Constitutional Bodies are very important.\n\nAs discussed above, there are about 20 bodies that find mention in the Indian Constitution.\n\nApart from the Constitutional Bodies, there are also various Non-Constitutional Bodies you should learn about.\n\nWe will be covering non-constitutional bodies in India (which include statutory, regulatory, and various quasi-judicial bodies) in separate posts."

            "[CONTENT]": "Non-constitutional bodies or Extra Constitutional bodies are authorities or agencies that are not defined in the Indian Constitution.\n\nWe have learned about Constitutional Posts and Constitutional Bodies in our Indian Polity notes.\n\nNon-constitutional bodies in India refer to organizations or institutions that are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India but play a significant role in the governance and functioning of the country. These bodies are typically established by the government through executive orders or legislation.\n\nIn this post, we shall learn about Non-Constitutional Bodies in India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is meant by a Non-Constitutional Body?\nClassification of Non-Constitutional Bodies\nNon-Constitutional Bodies in India (Video Class)\nList of Extra Constitutional\u00a0 Bodies in India that are regulatory\nList of Non-Constitutional\u00a0 Bodies in India which are quasi-judicial\nUPSC CSE Questions from the topic\nWhat is meant by a Non-Constitutional Body?\n\nA non-constitutional body is an organization or institution which is not mentioned in the Constitution of India.\n\nUnlike a Constitutional Body, a non-constitutional body does not derive its powers from the Indian Constitution.\n\nUsually, a non-constitutional body derives powers from corresponding laws passed by the Indian Parliament.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThere are also non-constitutional bodies that derive power based on Indian Government Orders (Executive Resolution).\n\nClassification of Non-Constitutional Bodies\n\nBased on how the body derives its power, non-constitutional bodies can be broadly classified into two \u2013 (1) Statutory Bodies (2) Non-Statutory Bodies.\n\nStatutory Bodies \u2013 They get the power from a statute (ie an Act enacted by the Legislature). Eg: National Investigation Agency (NIA), National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Lokpal and Lokayukta, etc.\nNon-Statutory Bodies \u2013 They usually get the power from an Executive order. Eg: NITI Aayog, National Development Council (NDC) etc\n\nStatutory Bodies can be further classified into two based on their roles and responsibilities. They are (1) Regulatory Bodies and (2) Quasi-Judicial Bodies.\n\nRegulatory Bodies \u2013 A regulatory body is a government agency that is accountable for exercising autonomous authority over some area of human activity in a regulatory or supervisory capacity. However, their regulatory interventions are outside executive observation.

In this post, let\u2019s see the mandate of NCM and measures to make it more effective.\n\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs established the National Minorities Commission of India in a resolution on January 12, 1978. It mentioned that:\n\n\u201cdespite the safeguards provided in the Constitution and the laws in force, there persists among the Minorities a feeling of inequality and discrimination. In order to preserve secular traditions and to promote National Integration, the Government of India attaches the highest importance to the enforcement of the safeguards provided for the Minorities in the Constitution\u201d.\n\nThe Minorities Commission was detached from the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1984, and placed under the Ministry of Welfare. Once the National Commission for Minorities Act was enacted in 1992, the Minorities Commission became a statutory body and was renamed as National Commission for Minorities.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNational Commission for Minorities Act 1992\nDefinition of minority\nConstitutional provisions for minorities\nFundamental Rights:\nDirective Principles of State Policy\nFundamental Duties\nRole of NCM\nInstances where NCM played a role\nNational Commission for Minorities: Why in news?\nIssues faced by the NCM\nMeasures to make NCM more effective\nConclusion\nNational Commission for Minorities Act 1992\n\nUnder the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 the government formed the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) which consist of Chairperson, a Vice-Chairperson and five Members.\n\nThe five Members including the Chairperson shall be from amongst the minority communities.\n\nDefinition of minority\n\nThe act defines a minority as \u201ca community notified as such by the Central government.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam?

In 2012, a team was sent to Assam to investigate the Bodo-Muslim clashes, and their findings were submitted to the government.\n\nNCM is an important institution for our country because it allows for venting of minorities\u2019 grievances. However, it suffers from various issues.\n\nNational Commission for Minorities: Why in news?\n\nJan 2021: The 7-member National Commission for Minorities (NCM) is down to just one member after the retirement of its vice-chairperson in October and the non-filling of 5 other seats since May 2020.\n\nIssues faced by the NCM\n\nIn a book titled Minorities Commission 1978-2015: Minor Role in Major Affairs authored by former NCM chairman Tahir Mahmood, NCM is referred to as a toothless tiger, white elephant, Sarkari puppet. It has been referred to as \u201cNational Commission for Tokenism\u201d too.\n\nNo constitutional status: NCM does not have a constitutional status (it is a statutory body) which if bestowed upon it would give NCM autonomy and clout it needs to carry out its functions effectively.\nAbsence of any constitutional power: It lacks the constitutional power to conduct independent enquiries or investigations in cases of the transgression of minorities\u2019 rights, and especially in cases of communal violence, render the Commission legally incapacitated to fulfil its duty. This limitation has also been mentioned in a recommendation in the Commission\u2019s 2007-08, 2008-09, and 2010-11 annual reports of the Commission.\nToothless tiger: It hasn\u2019t been provided with any \u201cteeth\u201d in terms of their legal capacity to carry out their Constitutional mandate. The decision of the Commission can be overturned by the district and high courts.\nNo reports tabled: Section 13 of the NCM Act mandates that the annual report, \u201ctogether with the memorandum of action taken on the recommendations contained therein\u2019\u2019, as well as the reasons for non-acceptance of the recommendations be tabled before Parliament annually. Sources said these reports have not been tabled in Parliament since 2010. Further, its recommendations are routinely rejected or simply filed away and forgotten.\nPartisan representation: There has been a shift in the kind of members appointed to the body. While past appointments included former chief justices, civil servants, academicians etc, the recent appointees were mostly \u201csocial activists\u201d with links to the ruling party.\nCapacity related challenges: These include human resource deficiency as is the case now. The Commission is unable to effectively fulfil its mandate when the key positions of Commission members remain vacant. For example, the Commission mandated to conduct hearing is unable to process the numerous cases it receives.\nUnderutilization of technology:\u00a0 there is no real-time communication of schedules and appointments for hearings with the complainants which results in wastage of time and money.\nOnly a few State minority commissions: A major recommendation of the Annual Conference of State Minorities Commissions (2008) was \u201cthat the State Governments should also set up State Minorities Commissions on similar lines (as that of the NCM).\u201d However, only 16 states have set up such commissions. These too remain understaffed and mostly dysfunctional due to lack of capacity in human resource as well as in the absence of a regular monitoring mechanism of the State Commissions\u2019 workings.\nPressure on NCM: with ineffective State Finance Commissions, the pressure is borne by the NCM which further reduced its efficiency.\nInadequate powers to State Minority Commissions: State Minority Commissions are not given adequate powers to implement, monitor, and review developmental programs and welfare schemes under the Prime Minister\u2019s 15 Point Program for Minorities.\nLack of research: Only a small proportion of the allocated budget of the Commission is spent in research activities even when conducting \u201cstudies, research and analysis on the issues relating to the socio-economic and educational development of minorities\u201d is among the primary mandates of NCM.\nMeasures to make NCM more effective\nTo reduce pendency of cases at the organizational level, the Commission should set certain baseline targets related to the pendency rates.\nAt regular intervals, conducting a staffing needs assessment may be a useful solution to address the problem of vacant positions at the leadership level.\nNCM should develop a Stakeholder Satisfaction Survey for parties to anonymously provide feedback regarding how their appeal was processed, irrespective of the decision made.\nTechnological upgrades including investment in more sophisticated information management systems could help reduce the pendency rates of cases in the Commission such as e-hearing.\nThe strengthening of the State Commissions and setting up new state-level commissions, where these do not yet exist, can help in reducing the pendency rates and increasing hearings\u2019 effectiveness of the Commission.\nNCM could fulfil its duties assigned in its mandate if the greater legal and constitutional authority is extended to the Commission. The Commission could be more effective if it has greater authority to conduct independent enquiries in cases of the transgression of rights of the minorities\nConclusion\n\nTo hold true to our commitment to the idea of unity in diversity, and ensure compliance to the constitutional articles viz, Article 15 and 16, Article 25 (1), 26 and 28, Article 29, Article 30, there is a need to give teeth to this organisation.\n\nAs we witness the rise of populist-majoritarian movements which tend to render minority rights ignored and suppressed, the National Minorities Commission (NCM) as an institution has the potential to serve as the protector and a beacon of minority rights in India."

The status, salary, and allowances of state ICs were also subject to revision under the amendment.\nImpact of the RTI Act\nEnhanced Transparency and Accountability: By enabling access to information, the RTI Act has made the workings of the government more transparent and accountable to the citizens.\nEmpowerment of Citizens: It empowers the common man to seek and obtain information about government activities and decisions, promoting an informed citizenry.\nReduction in Corruption: The possibility of public scrutiny has acted as a deterrent to corruption within public offices, as actions and decisions need to be recorded and could be made public.\nImproved Governance: The Act has led to better governance practices, as public authorities are now more vigilant and responsible, knowing that citizens can request information regarding their actions.\nChallenges\n\nDespite its success, the implementation of the RTI Act faces challenges such as:\n\nLack of awareness among citizens about their rights under the Act.\nReluctance and resistance from some parts of the bureaucracy in sharing information.\nDelays and backlogs in the processing of RTI requests and appeals.\n\nThe Right to Information Act, of 2005, is a powerful tool for democracy and good governance, empowering citizens to participate more actively in the democratic process by making the government more open, accountable, and transparent."

            "[CONTENT]": "In this post, we discuss the Anti-Defection Law which has been part of the Indian Constitution since 1985. The law sets the provisions for disqualification of elected members on the grounds of defection to another political party (Eg: If elected MPs of Congress shift their allegiance to BJP or vice versa). We will also see the need for reforms in the anti-defection law.\n\nThe Anti-Defection Law in India is a legal framework aimed at preventing elected representatives from defecting or changing their allegiance from one political party to another.\n\nThis law was introduced to curb the unethical practice of \u201cfloor-crossing,\u201d which can lead to instability in governments and compromise the democratic process. The provisions related to anti-defection are primarily enshrined in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is anti-defection law?\nWhat are the grounds for disqualification under the Anti-Defection Law?\nPoints to be noted regarding anti-defection\nQuestions of \u2018split\u2019 and \u2018merger\u2019: Loopholes in anti-defection law\nReforms\u00a0to anti-defection law: 91st amendment\nWhat is not defection?\nIs disqualification under anti-defection law judicially reviewable?\nConcerns raised against the current\u00a0anti-defection law\nPossible reforms that can be made to anti-defection law\nPrevious year question\nWhat is anti-defection law?\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nThe Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution is popularly known as the Anti-Defection Act. The original constitution had no such provisions.\n\nIt was included in the Constitution in 1985 by the Rajiv Gandhi government. The main intent of the law was to deter \u201cthe evil of political defections\u201d by legislators motivated by the lure of office or other similar considerations.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDefection is defined as voluntarily giving up the membership of a political party or voting against the party\u2019s official whip in the legislature.\n\nWhat are the grounds for disqualification under the Anti-Defection Law?\n\nElected members can be disqualified on grounds of defection if they violate the party line by either voting against the party, abstaining from voting, or expressing dissent on party matters.\n\nIf an elected member voluntarily gives up his membership in a political party;\nIf he votes or abstains from voting in such House contrary to any direction issued by his political party or anyone authorized to do so, without obtaining prior permission.\n\nAs a pre-condition for his disqualification, his abstention from voting should not be condoned by his party or the authorized person within 15 days of such incident.\n\nExemptions: There are certain situations where defection is not considered grounds for disqualification. For example, if a legislator, as a member of one political party, joins another party after a merger between the two parties, it may not lead to disqualification.\n\nPoints to be noted regarding anti-defection\nArticles 102 (2) and 191 (2) deals with anti-defection.\nThe provision intends to check the corruption/horse-trading in parliament/check the popular phenomenon \u201cAaya Ram Gaya Ram \u201c in the Indian polity which started in the 1960s. Note: The intention was never \u201cto bring stability\u201d to governments.\nThe law disallows MPs/ MLAs to switch parties after elections, making the members follow the whips issued by their party.\nIt also applies to a nominated member if he/ she joins a political party after 6 months of nomination and to an independent candidate if he/she joins a party after the election.\nRefer to the parliament handbook if you need to know the detailed provisions of anti-defection.\nQuestions of \u2018split\u2019 and \u2018merger\u2019: Loopholes in anti-defection law\n\nInitially, the law allowed defections if it involved one-third of members, ie. it had provisions regarding exemption from disqualification in case of a \u2018split\u2019 in a political party. But undesirably it resulted in mass defections instead of individual defections.\n\nThe decision on disqualification is made by the Presiding Officer of the concerned legislative body (Speaker in the case of the Lok Sabha or State Assembly, and Chairman in the case of the Rajya Sabha or Legislative Council).\n\nReforms\u00a0to anti-defection law: 91st amendment\n\nThe issue of mass defection because of the 1/3rd rule\u00a0was remedied through the 91st Amendment which increased the bar from one-third to two-thirds. Thus at least two-thirds of the members of a party have to be in favor of a \u2018merger\u2019 for it to possess validity in the eyes of the law.\n\nWhat is not defection?\nA split in a political party won\u2019t be considered a defection if a complete political party merges with another political party.\nIf a new political party is created by the elected members of one party\nIf he or she or alternative members of the party haven\u2019t accepted the merger between the two parties and opted to perform as a separate group from the time of such a merger.\nIs disqualification under anti-defection law judicially reviewable?\n\nThe speaker/ chairman of the house has the authority to decide on defection cases. Speaker sits as a tribunal while deciding on defection cases. All proceedings about any question on disqualification of a member of a House under this Schedule are deemed to be proceedings in Parliament or the Legislature of a state. No court has any jurisdiction. However, the decision can be brought to court after the Kihoto Hollohan case of 1992.\n\nThe law states that the decision is final and not subject to judicial review.\u00a0The Supreme Court struck down part of this condition.\u00a0It held that there may not be any judicial intervention until the presiding officer gives his order.\u00a0However, the final decision is subject to appeal in the High Courts and Supreme Court.\n\nDoes anti-defection law curtail the right of free speech of legislators?\n\nThis issue was addressed by the five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in 1992 (Kihoto Hollohan vs Zachilhu and others).\u00a0It held that the law does not violate any rights or freedoms, or the basic structure of parliamentary democracy.\n\nConcerns raised against the current\u00a0anti-defection law\nIt affects the independence of MPs/ MLAs.\nConstitution drafters didn\u2019t intend to give the control of members to political parties. Interestingly, it\u2019s only in the 10th schedule, which was included in 1985 that political parties are mentioned in the constitution. (Also chief whip).\nMany members speak up their minds and convictions \u2013more discussion and thus better debates and solutions in parliament. Anti-defection law is against this.\nIn a diverse country like India, members also represent their constituencies. Hence, every member needs to be given voice to give voice to all regions and sections of the population.\nNo incentive for MPs/MLAs to research and understand policies.\nPossible reforms that can be made to anti-defection law\nNowadays, no real democratic discussions happen inside political parties about major issues affecting the country. Individual MPs and MLAs need to be empowered to think independently.\nAnti-defection law should be applied only to confidence and no-confidence motions (Dinesh Goswami Committee on electoral reforms, 1990) or only when the government is in danger (Law Commission (170th report, 1999).\nThe rationale that a representative is elected based on the party\u2019s program can be extended to pre-poll alliances.\nInstead of giving the Speaker the authority for disqualification, the decision should be made by the president or the governor on the advice of the Election Commission.\u00a0 This would make the process similar to the disqualification procedure as given in the Representation of Peoples Act (RPA).\nThere can be additional penalties for defectors as well.\nPrevious year question\n\nSee the UPSC CSE Mains question for General Studies paper 2 in 2013. It has a question (Question No:1) connected to anti-defection.\n\nQuestion:\u00a0The role of individual MPs (Members of Parliament) has diminished over the years and as a result healthy constructive debates on policy issues are not usually witnessed. How far can this be attributed to the anti-defection law, which was legislated but with a different intention?\n\nArticle by: Mohammed Danish"

Dalits and Tribals still face discrimination.

So in many instances, the case is registered under IPC or CrPC than PoA.\n\n1. Cow vigilantism\nThe term \u201cCow vigilantism\u201d is used to describe the lawlessness happening under the name of Cow protection.\nDalits and Muslims are at the receiving end of this vigilantism.\nSince Dalits are concentrated in the occupation of leather making from hides of the cow, they are invariably targeted by vigilantes.\nCow vigilantism has increased since past two years.\n2. Honour killing\nIn a society like India, where caste structures are still dominant in the form of endogamy, honour killings are prevalent on a wide scale.\nDalits are almost always at the receiving end of the violence.\nIn Lata Singh vs. the State of UP, Supreme Court has opined that inter-caste marriages are in the national interest as they destroy the caste system.\nBhagwan Dass v.

He had often fought against the practice\nMahad satyagraha for the opening of community tanks for Dalits\nHe proposed an anti-boycott law\nHe recognized that discrimination occurs in multiple axes like boycott-stigmatization-segregation and try to fight it out on all these axes\nMaharashtra enacted a law against a social boycott: Maharashtra Prohibition of People from Social Boycott (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2016.\nNeed a comprehensive anti-discrimination law in\u00a0lines of civil rights entitlements in US-UK.\nLaw Commission drafted the Prohibition of Unlawful Assembly (Interference with the Freedom of Matrimonial Alliances) Bill, 2011 that sought to declare khap panchayats unlawful.\n4.

Thus OBCs became the new oppressor of Dalits in place of traditional upper castes.\nPost-1990 reforms, there was a resurgence among Dalits due to\nreservation policy led to the emergence of the middle class among Dalits who spearheaded Dalit movements.\nIdentity politics, from leaders among Dalits themselves, began to express itself.\nurbanization and other opportunities followed by 1990 reforms lead to improvement in Dalits life\nThis resurgence was met with violent clashes among upper castes/OBCs and Dalits.\nMany scholars like Surinder.S.Jodhka have attributed the increased atrocities to the tensions caused between upper castes and Dalits due to the perceived upward mobility of Dalits.\nBut Dalits were at the receiving end of almost all these atrocities like\nKhairlanji massacre in Maharashtra 2008\nBhima-Koregaon violence in Maharashtra 2017\nUna violence\n5. Discrimination in universities\nThe suicide of Rohit Vemula in Hyderabad 2016\nExamples of atrocities in independent India\nKizhavenmani, Tamil Nadu (1958) in which 44 SCs were burnt to death in a confined building because SC agricultural labourers sought a little raise in their very low wages. The high court acquitted all the accused.\nKaramchedu, Andhra Pradesh, 1984: Five SCs were massacred. The trial court convicted many of the accused. The high court acquitted all. The Supreme Court upheld the trial court judgment \u2013 a clear example that acquittals do not mean false cases.\nTsunduru, Andhra Pradesh, 1991: Eight SCs were massacred. The trial court convicted the accused in 2007. The high court acquitted them in 2014. The Supreme Court has admitted a special leave petition (SLP) of the surviving victims and survivors of victims.\nSix cases of Bihar including the Bathani Tola (1996) and Laxmanpur Bathe (1997). In most of these, the trial court convicted the accused. In all of these, the high court acquitted the accused. Appeals are pending in the Supreme Court.\nKambalapalli, Karnataka. The prime witness in this case, who is the sole survivor and head of the family whose other members were massacred, turned \u201chostile\u201d due to a threat of life, resulting in the acquittal of all the accused.\nAre all crimes against Dalits based on caste discriminations?\n\nThere are many nuanced and subtle form of atrocities that are meted out to SC/ST. Since these are highly intertwined with common IPC/CrPC crimes, it is quite complex to dissect caste discriminations from everyday occurrences of violence.\n\nEvery passing day there will be one or other incidents of atrocities against SC/ST. In fact, everyday life of them is a struggle against entrenched atrocities, as they are facing discrimination from every facet of life, be it may be in the field of education, employment, in all the limbs of the state and institutions.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSince Dalits are widespread and live in close vicinity to other castes, atrocities against them are more frequent and more visible. Tribals are concentrated in some areas and are more isolated from other sections of society.\n\nThe government has introduced many measures for preventing these atrocities, especially under the aegis of Article 17. Most important among them is PoA act, which was and is a watershed act for tilting the power balance of society. Its implementation has seen many stumbling blocks leading to many atrocities against Dalits as shown above. These atrocities are widespread throughout the breadth of the nation.\n\nResistance from Dalits against atrocities against them\n\nOne notable change during present times is the resistance cropping from among the Dalits itself rather than being passive recipients of atrocities as in earlier times. Bhim army is one such example.\n\nAlso, many youth leaders from the community are cropping up, inspired by and reinventing Ambedkar, since the 1990s. Jignesh Mevani is an example.\n\nAs the community is exerting their independence and resisting against injustices, PoA act is the main tool in their arsenal. But judicial observation in Kashinath Mahajan case\u00a0may prove detrimental in this respect by impinging a final nail in the coffin of the act, which was always accused of being misused since its inception.\n\nGovernment actions against atrocities\n\nIndian Constitution, Indian Parliament, and various state legislatures have stringent provisions against atrocities targeting SCs or STs.\n\nIndian Constitution\nArticle 17 seeks to abolish \u2018untouchability\u2019.\nthe institution of \u2018untouchability\u2019 refers not just to the avoidance or prohibition of physical contact but to a much broader set of social sanctions.\nArticle 46 \u2013 \u00a0promote the educational and economic interests of SCs, STs, and other weaker sections of the society and to protect them from social injustice and exploitation\nArticle 338 \u2013\u00a0National Commission for Scheduled Castes\nIts functions include among others:\ninvestigate and monitor all matters relating to the constitutional and other legal safeguards for the SCs and to evaluate their working;\ninquire into specific complaints with respect to the deprivation of rights and safeguards of the SCs;\n338-A \u2013\u00a0National Commission for\u00a0Scheduled Tribes\nIts functions are same as that of NCSC, but with respect to ST than SC\nState Actions\nSchedules listing the castes and tribes recognized as deserving of special treatment because of the massive discrimination practised against them. This was drawn up in colonial times as 1935 act introduced Scheduled\u00a0caste and Scheduled tribe categories\u00a0\nAfter Independence, the same policies have been continued and many new ones added.\nScheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and Rules, 1995\nThoratt committee 2007 \u2013 first ever committee constituted to study caste discrimination in higher education sector.\nHRD ministry fails to implement Thorat committee recommendations.\nSC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (POA Act 1989)\n\nArticle 17 seeks to abolish \u2018untouchability\u2019\nUntouchability (Offences) Act 1955 was enacted\nThe lacuna in the above act lead to the passing of Protection of Civil Rights Act\u00a01976\nnormal provisions of the existing laws:\u00a0Protection of Civil Rights Act,\u00a0Indian Penal Code, were inadequate to check many dimensions of atrocities meted to SC/ST. This lead to\u00a0Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and Rules, 1995.\nThe Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act is known as POA, SC/ST Act, the Prevention of Atrocities Act, or the Atrocities Act.\n\nThe provisions of SC/ST Act can be divided into three categories:-\n\nprovisions of criminal law.\nCreation of new types of offences not in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or in the Protection of Civil Rights Act 1955 (PCRA).\nAtrocities can be committed only by non-SCs and non-STs on members of the SC or ST communities. Crimes among SCs and STs or between STs and SCs do not come under the purview of this Act.\nDefines various types of atrocities against SCs/STs and prescribes stringent punishments for the same.\nEnhanced minimum punishment for public servants.\nPunishment for neglect of duties by a public servant(Section 4)\nCancellation of arms licenses in the areas identified where an atrocity may take place or has taken place and grant arms licenses to SCs and STs\nDenial of anticipatory bail (Section 18) provided in Section 438 of the CrPC\nDenial of probation to convict (Section 19).\nprovisions for relief and compensation for victims\nprovisions that establish special authorities for the implementation and monitoring of the Act.\nCreation of Special Courts and special public prosecutor\u00a0\nMandatory, periodic monitoring system at District, State and National level\nIdentification of atrocity prone areas\u00a0\nNHRC report on the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act\nThe indifference of society, lopsided implementation of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989, lack of political will in removing the historical injustices faced by this section of society has been detrimental to them.\nThe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015\nAmends existing categories and adds new categories of actions to be treated as offences.\nOffences in case of sexual exploiting of SC or ST woman: (i) Using acts, words or gestures of a sexual\u00a0nature against SC/ST woman. (ii) Touching an SC/ST woman intentionally in a sexual manner without her consent (iii) Practice of dedicating an SC/ST women\u00a0as a devadasi to a temple\u2026\nNew offences: (a) garlanding with footwear, (b) compelling to dispose or carry human or animal carcasses, or do manual scavenging, (c) abusing SCs or STs by caste name in public, (d) attempting to promote feelings of ill-will against SCs or STs or disrespecting any deceased person held in high esteem, and (e) imposing or threatening a social or economic\u00a0boycott.\nPreventing SCs or STs from undertaking the following activities will be considered an offence: (a) using common property resources, (c) entering any place of worship that is open to the public, and (d) entering an education or health institution\nPresumption to the offences:\u00a0If the accused was acquainted with the victim or his family, the court will presume that the accused was aware of the caste or tribal identity of the victim unless proved otherwise.\nThe act specifies the duties of public servants\nUnder the earlier Act, a court of Session at the district level is deemed a Special Court\nAmendment specifies that an Exclusive Special Court and\u00a0 exclusive Special Public Prosecutor\u00a0must be provided at the district level\nSpecial courts must be established where offences are less in number\ncases should be disposed of within two months\nAdds a chapter on the rights of victims and witness.\nThe duty of the state to make arrangements for the protection of victims, their, and witnesses.\nSubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs The State of Maharashtra [Review of\u00a0SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act ]\nSupreme Court opined that SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (PoA act) is being misused and checks are needed to prevent such misuse.\nThe act has become a tool to persecute innocents and public servants for political and personal gains.\nProvided guidelines for preventing the misuse of the act.\nPreliminary inquiry at the level of DSP is required to verify the authenticity of the case before registering FIR.\nA person can be released on anticipatory bail unless a prima facie case of crimes or atrocities is made out.\nNo FIR should be registered against government servants without the approval of the appointing authority.\nPoA act had to be interpreted in a manner which will ensure that \u201ccasteism is not perpetuated\u201d through the implementation of the law.\nCritical analysis of the Judgment in\u00a0Subhash Kashinath Mahajan Case on\u00a0SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act\n\nMany law experts are of the view that this judgement is without considering the\u00a0socio-cultural realities of caste atrocities.\nThe judgement didn\u2019t give any statistical pieces of evidence but relied on several High Court judgements.\nIt equated high rate of acquittals to a large number of false cases.\nBut increasing acquittal can\u2019t be the reason for the case being false.\nEntrenched discrimination and prejudice of the establishment are one of the reasons of acquittals.\nAnother reason can be intimidation of victims, their survivors, and witnesses by various means including a social and economic boycott.\nThe constitutional validity of exclusion of anticipatory bail had been upheld in\u00a0Kartar Singh case.\nThe case has clarified that anticipatory bail is a statutory right and not comes under Right to Life.\nSection 18 of the PoA act especially excludes anticipatory bail.\nThe court while upholding ideals of personal liberty and innocence until pronounced guilty, have ignored the socio-cultural reality of caste system in India.\nIn Lalita Kumari vs Government of Uttar Pradesh,\u00a0the Supreme Court directed that prompt registration of FIR is mandatory under Section 154 of the Cr.P.C. if the information discloses commission of a cognisable offence and no preliminary enquiry is permissible in such a situation. Mahajan judgement ignores this precedent.\nDilution of PoA act will have a crippling effect on social justice.\nBecause of the juxtaposition of the powerful and the powerless in India\u2019s caste system in every village, it is very difficult to secure proper investigation and quick and successful trial.\nDelay in investigation and trial result in intimidation of victims and witnesses.\nWill make the act toothless, roll back social transformation.\nThis case treads to break the thin line between\u00a0judicial activism and judicial over-reach.\nSupreme Court in Rajesh Sharma vs the State of Uttar Pradesh,\u00a0assumed misuse of the anti-dowry provision of Section 498A in IPC, but CJI revisited the case remarking that the court cannot write law but can only interpret a law that is ambiguous or silent on certain aspects, and not when it is crystal-clear.\nSC had earlier directed\u00a0national legal service authority to give\u00a0legal awareness and free consultation to the community for making most out of the legal safeguards provided to them.\nWith the perceived upward mobility of SCs, there has been a growing demand among dominant and upper castes to dilute PoA act like that of the demand by Marathas. This judgment can be used as a plank by these castes to further their agenda.\nReport of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes for 2015-16 states that there has been an increase in the number of incidence of atrocities but a decrease in conviction rates.\nNCRB data: The number of cases of atrocities against SC/St has increased from 2008 to 2016 but there was a decline in conviction rate at the same time.\nBut there are instances of misuse of the act by SC/STs, especially against public officials. This has lead to many bogus cases under PoA act. This claim has been validated by Parliamentary Standing Committee report, which has sought an inbuilt provision in the PoA act to safeguard those who are falsely accused.\nRecent Protests and the Review Petition against the Supreme Court Judgement\n\nThere was a national strike by Dalits against the judgment which turned violent leading to loss of lives. The Center has given review petition against the judgment. However, the Supreme Court has refused to keep in abeyance its earlier order preventing automatic arrests on complaints filed under the SC/ST Act.\n\nPolitical parties started blame-game and grandstanding, to make mileage out of the issue for 2019 elections. But amidst all this cacophony, the real issue should not be crowded out.\n\nPoA act is a transformative act and a \u2018Brahmastra\u2019 in the arsenal of hapless Dalits to fight their historically asymmetrical war of subjugation. It should be strengthened through proper implementation. But safeguards should also be inserted to protect innocents from being falsely persecuted. This could happen only through debates between all stakeholders.\n\nSubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs The State of Maharashtra judgment should be used as an opportunity to look into this dimension rather than weakening the act. But the most important thing for ending discrimination and improving fraternity is a persistent societal action to change the entrenched caste rigidity. SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (PoA act) as a tool in this endeavour rather than an end in itself.\n\nThough independent Indian state has introduced many measures to curb the atrocities and usher in socio-economic justice, the results are often not satisfactory. Legislations have been passed repeatedly on this subject is proof of the fact that the law alone cannot end this social practice.\n\nBy socio-cultural upliftment of SC/ST through their meaningful integration into society, by giving adequate capacity building opportunities through education, employment etc. must be the end of this struggle.\n\nReferences: Wikipedia, Indian Express, The Wire, The Hindu, Firstpost, Laxmikant\n\nArticle by: Sethu\u00a0Krishnan M"

Men are usually granted upper preferential status in matters of succession and inheritance. A uniform civil code will bring both men and women to par.\n\nTo accommodate the aspirations of the young population\n\nContemporary India is a new society with 55% of its population being below 25 years of age. Their social attitudes and aspirations are shaped by universal and global principles of equality, humanity, and modernity. Their view of shedding identity based on any religion has to be given serious consideration to utilize their full potential for nation-building.\n\nTo support the national integration\n\nAll Indian citizens are already equal before the court of law as the criminal laws and other civil laws (except personal laws) are the same for all. With the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code, all citizens will share the same set of personal laws. There will be no scope for politicization of issues of discrimination or concessions or special privileges enjoyed by a particular community based on their particular religious personal laws.\n\nTo bypass the contentious issue of reform of existing personal laws\n\nExisting personal laws are mainly based on the upper-class patriarchal notions of society in all religions. The demand of UCC is normally made by aggrieved women as a substitute for existing personal laws as patriarchal orthodox people still deem the reforms in personal laws will destroy their sanctity and oppose it profusely.\n\nWhat are the Cons of the Uniform Civil Code?\n\nPractical difficulties due to diversity in India\n\nIt is practically tough to come up with a common and uniform set of rules for personal issues like marriage due to the tremendous cultural diversity in India across religions, sects, castes, states, etc.\n\nRead:\u00a0Personal laws in India\n\nPerception of UCC as encroachment on religious freedom\n\nMany communities, particularly minority communities perceive Uniform Civil Code as an encroachment on their rights to religious freedom. They fear that a common code will neglect their traditions and impose rules that will be mainly dictated to and influenced by the majority of religious communities.\n\nInterference of state in personal matters\n\nThe constitution provides for the right to freedom of religion of one\u2019s choice. With the codification of uniform rules and its compulsion, the scope of the freedom of religion will be reduced.\n\nSensitive and tough task\n\nSuch a code, in its true spirit, must be brought about by borrowing freely from different personal laws, making gradual changes in each, issuing judicial pronouncements assuring gender equality, and adopting expansive interpretations on marriage, maintenance, adoption, and succession by acknowledging the benefits that one community secures from the others. This task will be a very demanding time and human resource-wise. The government should be sensitive and unbiased at each step while dealing with the majority and minority communities. Otherwise, it might turn out to be more disastrous in the form of communal violence.\n\nTime is not yet suitable for this reform\n\nConsidering the major opposition from the Muslim community in India over this issue overlapping with controversies over beef, saffronization of school and college curriculum, love jihad, and the silence emanating from the top leadership on these controversies, there needs to be given sufficient time for instilling confidence in the community. Otherwise, these efforts towards common will be counterproductive leaving the minority class particularly Muslims more insecure and vulnerable to get attracted towards fundamentalist and extremist ideologies.\n\nConclusion\nAt the end of the day, a UCC can only emerge through an evolutionary process, which preserves India\u2019s rich legal heritage, of which all the personal laws are equal constituents.\nThe codification and implementation of UCC may not necessarily usher in the expected equality among genders and religions.\nMajor sensitization efforts are needed to reform current personal law reforms which should first be initiated by the communities themselves.\nCurrent institutions need to be modernized, democratized and strengthened for this change. Sincere efforts towards women\u2019s empowerment have to be taken for all women of all religions.\nThe plural democracy is an identity of modern India. Therefore, efforts should be focused on harmony in plurality rather than blanket uniformity for a flourishing Indian democracy.\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Manjiri Mulye."

Indian Economy was weak as it had high Fiscal Deficit, high Revenue Deficit, and high Debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\nBy 2003, the continuous government borrowing and the resultant debt had severely impacted the health of the Indian economy. Much of the borrowing was utilized for interest payments of previous borrowings, but not for productive-purposes. This resulted in interest payments becoming the largest expenditure item of the government.\n\nMany economists then warned the government that this condition is not sustainable.

Hence in 2000, they introduced a bill to bring responsibility and discipline in matters of expenditure and debt. This bill was passed by the Indian Parliament in 2003 and came to be known as the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.\u00a0\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill (FRBM Bill) was introduced in India by the then Finance Minister of India, Mr.Yashwant Sinha in December 2000. The provisions provided in the initial versions of the bill were too drastic. After much discussions, a watered-down version of the bill was passed in 2003 to become the FRBM Act. The FRBM Rules came into force from July 5, 2004.\n\nWhat is the FRBM Act all about?\n\nFRBM Act is all about maintaining a balance between Government revenue and government expenditure.\n\nThe intention of the\u00a0Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act was\u00a0to bring \u2013\n\nfiscal discipline.\nefficient management of expenditure, revenue and debt.\nmacroeconomic stability.\nbetter coordination between fiscal and monetary policy.\ntransparency in the fiscal operation of the Government.\nachieving a balanced budget.\nObjectives of the FRBM Act\n\nThe main objectives of the act were:\n\nto introduce transparent fiscal management systems in the country.\nto introduce a more equitable and manageable distribution of the country\u2019s debts over the years.\nto aim for fiscal stability for India in the long run\n\nAdditionally, the act was expected to give the necessary flexibility to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for managing inflation in India.\n\nProvisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act\n\nThe FRBM rules mandate four fiscal indicators to be projected in the medium-term fiscal policy statement. These are:\n\nrevenue deficit as a percentage of GDP\nfiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP.\ntax revenue as a percentage of GDP.\ntotal outstanding liabilities as a percentage of GDP.\n\nThe FRBM Act set targets for fiscal deficit and revenue deficit.\n\nThe FRBM act also provided for certain documents to be tabled in the Parliament of India, along with Budget, annually with regards to the country\u2019s fiscal policy. This included the Medium-term Fiscal Policy Statement, Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement, Macro-economic Framework Statement, and Medium-term Expenditure Framework Statement. For details check the details of the budget documents.\n\nInitial FRBM Targets (to be met by 2008-09)\nRevenue Deficit Target \u2013 revenue deficit should be completely eliminated by March 31, 2009. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.5% of GDP.\nFiscal Deficit Target \u2013 fiscal deficit should be reduced to 3% of GDP by March 31, 2009. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.3% of GDP.\nContingent Liabilities \u2013 The Central Government shall not give incremental guarantees aggregating an amount exceeding 0.5 per cent of GDP in any financial year beginning 2004-05.\nAdditional Liabilities \u2013\u00a0 Additional liabilities (including external debt at current exchange rate) should be reduced to 9% of the GDP by 2004-05. The minimum annual reduction target in each subsequent year to be 1% of GDP.\nRBI purchase of government bonds \u2013 to cease from 1 April 2006. This indicates the government not to borrow directly from the RBI.\nDid the government meet the FRBM targets by March 2009?\n\nNo. Implementing the act, the government had managed to cut the fiscal deficit to 2.7% of GDP and revenue deficit to 1.1% of GDP in 2007\u201308. However, the targets were not met.\n\nThe global financial crisis (2007-08) led the government to infuse resources in the economy as the fiscal stimulus in 2008. Therefore, fiscal targets had to be postponed temporarily in view of the global crisis.\n\nAmendments in the FRBM Act\n\nIn 2012 and 2015, notable amendments were made, resulting in relaxation of target realisation year.\n\nA new concept called Effective Revenue Deficit (E.R.D) was also introduced.\n\nThe requirement of \u2018Medium Term Expenditure Framework Statement\u2019 was also added via amendment in FRBMA.\n\nFRBM Targets after Amendment to FRBM Act in 2012 (to be achieved by 2015)\nRevenue Deficit Target \u2013\u00a0revenue deficit should be completely eliminated by March 31, 2015. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.5% of GDP.\nFiscal Deficit Target \u2013 fiscal deficit should be reduced to 3% of GDP by March 31, 2015.\u00a0The minimum annual reduction target was 0.3% of GDP.\nFRBM Targets after Amendment to FRBM Act in 2015 (to be achieved by 2018)\nRevenue Deficit Target \u2013\u00a0revenue deficit should be completely eliminated by March 31, 2018. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.5% of GDP.\nFiscal Deficit Target \u2013 fiscal deficit should be reduced to 3% of GDP by March 31, 2018.\u00a0The minimum annual reduction target was 0.3% of GDP.\nFRBM Review Committee headed by NK Singh: Recommendations\n\nThe government believed the targets were too rigid.\n\nIn May 2016, the government set up a committee under NK Singh to review the FRBM Act. The committee recommended that the government should target a fiscal deficit of 3 per cent of the GDP in years up to March 31, 2020, cut it to 2.8 per cent in 2020-21 and to 2.5 per cent by 2023.\n\nThe Committee suggested using debt as the primary target for fiscal policy. This ratio was 70% in 2017.\n\nThese are the targets set by NK Singh:\n\nDebt to GDP ratio: The review committee advocated for a Debt to GDP ratio of 60% to be targeted with a 40% limit for the centre and 20% limit for the states.\nRevenue Deficit Target \u2013\u00a0revenue deficit should be reduced to 0.8% of GDP by March 31, 2023. The minimum annual reduction target was 0.5% of GDP.\nFiscal Deficit Target \u2013 fiscal deficit should be reduced to 2.5% of GDP by March 31, 2023.\u00a0The minimum annual reduction target was 0.3% of GDP.\nLatest FRBM Targets\n\nThe latest provisions of the FRBM act requires the government to limit the fiscal deficit to 3% of the GDP by March 31, 2021, and the debt of the central government to 40% of the GDP by 2024-25, among others.\n\nThe Act provides room for deviation from the annual fiscal deficit target under certain conditions.\n\nEscape Clause in the FRBM Act\n\nEscape clause refers to the situation under which the central government can flexibly follow fiscal deficit target during special circumstances. This terminology was innovated by the NK Singh Committee on FRBM.\n\nIn Budget 2017, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley deferred the fiscal deficit target of 3% of the GDP and chose a target of 3.2%, citing the NK Singh committee report.\n\nHowever, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) pulled up the government for deferring the targets which it said should have been done through amending the Act.\n\nIn 2018, the FRBM Act was further amended. Specific details were updated in sub-section (2) of Section 4. The clause allows the govt to relax the fiscal deficit target for up to 50 basis points or 0.5 per cent. Under FRBM, if the escape clause is triggered to allow for a breach of fiscal deficit target, the RBI is then allowed to participate directly in the primary auction of government bonds, thus formalising deficit financing.\n\nThe Escape Clauses can be invoked:\n\nby the Government after formal consultations and advice of the Fiscal Council.\nwith a clear commitment to return to the original fiscal target in the coming fiscal year.\n\nIn 2020, Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman used the escape clause provided under the FRBM Act to allow the relaxation of the target. Finance Minister revised the fiscal deficit for FY20 to 3.8 per cent and pegged the target for FY21 to 3.5 per cent.\n\nNote: The Act exempts the government from following the FRBM guidelines in case of war or calamity.\n\nWhat is the current status of Fiscal Deficit and Revenue Deficit?\n\nFiscal Deficit (FD)- The Fiscal deficit as per the Indian Budget 2020-21 was estimated 3.5 % of GDP.\nRevenue Deficit (RD)- The Revenue Deficit as per the Indian Budget 2020-21 was estimated 2.7 % of GDP.\nEffective Revenue Deficit (ERD)- The effective revenue deficit as per the Indian Budget 2020-21 was estimated 1.8 % of GDP.\nTax to GDP ratio: 10.8\nDebt to GDP ratio (Central Government): 50.1\nWhat if there is no Fiscal Discipline?\n\nIf there is no fiscal discipline, the government (executive) may spend as it wishes.\n\nA country is just like a house; if the expenditure is too much and if there is no revenue to balance the high expenditure, the country will eventually fall into a debt trap, which may finally result in its collapse.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe FRBM Act seeks to achieve long-term macroeconomic stability, while generating budget surpluses, prudential debt management, limiting borrowings to cut down deficits and debt, greater transparency, removal of fiscal impediments and providing a medium-term framework for budgetary implementation.\n\nAs seen in the above analysis, different governments have failed to achieve the FRBM targets set to be achieved in 2008 even by 2020.\n\nThough the Act aims to achieve deficit reductions prima facie, an important objective is to achieve inter-generational equity in fiscal management. This is because when there are high borrowings today, it should be repaid by the future generation. But the benefit from high expenditure and debt today goes to the present generation.\n\nAchieving FRBM targets thus ensures inter-generation equity by reducing the debt burden of the future generation."

            "[CONTENT]": "The National Security Act (NSA) in existence for more than four decades has been questioned for its draconian effects and its potential misuse. Read further to know more.\n\nRecently some state governments have invoked the National Security Act to detain citizens for questionable offenses.\n\nIn this post, we shall learn and analyze the National Security Act in detail.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistorical Background\nProvisions of the National Security Act 1980\nGrounds of Detention\nConstitution of Advisory Board\nProtective Measures\nCriticism of the National Security Act\nConclusion\nHistorical Background\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nIndia is one of the few countries in the world whose constitution allows for preventive detention during peacetime. Article 22 (3) says that the rights available to an arrested person will not be applicable in case of preventive detention.\n\nThe National Security Act (NSA) has its roots in preventive detention laws. The first iteration of these laws was framed during British rule. However, post-independence these laws were carried forward as the Preventive Detention Act of 1950. This was replaced by the Maintenance of Internal Security Act of 1971 and finally the National Security Act of 1980.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nProvisions of the National Security Act 1980\nNSA empowers the Centre or a State government to detain a person so that he does not act in any manner prejudicial to national security. The person need not be charged during the period of detention.\nAn individual can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months.\nThe detained person can be held for 10 days without being told the charges against him.\nGrounds of Detention\nActing in any manner prejudicial to the defense of India, the relations of India with foreign powers, or the security of India.\nRegulating the continued presence of any foreigner in India or making arrangements for his expulsion from India.\nPreventing them from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State or from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community it is necessary so to do.\nConstitution of Advisory Board\nThe central or state government shall constitute one or more Advisory Boards.\nIt consists of three persons who are qualified to be appointed as Judges of a High Court.\nThe grounds of detention must be placed before the Advisory Board within 3 weeks from the date of detention.\nThe detained person can appeal before the Advisory Board but they are not allowed a lawyer during the trial.\nIf the Advisory Board finds no sufficient cause for the detention, the government shall revoke the detention order and release the person.\nProtective Measures\nNo suit or other legal proceeding shall lie against the Central or State Governments, or any other person, for anything in good faith done or intended to be done in pursuance of this Act.\n\nAlso read: India\u2019s Intelligence and Investigation Agencies\n\nCriticism of the National Security Act\nArticle 22 and various provisions of Cr.PC safeguard the interests of an arrested person.\nThe person arrested has to be informed of the grounds of arrest.\nThe arrested person cannot be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.\nThe arrested person should be produced before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours.\nHowever, none of these safeguards are available if a person is detained under NSA.\nA person could be kept in the dark about the reasons for his arrest for up to 10 days.\nEven when providing the grounds for arrest, the government can withhold information which it considers to be against the public interest to disclose.\nThe arrested person is also not entitled to the aid of any legal practitioner in any matter connected with the proceedings before an advisory board, which is constituted by the government.\nDetaining someone without trial during normal times is hard to justify when it is difficult to prove the legitimacy of the threat posed by the person.\nWhile it is true that Constitution provides for Article 22 (3) that does not extend safeguards of the criminal system to preventive detention, the justification for persisting with the same provisions even 70 years after independence needs to be reviewed.\nSince the NSA allows custody of people without framing a charge, it has become a convenient tool for the government and police to circumvent the formalities of the Criminal Procedure Code and the courts of the land.\nThe police make use of the NSA when they are unwilling or unable to make a criminal case. Instances of journalists critical of the establishment being charged with NSA are becoming common.\nRather than for stopping future crimes, NSA is often used as a response to ordinary law and order cases. The NSA morphs into a punitive measure in such instances.\nThe vague language of the law means NSA is being used for the detention of individuals based on the government\u2019s satisfaction that an individual is a threat to foreign relations, national security, public order, or the maintenance of essential supplies and services. Thus, theoretically, the government can invoke the NSA if an individual\u2019s act threatens to disrupt public order like causing a commotion or obstructing traffic.\n\nAlso read: How can Technology be used in Law Enforcement?\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are no separate figures currently available for detentions under the NSA. The 177th Law Commission Report of 2001 reveals that 14,57,779 persons were arrested under preventive provisions in India. It is paramount to review the continued usage of the NSA and to close the loopholes that permit law enforcement to abuse constitutional and statutory rights.\n\nPreventive detention must not be used for regular law and order issues.\n\nThe endeavor must be to guard liberty \u2013 one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nRead:\u00a0National Security Strategy"

Civil Servants being permanent executives, they advise political executives. They also assist the ministers to formulate and execute policies. In this post, we shall see in particular the functions of an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of Indian Administrative Service (IAS)\nAll India Services\nFunctions of an IAS officer\nDesignations held by IAS officers during field posting\nAppointments to other Organizations / Bodies\nDesignations during Posting in Secretariat of State Government/\u00a0Central Government\nRegulations Governing IAS\nHistory of Indian Administrative Service (IAS)\n\nIndian Administrative Service (IAS) is one of the premier services of Government of India. IAS was\u00a0constituted in 1946. Prior to that Indian Imperial Service (1893-1946) was in force.\n\nThe basic pattern of the cadre system in the Civil Service was established following the recommendations of the Aitchison Commission.\u00a0Provincial Civil Service constituted in the 1890s was also on the basis of the recommendations of the Aitchison Commission.\u00a0In 1912 the Islington commission was appointed to study Civil Service reforms.

The first part of the training is called the \u201cFoundation Course\u201d or FC. This is a 100-day training program.\n\nF.C. is compulsory only for IAS, IFS, IFoS and IPS. It is optional for other services of Group A. Group B services are not made to attend it.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nLong back when the number of selected candidates and services used to be less, all services used to attend Foundation Course (FC) at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA). Now candidates selected by UPSC undergoes FC at different academies including LBSNAA.\n\nThe Foundation Course, a combination of activities carried out at the academy, consists of academic components such as public administration, law and political science, besides a number of extra-curricular activities such as trekking, village visits and interaction with fellow probationers.\n\nAt present, the Foundation Course counts for 400 marks, but, along with the other phases of the probation period, only goes towards establishing seniority within the batch.\n\nDoPT writes to all cadre-controlling ministries\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Office wants that besides the marks scored in the UPSC Civil Services Exam, the probationers for IAS, IPS or IFS should be allocated service or cadre after reviewing their performance in the foundation course.\n\nDoPT, under the ministry of personnel has written a letter to all cadre-controlling ministries seeking their opinion on the issue saying the PMO wants to change the rules from this year itself.\n\nItems to be examined:\n\nIf service allocation/cadre allocation to probationers selected on the basis of the civil services examination be made after Foundation Course.\nThe feasibility of giving due weightage to the performance in the Foundation Course and making service allocation as well as cadre allocation to All India Services Officers, based on the combined score obtained in the civil services examination and the Foundation course.\nWhat\u2019s is good about the new IAS/IPS Allocation Proposal? (if any)?\n\nA lot of newly selected civil servants take the foundation course as just a formality because they know that they have been allocated cadre and services. When their marks and rank in UPSC and performance in foundation course will be at stake, they will take those three months seriously.\n\nWhat is bad about the new IAS/IPS Allocation Proposal?\n\nThere are many problems with the new proposal. A few are listed below.\n\nIf the Government tries to take the control and authority of selection and recruitment from the independent agency \u2013 UPSC \u2013 it can be interpreted as violation of the principles of Constitution (Article 311 \u2013 315).\nIf the service and the cadre allocation are determined on the combined score of the civil services examination and the score or performance of the foundation course, it will dilute the role of UPSC by increasing the interference of the executive.\nService allocation after foundation course will have tremendous potential for misuse. There can be a lot of political pressure on the faculties, and academy directors to select bureaucracy loyal to the ruling government.\nIf the PMO\u2019s latest proposal is accepted, it will theoretically be possible for a candidate whose rank in the UPSC civil services examination can get him only into, say, the Indian Defence Accounts Service, to climb up to the coveted Indian Administrative Service on the basis of how well he does his foundation course.\nIf a person who has studied hard for years to get top rankings in the UPSC exam somehow performs low in the 3-month foundation course, and if she is denied the cadre and service wanted or deserved, then it would be unfair for him/her.\nA single academy cannot accommodate all 1000 candidates at a time for the foundation course.\nThe papers, the subjects, the faculty, and also the overall standards are different for different foundation courses. As result, there would be a lot of arbitrariness in something as crucial as service allocation for which candidates put in so much effort\nIt is also unhealthy to make the probationers compete from day one of their foundation course; the camaraderie among them will be lost.\nThe current government has already made so many crucial changes or proposals in the way top bureaucrats are selected.\u00a0 Reducing the importance of CSAT (aptitude) paper, proposal for lateral entry into civil services, introduction of zones above the cadres, proposal to reduce age limit as per Baswan committee reports etc \u2013 being some of them.\nIs the New IAS/IPS Allocation Proposal practical?\n\nThe move has already caused outrage among retired, serving and aspiring civil servants. Many believe that\u00a0the new move will do no good but destroy the existing system.\n\nHowever, to implement the IAS/IPS allocation policy will not be easy.\n\nFirst, there are many candidates who skip the Foundation Course every year, to attempt the UPSC Civil Services Exam again. If that is the case, how can the foundation marks be added to find the final ranks in a year is a big question.\n\nSecond, the rules of allocation based on UPSC CSE 2017 was already published. Induction to every service is as per laid down recruitment rules. The recruitment rules will have to be amended if this move is to be formalized. It might lead to many court case if government alter the same for this year. Not only this, UPSC has published the notification for Civil Services Exam 2018, and candidates are not pre-informed about any change in the final allocation process.\n\nShould Civil Service Aspirants worry about the new IAS/IPS Allocation Proposal?\n\nMinister of State for personnel Jitendra Singh said: \u201cThere was a suggestion to this effect which has been followed up by eliciting the views of all stakeholders. At present, the issue is still in the consultation stage. There is nothing more to it.\u201d\n\nThe government is only exploring the option and has hence invited views and suggestions of the cadre-controlling ministries, to see if the option is feasible.\n\nNothing much should be read into it as of now."

            "[CONTENT]": "Lateral entry into Civil Services refers to the recruitment of professionals from the private sector, academia, or other fields directly into higher echelons of government bureaucracy. This approach is aimed at infusing fresh perspectives, specialized skills, and expertise that might be lacking within the traditional cadre of civil servants.

India ranks 76 in the Corruption Perception Index brought by Transparency International. It also mentions that India has the highest incidence of bribery in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe Political and Economic Consultancy Report rated Indian bureaucracy as the slowest among its 12 Asian counterparts. Such indices and reports are a manifestation of the retrograde bureaucracy of India and its unprogressive performance, urging immediate rejuvenation.\n\nAn Analysis of the Recent Steps for Lateral Entry into Civil Services\n\nSeveral steps have been taken by the current government to enhance the qualitative value of civil servants in India. One among them is the instruction issued by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office to the Department of Personnel and Training to prepare a memorandum on the induction of outsiders in the middle rung of ministries that deal with the economy and infrastructure.\n\nThis announcement has caused an upheaval of speculations in both the political and administrative circles of the country. As rightly pointed out by Honorable Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor in the Question Hour of Lok Sabha, there are underlying vacancies in different departments of multiple ministries and also inefficiencies in the existing system of complacent bureaucracy. The government has to take leapfrogging measures to arrive at a political consensus for reforms in bureaucracy.\n\nAccording to some sources, the shortlisting of private sector executives or social workers would be through a matrix of experience and qualifications, without taking into account their current salaries.\nThe final selection committee would be headed by the Cabinet Secretary.\nAs per preliminary estimates, 40 individuals such as entrepreneurs, academicians, and social workers would be selected to the middle management level.\nNotably, there would be no entry of such officials in the Ministry of Home, Defence, Personnel, and Corporate Affairs.\nNeed for lateral entry into Civil Services\nThe assurance of a secure career path has been held to be the career-based system\u2019s biggest lacuna.\nThis weakness has been compounded by a heavy reliance on seniority, an inadequate annual reporting system, and frequent transfers (Reference: Indian Express).\nIt has discouraged initiative by reducing competition in the higher echelons of government.\nAllegedly, the quasi-monopolistic hold of the career civil services in senior management positions breeds complacency, inhibits innovative thinking and prevents the inflow of new ideas from outside government.\nThere is a huge shortfall in several recruits, such as a 20% shortage of IAS officers in 24 state cadres of India.\nThe Baswan Committee has pointed out the huge deficit of officers. The government has in March 2017, informed that there is a shortage of over 1,400 IAS and 900 IPS officers in the country. While the total strength should be 6,396 Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers, however, there are only 4926 officers in the country.\nThere is an unwillingness among officers of the state to undertake Centre deputation.\nCounter-arguments over Lateral Entry into Civil Services\nThe All India Services provide a unique link between the cutting edge at the field level and top policy-making positions as has also been mentioned by the First Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) and by the Sarkaria Commission.\nThis bridge between policy-making and implementation, while crucial to all systems, has been of strategic significance in the Indian context, given the regional diversity of the country.\nThe exposure and sensitivity to the country\u2019s complex socio-political milieu and to the needs of the common man, which widespread field experience provides to these Services, may not be available in the private sector since the private sector does not have the same width and depth of exposure to this type of field experience.\nLateral entry only at top-level policy-making positions may have little impact on field-level implementation, given the multiple links in the chain of command from the Union Government to a rural village.\nLack of sufficient and suitable talent in the private sector.\nOperational difficulties of fresh recruitment for a Senior Executive Service (SES).\nThe possible adverse impact of such recruitment on the constitutional mandate for affirmative action as a result of the creation of a new recruitment channel at a senior level.\nAn issue of conflict of interest when it comes to entrants from the private sector.\nThe potential loss of internal talent as well as the likelihood of atrophy of the existing career-based services.\nHow do other Countries Operate?\n\nCareer-Based Senior Executive Service (SES)\n\nFound in India, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Spain.\nRecruitment at the entry-level through competitive examinations.\nThey are trained and groomed to become elite corps and then put on an accelerated career trajectory.\nThe advantage of its closed nature is that there is a common culture and value system, and an enviable degree of esprit de corps, a combination that facilitates excellent communication across the governmental spectrum.\n\nPosition-based Senior Executive Service (SES)\n\nFound in Australia, Belgium, New Zealand, UK, USA, Netherlands.\nThe appointments to identified senior positions are made from a wider pool comprising all civil servants who are qualified to apply as well as those applicants from the private sector with relevant domain competency and experience.\nIts openness is its basic strength. All professional cadres in the government and even those outside the government can compete for selected top positions.\nThis makes it possible for lateral entrants to bring in their own work culture which enables renewal and adaptiveness in government organizations.\nHowever, the bulk of appointments in the position-based system is from among career civil servants.\nIn the American SES, only 10% of the positions are filled up by \u201coutsiders\u201d. In Australia, recruitment to the SES from outside the Australian Public Service has ranged from 25% in 1992-93 to 14% in 2000-01. 20% of Korea\u2019s career-based SES is now recruited from the open market.\nComparison\nCareer management is more decentralized in the position-based system as compared with the career-based system.\nWhile members of the career-based SES are employed from the time of recruitment to the age of retirement, the position-based SES is based on contracts.\nIn both cases, performance standards are stipulated in advance and appraised rigorously.\nFirst Administrative Reforms Commission inputs\n\nThe first Administrative Reforms Commission while examining the whole issue of Personnel administration concerning the higher management positions in the Government of India, had distinguished between two categories of senior management posts, viz,\n\nPosts within the functional area should be staffed by the relevant functional cadre.\nPosts outside the functional area for which the required functional experience may be available in the All India Services, the Central Services, and among specialists like engineers, scientists, economists, etc.\n\nThe Commission went on to recommend that the level of Joint Secretary and Additional Secretary in senior management, outside the purely functional posts, \u201cthe areas of specialism will broaden out and it should be possible, and it is necessary to provide for mobility from one specialism to an allied specialism.\n\nAt the highest level of Special Secretary or Secretary and equivalent in Central Government, the factor that should count most is one\u2019s general managerial competence\u201d.\n\nSixth Central Pay Commission inputs\nFor creating a senior management or leadership pool in the Government of India, competition can be infused through two main mechanisms: a) opening up the senior management cadre to all existing Services, and b) lateral entry by opening the senior management cadre to aspirants from the private sector who can bring new skills into government.\nLateral entry into civil services as done in the past on an ad hoc basis is not a suitable model of manpower planning since the incumbents in government departments tend to resist entry of outside talent and the whole process remains personality-driven and inchoate.\nNeed to institutionalize the process of induction of outside talent into the government.\nLateral entries should be done at the present level of Additional Secretary / HAG which is a leadership position from which one can aspire to reach the rank of Secretary to Government.\nThese posts involve leadership rather than purely operational roles and issues such as the requirement of greater functional/ technical knowledge at operational levels.\nCentral Civil Services Authority should be entrusted with the task of identifying the posts at the higher management level, HAG and above, where induction of outside talent would be desirable.\nSuch posts could then be opened for recruitment by tapping talent both from within and outside the government through a transparent process to be implemented by the Authority.\nRecommendations from the 10th Administrative Reforms Committee report\nThe present empanelment system for short-listing officers for posting at the Senior Administrative Grade (SAG) level and above should be replaced by a more transparent and objective placement procedure.\nAt higher levels of government, it is necessary to ensure that the tasks assigned to a public servant match his/her domain competence as well as aptitude and potential.\nMinistries should classify all of their SAG-level posts according to their relevant functional domains.\nThere is a need to introduce competition for senior positions in government by opening these positions in Government to all Services.\nA Central Civil Services Authority should be constituted under the proposed Civil Services Bill. It shall be a five-member body consisting of the Chairperson and four members.\nThe Central Civil Services Authority should deal with matters of\nassignment of domains to officers,\npreparing panels for the posting of officers at the level of Joint Secretary and above,\nfixing tenures for senior posts,\ndeciding on posts that could be advertised for lateral entry into civil services and\nsuch other matters that may be referred to it by the Government.\nIn news\n\nAugust 2024: The Central government directed the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to withdraw its advertisement issued three days ago, seeking applications for lateral recruitment to senior bureaucratic posts at the Centre.\n\nOpposition party leaders had criticised the policy for not having reservations for Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) candidates.\nConclusion: Is lateral Entry into Civil Services needed or not?\n\nThe recruitment in the lateral entry can be done for specific mission-mode projects. Eg, Nandan Nilekani for the Aadhaar Project.\nTransparent recruitment as per recommendations of the 10th ARC report to ensure clearly defined service rules and accountability.\nNorms should be liberalized for civil servants to work outside the government with multilateral agencies, nonprofits or corporations.\n\nArticle by: Mausam Bharati"

Senkumar, sending out a clear message that police officers cannot be made \u201cscapegoats\u201d by politicians in power.\n\nThe decision is likely to have repercussions in States were police chiefs were removed by the political dispensation against the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Prakash Singh\u00a0Case (we will be discussing the same below) that DGP should have a fixed tenure of two years and not be subject to the whims of the political powers in the State.\n\nRole of Police in a Parliamentary Democracy\n\nThere is no doubt that police have a vital role in a parliamentary democracy. The police ensure safety and security of the society. The rate and complexity of the crime have increased over the years adding new dimensions to the responsibilities of police. The present Indian police system is largely a legacy of the British rule in India since it is based on the Police Act of 1861.\n\nA.H.L Fraser Commission\n\nA.H.L Fraser, the chairman of the commission appointed by the British in 1902 said:\n\nThe police force is far from efficient, it is defective in training and organizing, it is inadequately supervised, it is generally regarded as corrupt, oppressive and it utterly failed to secure the confidence and cordial cooperation of the people.\n\nSince 1902, little has changed. The functions of the police during the British time are different from the functions that are to be performed after the independence. After independence, India had adopted the most inclusive and comprehensive constitution to ensure the welfare of the citizens but the institution of police which is responsible for implementing the law and order was not overhauled.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPolice is a State Subject\nPolice is an exclusive state subject and the center has its limitations in this regard.\nAfter independence, some states came out with their own police acts.\nFor example, the Bombay Police act, 1951; the Kerala Police act 1960; the Delhi Police act, 1978.\n\nHowever, all of these police acts were a replica of the Indian police act, 1861. This has in extreme situations made the situation of guardian turning predator and the confidence of the people has come down.\n\nNational Police Committee, 1978\nThis was the first commission at the national level after independence.\nIt had wide terms of reference covering the police organization, its role, functionality, accountability, relations with the public etc.\n\nThis committee gave a comprehensive report and recommended to bring an autonomous body of organization which could be accountable to people. However, the major recommendations of this committee were not accepted by the government.\n\nImportant Case: Prakash Singh and others vs the Union of India (1995)\n\nIn 1995, Prakash Singh, former DGP of Uttar Pradesh filed a PIL regarding police reforms in India.\nThis led to the government constituting a new committee under the chairmanship of Julio Ribeiro, and the Julio Ribeiro Committee was formed in 1998.\nThis was followed by further committees like Padmanabhaiah, Malimath committee, Soli Sorabjee committee.\nIn 2006, since there were no movements in the direction of reforms, the Supreme Court made the police reforms a mandatory reform to be taken up by the central and state governments.\nThe Seven Directives by Supreme Court (2006)\n\nThe apex court gave its nearly revolutionary directions in 2006, a decade after Mr. Singh first filed his petition. The states and union territories were directed to comply with seven binding directives that would kick-start reform.\n\n1) Directive One\n\nConstitute a State Security Commission (SSC) to:\n\n\u00a0Ensure that the state government does not exercise unwarranted influence or pressure on the police.\nLay down broad policy guideline.\nEvaluate the performance of the state police.\n2) Directive Two\nEnsure that the DGP is appointed through the merit-based transparent process and secure a minimum tenure of two years.\n3) Directive Three\nEnsure that other police officers on operational duties (including Superintendents of Police in-charge of a district and Station House Officers in-charge of a police station) are also provided a minimum tenure of two years.\n4) Directive Four\nSeparate the investigation and law and order functions of the police.\n5) Directive Five\nSet up a Police Establishment Board (PEB) to decide transfers, postings, promotions and other service related matters of police officers of and below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police and make recommendations on postings and transfers above the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police.\n6) Directive Six\nSet up a Police Complaints Authority (PCA) at state level to inquire into public complaints against police officers of and above the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police in cases of serious misconduct, including custodial death, grievous hurt, or rape in police custody and at district levels to inquire into public complaints against the police personnel below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police in cases of serious misconduct.\n7) Directive Seven\nSet up a National Security Commission (NSC) at the union level to prepare a panel for selection and placement of Chiefs of the Central Police Organizations (CPO) with a minimum tenure of two years.\n\nAfter this, 14 states have passed legislation but these were mainly to circumvent the directives but not to implement them. Till today, the government has not shown its commitment to follow the directives of the court in true letter and spirit.\n\n\u201cPolice reforms are going on and on. Nobody listens to our orders.\u201d \u2013 Supreme Court\n\n\u201cPolice reforms are going on and on. Nobody listens to our orders.\u201d This is how a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice J.S. Khehar reacted while declining the plea of a lawyer demanding immediate action to usher in major police reforms in the country (March 2017). The lawyer had earlier been permitted to implead himself in a pending PIL on the subject.\n\nIt is sad that the highest court of the land is so helpless in the matter.\n\nT P Senkumar Case\n\nT P Senkumar \u2013 DGP of Kerala \u2013 was transferred by the Left Democratic Front government led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to the Kerala Police Housing and Construction Ltd as its chairman and managing director. Lokanath Behara had replaced him as the new DGP.\n\nThough it may be argued that the government has the right to appoint a DGP of its choice, but Senkumar had argued that the case against him reeked of arbitrariness and was a result of his fair and efficient probe in the cases of political murders in the state, wherein some leaders of the present government were found to be accused.\n\nIn a major verdict, the Supreme Court\u00a0ordered the Kerala government to restore the services of ousted DGP T P Senkumar holding that his removal was arbitrary and not as per established law.\u00a0It\u2019s rare for the apex court to interfere in such appointments and the ruling has led to a debate on judicial overreach.\n\nWhy do we need police reforms?\nThe security of the society and the welfare of the people is dependent on the efficiency of the police.\nTo eliminate the undue political interference which led to the loss of autonomy of police. The police of today are victims of politicization as well as criminalization.\nTo instill the confidence of the people in the institution of police by making police more people friendly\nTo prevent the highhandedness of police in the form of extra-judicial killings. Recently NHRC noted that 206 cases of encounters occurred in the last 12 months\nTo continue security and growth with our high economic growth, the maintenance of law and order plays a vital role.\n\nThe recent example of Haryana police during the Jat reservation riots either due to inherent caste bias or hesitation of not getting support by the people further stresses the need for reforms.\n\nChallenges and solutions\nChallenges like police training and quantity of force along with the quality, the long working hours as well as the isolation of police force from the public in the form of separate living quarters should be looked into.\nPolice should be made an integral part the society they live in.\nPolice reforms should no longer be delayed and the civil society should play its role for faster action by the government.\nSummary\n\nThe nation can no longer afford a politician\u2019s police and it\u2019s time for people\u2019s police.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s directions on police reforms have not been complied with in letter and spirit by any state. Many states have enacted laws to legitimise the status quo and circumvent the implementation of the Court\u2019s directions. Some states have passed executive orders which dilute or amend the SC\u2019s directions. No wonder the Justice Thomas committee, which was set up to monitor the implementation of the Court\u2019s directions, expressed a sense of \u201cdismay\u201d over the indifference to judicial directions.\n\nThe verdict in TP Senkumar case was in continuation of the Prakash Singh case that would be applicable to all the States. It\u2019s high time that the states should obey the Supreme Court directives. Urgent steps should be taken by all states to set up police complaints authority, Security Commission and separate the law and order and investigation wings.\n\nArticle by:\u00a0P.

It is up to the centre and the states to specify the classes that belong to this group. However, it is understood that classes that are not represented adequately in the services of the state can be termed backward classes. Further, the President can, under Art. 340, can constitute a commission to investigate the condition of socially and educationally backward classes.

Thus, the state is required to provide school education to children.\n\nIn the case of Unni Krishnan vs State of AP, SC held that the right to education for children between 6 to 14 years of age is a fundamental right as it flows from the Right to Life. After this decision, education was made a fundamental right explicitly through the 86th Amendment in 2002.\n\nArt. 24: Children have a fundamental right against exploitation and it is prohibited to employ children below 14 years of age in factories and any hazardous processes. Recently the list of hazardous processes has been updated to include domestic, hotel, and restaurant work.\n\nSeveral PILs have been filed for the benefit of children.

            "[CONTENT]": "Jallikattu is a bull taming event practiced in Tamil Nadu as a part of Pongal celebrations. Jallikattu is recently in news because of the Supreme Court rulings, Government interventions and agitations from the public against the Jallikattu ban. In this post, let\u2019s analyze, Jallikattu and other important issues associated with it in detail.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Jallikattu?\nWhat is the history of Jallikattu?\nWhy PETA and other animal rights activists want to ban Jallikattu?\nJudgments on Jallikattu\nSupporters arguments for continuing Jallikattu\nWhat are the recent policies of India on Animal Advocacy?\nConclusion\nWhat is Jallikattu?\n\nJallikattu is a sport conducted as a part of Mattu Pongal (the 3rd day of the four-day long harvest, Pongal).\nJallikattu is also known as eru thazhuvuthal\u00a0or\u00a0manju virattu.\nThe Tamil word \u2018Mattu\u2019 means bull and the 3rd day of Pongal is dedicated to cattle. Bulls get precedence over cows because it helps in the ploughing of field, pulling their cart of goods and mating with cows to produce more offspring and in turn more production of milk.\nBulls are brought to a common place where the ritual happens. The participants are supposed to embrace the bull\u2019s hump and try to tame it by bringing the bull to a stop.\nJallikattu is derived from the words \u2018calli\u2019 (coins) and \u2018kattu\u2019 (tie), which means a bundle of coins is tied to the bull\u2019s horns. In older times, the tamer sought to remove this bundle from the animal\u2019s head to win gold or silver. He would be called \u2018brave\u2019 and \u2018valourous\u2019 and would also sometimes be rewarded with a bride.\nWhat is the history of Jallikattu?\n\n\u00a0Jalikattu is believed to have been practiced since at least 2500 years.\nA seal from Indus Valley civilization depicting the practice is preserved in the National Museum, New Delhi.\nA cave painting that depicts a man trying to tame a bull is estimated to be 2500 years old by the Archaeologists.\nThere are references to people enjoying witnessing and participating in Jalikattu in Silappatikaram one of the 5 great epics of Tamil classical period and 2 other ancient literary works like Kalithogai and Malaipadukadaam.\nWhy PETA and other animal rights activists want to ban Jallikattu?\n\nBulls are deliberately placed in a terrifying situation in which they are forced to run away from a\u00a0mob of men. The bulls are so frightened that in desperation they jump off barriers which result in fatal injuries. The participants and spectators are also at risk.\nBulls are often provoked with alcohol, sticks, knives, sickles and even chilli powder in the eyes.\nBetting on the bulls is another problem.\nJudgments on Jallikattu\n\nIn 1991, the Environment Ministry had banned the training and exhibition of bears, monkeys, tigers, panthers and dogs. This was challenged by the Indian Circus organisation in the Delhi High Court but the court upheld the notification.\nThe ban on Jallikattu itself has existed on and off since 2006.\nIn 2006, the Madras High Court banned it after the death of a young spectator.\nIn 2009, the ban was subsequently lifted with the Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act, 2009.\nIn 2011, the Environment Ministry at the Center issued a notification especially mentioning \u2018bulls\u2019.\nBut even after the 2011 notice, the Jallikattu practice continued to be held because under the Tamil Nadu Regulation Act No. 27 of 2009.\nAfter it was found that the regulations were not being followed and that bulls were indeed being subjected to cruelty as defined under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) filed a petition.\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court banned Jallikattu and struck down the 2009 act.\nIn January 2016, in what could be seen as a clearly political move, the union environment ministry revoked the ban by issuing a notification months before the elections in Tamil Nadu were due to be held.\nIn January 2016, Supreme Court stayed this 2016 Union Government notification, as it was challenged by the AWBI and PETA. The case is still being heard and so far the Court has not delivered its final verdict.\nOn 8 January 2017, several hundreds of protesters conducted a rally at Chennai Marina opposing the ban on Jallikattu.\u00a0The participants walked from the lighthouse to the labour statue bearing posters saying \u2018save Jallikattu\u2019. Following the protests at Chennai, many students started rallies in various towns of Tamil Nadu. Numerous illegal Jallikattu events were held across Tamil Nadu in protest of the ban, and hundreds of participants were detained by police in response.\nDue to these protests, on 21 January 2017, the Governor of Tamil Nadu issued a new ordinance that authorized the continuation of jallikattu events.\u00a0The ordinance is a \u2018State amendment\u2019 to the Central Act \u2013 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1960). This means that in its application to Tamil Nadu, some provisions will be different from what they are for the rest of the country. PCA falls under Entry 17 (Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) in the Concurrent List of the Constitution. This means both the Centre and the States have concurrent power to enact laws on the subject.\nOn 23 January 2017, the Tamil Nadu legislature passed a bi-partisan bill, with the accent of Indian President, exempting jallikattu from the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1960). But\u00a0Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act of 2017 is not much different from the state law overturned by Supreme Court in 2009.\nSupporters arguments for continuing Jallikattu\n\nJallikattu is a way through which farmers flaunt their personal strength, the strength of their bulls, love for their cattle and how well they have looked after them and a chance to find out the most potent bull to mate their cows.\nFor a Tamilian, the bull is a member of the family and to establish their identity as a hardworking, self-sufficient and powerful Tamilian.\nThe supporters of jallikattu argue that on the basis of these rare issues the Supreme Court cannot ban 2500 years old tradition.\nIf the sport is banned, farmers will be forced to abandon the raising of native livestock (Bos indicus bull, such as the Pulikulam breed or\u00a0Kangayam breed) which already stands threatened due to the extensive use of motor pumps, tractors, and mechanized agriculture.\nWhat are the recent policies of India on Animal Advocacy?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe National Green Tribunal placed an interim ban on glass-coated kite flying strings after a petition by PETA because it causes the death of many birds. The ban came just before Makar Sankranti.\nIn December 2016, the Hyderabad High Court upheld the ban on cockfighting in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, after a petition was filed by the AWBI, HSI India (Humane Society International), PFA, and other organisations.\nIn 2016, an amendment to the Schedule Y of the Drugs and Cosmetic Rules, 1945, was passed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, following appeals by PETA India, HSI India (Humane Society International), and the Union Minister Maneka Gandhi.\u00a0The amendment prevents testing on animals for new drug including two cruel and obsolete drug tests on rabbits, including the Draize irritation test.\nIn 2016, HSI India and People for Animals urged the Director General of Foreign Trade to take cognisance of animal welfare concerns related to the shipping and import of dogs that are not suitable to India\u2019s tropical climate, including Siberian huskies, St Bernard\u2019s, and Alaskan malamutes.They are often left out by the owners because they do not have a proper understanding of the breed\u2019s requirements.\nThe Gujarat High court banned the caging of birds in Dadra and Nagar Haveli after an appeal was filed by PETA India, as it is the fundamental right of the bird to live freely in the open sky. If the birds are kept caged it will amount to illegal confinement.\nFollowing efforts by PETA India, new veterinary education regulations will eliminate the killings of calves. According to PETA, almost 1,000 calves are killed annually in India to teach veterinary anatomy and surgery to medical students, along with thousands of frogs, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. The regulations will include computer simulation, the setting up of an ethically-sourced body-donation programme and other humane teaching methods.\nConclusion\n\nThe legal situation surrounding jallikattu is as yet not clearly resolved. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act of 2017 is not much different from the state law overturned by Supreme Court in 2009. For the Supreme Court, the question of interim stay on Tamil Nadu\u2019s Jallikattu Amendment Act is still open.\n\nThe matter will only be truly resolved if the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (PCA) is amended by the Parliament. State ordinances and state laws cannot overrule an Indian federal law.\n\nAgain, if Jallikattu is a part of Tamil culture, it has to be conducted with protection to animals and human beings. It should be regulated by an authority. Age old traditions and cultures need to be revisited if they are in violation of the laws of the land.\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Haya Wakil"

The doctor-population ratio\u00a0is far lower than prescribed by World Health Organisation (one for every 1,674 persons, as per the parliamentary panel report, against the WHO-recommended one to 1,000).\n\nMedical Council of India (MCI)\n\nManagement of medical education in India should take the major responsibility of such a paradoxical trend. Medical Council of India (MCI) is the regulatory body for medical education and medical practices in India. Many blame MCI for problems in the India health sector.\u00a0The solution to this situation lies mainly in reforming and revamping MCI.\n\nHowever, Medical Council of India (MCI) has conducted many studies to identify the problems the medical field (Eg: Vision 2015 Report).\n\nVision 2015 report of MCI\n\nMCI published a vision document, in which it has analyzed problems of healthcare sector and reforms needed to resolve them.\n\n3 main reasons for India\u2019s healthcare woes:\nShortage of physicians\u00a0(both generalists and specialists).\nInequitable distribution of manpower and resources.\nDeficiencies in the quality of medical education.\nProposed reforms:\nIncrease production of doctors.\nReform curriculum by a transition from a science-based curriculum to skills and competency-based curriculum.\nThere is a need to emphasis on primary health care and family medicine.\nMedical institutions should be\u00a0strengthened by investing in technology.\n\nThe final goal of the vision document is to produce world-class Indian doctors. Needless to say, this vision remained a mere vision, even in 2018, without any marked improvement in ground reality.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Problems of Medical Education in India\n\nMedical education in India faces many issues, some of which are identified in the vision document. Most important of them are:\n\n1. Inter-state and intra-state\u00a0inequality in the distribution of manpower and resources\nThere is a huge disparity in availability of opportunities for students across states.\n2010 report by MHRD had stated that four states \u2013 Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu \u2013 account for 1.3 lakh out of 2.4 lakh medical seats across India.\nThere is also a glaring rural-urban disparity in both availabilities of health care and colleges.\nA blanket standard for starting a medical college leads to neglect of states like Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland etc. and rural areas.\nAmidst this situation, new medical colleges can bring in uniformity of access across sates and fill the demand-supply gap.\n2. Low doctor-population ratio\u00a0\nOne of the reasons for this low ratio is that only low number of medical graduates are passing out each year. Reasons include:\nAs MBBS students are unable to find jobs, they are forced to specialize in a particular field leading to a Super-Specialty craze.\nBrain drain to developed countries is also one of the reasons for unavailability of doctors in India.\nMCI regulations prevent experienced MBBS doctors from carrying out procedures like cesareans and ultrasound tests. Experienced nurses are barred from administering anaesthesia. This leads to failure of utilizing the experienced manpower to increase the service delivery.\nThis shortage of doctors is largely affected by rural health care.\u00a0\nAnother casualty of the Super-specialty craze is Research and teaching, as no one is choosing research or teaching as their preferred career.\n\nSingle breed of doctors can\u2019t cater to all the needs, especially in a country as diverse as India. So medical colleges should sensitize students about all the available opportunities and the attached perks and perils. This will introduce various options available to the students to explore and choose the field best applicable to them.\n\n3. Deficiencies in the quality of medical education\nThere is no uniformity in selection students to medical colleges. A common entrance test at all India level is required to ensure this uniformity.\nBreakthroughs are frequent in the medical field, but syllabus is not updated adequately reflecting these new trends in the medical field.\nLack of skilled teachers has afflicted all the educational paradigms of India. In the medical field, this issue is more critical. Here teachers are selected based on academic knowledge rather than clinical experience and adequate training is not imparted to them. Inadequate salary to teachers is also the main problem that makes this profession unattractive.\nNo uniform quality standards of graduating doctors across India. There should be an exit test, that will bring parity to standards graduating from all medical colleges across India.\n4. Lack of social accountability\nThe medical profession is unique as it requires an amount of social responsibility and societal empathy. Newly graduated doctors are unaware or indifferent to their social responsibility. Colleges play a major role in infusing the young students with an empathetic attitude towards society. But instead, they are encouraging rot learning without the consideration of humanitarian dimension. Hippocratic oath is largely morphing into hypocrisy.\n5. The recognition issue of foreign degrees\nMCI recognizes only a few medical courses from foreign universities. This becomes difficult for foreign graduated students to start practising in India.\n6. Unregulated private colleges\nChange in rules brought about after the reforms of the 1990s made it easier to open private colleges. This has increased the number of medical colleges but leads to many undesired consequences.\nThis commercialization of medical education had a profound impact on quality of graduate doctors, as anyone with money can buy seats in these colleges.\nMCI was incompetent to deal with this influx of commercialization and capitation fee skyrocketed, leading to\u00a0corruption\u00a0and black money circulation.\nThus sanctity of education was lost as medical education became a field for unscrupulous practice and profit gain than imparting education and providing quality doctors. This has resulted in an unhealthy competition which in-turn lead to unreasonable medical practices and unwarranted diagnostics as graduates from these institutions wanted to recover their capitation fees at the earliest. Eventually, this leads to complete crowding out of the societal and humanitarian dimension of medical education from colleges.\nMedical Council of India (MCI) \u2013 History | Objectives | Issues\n\nIndian education system is regulated by Medical Council of India. From setting standards of education to approving colleges and setting ethical guidelines for doctors, are vested in this single institution. So the working of the same will be the main determinant of the success of medical education in India. Given the maladies of the medical education system, an overhaul of MCI is the first and foremost step of rescuing the medical system from its current rot.\n\nHistory of MCI\nMCI is a statutory body for establishing uniform and high standards of medical education in India.\nIt was established in 1934 under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1933. It later reconstituted under the\u00a0Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.\nBut the controversy over corruption plagued the institution as it was dissolved by the President of India in 2010 following the arrest of MCI\u2019s president Ketan Desai under the Prevention of Corruption Act.\nIt was then reconstituted in 2013. After several committee reports and court orders, the government introduced National Medical Council bill in 2018.\nObjectives of MCI\nMaintenance of uniform standards of medical education, for both undergraduate and postgraduate courses.\nRecommendation for recognition/de-recognition of medical qualifications of medical institutions of India or foreign countries.\nPermanent registration/provisional registration of doctors with recognized medical qualifications.\nReciprocity with foreign countries in the matter of mutual recognition of medical qualifications.\nIssues of MCI\nSeparation of regulatory powers\nThe council regulates medical education as well as medical practice leading to the centralization of all regulatory functions in one single body.\nThere should be a separation between the regulation of medical education from regulation of medical practice. Expert committee- Ranjit Roy committee\u00a02014\u00a0\u2013recommended structural re-configuration of the council by separation of power.\nComposition of MCI\nMost of the members of the MCI are elected.\nNITI Aayog Committee (2016) noted that there will be a conflict of interest if members are elected. Because if the regulator is elected by the same fraternity that it would monitor, it will become ineffective and also prevents the entry of skilled professionals for the job. The Committee recommended the appointment of regulators through an independent selection process than elections.\nFee Regulation\nMCI is authorized for fee regulation of private colleges.\nNITI Aayog Committee (2016)\u00a0recommended against this practice as it will lead to corruption and increased capitation fees. Fee cap will discourage the entry of genuine private colleges, limiting the expansion of medical education in the country. Disallowing for-profit medical education has driven profit-taking underground with various kinds of inventive fee structures by medical colleges.\nProfessional conduct\nStanding Committee on Health (2016)\u00a0observed that the present focus of the MCI is only on licensing of medical colleges and no emphasis given to the enforcement of medical ethics in education and on instances of corruption noted within the MCI.\nCommittee recommended that the areas of medical education and medical practice should be separated in terms of enforcement of the appropriate ethics for each of these stages.\n\nThus, now MCI has evolved into a body that has become a powerful rationing authority, controlled by those who it is supposed to be regulating, that is powerful medical colleges and medical professionals.\n\nVarious Committees on Medical Education in India\n1. Ranjit Roy committee\u00a02014\n\nAmidst these crises, the government appointed a high power committee under the chairmanship of Ranjith Roy to look into the issue comprehensively and recommend reforms. Thus the committee has given recommendations, which form the basis of current restructuring of medical education in India. Important recommendations are:\n\nAn\u00a0umbrella body \u2013\u00a0National Medical Commission (NMC) should be constituted through a new act\nNational Medical Commission should have an Appellate Tribunal and four independent and autonomous boards viz.\nUnder-Graduate medical Education Board (UGMEB),\nPost-Graduate Medical Education Board (PGMED),\nMedical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB)\nEthics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB).\nSteps to be taken to decrease the cost of medical education in India.\nRegional\u00a0accessibility should be\u00a0increased.\nDoctor to patient ratio should be increased.\nCommon entrance exam should be conducted.\n\nA parliamentary committee to overhaul MCI was constituted to study Ranjith Roy committee report.\n\n2. Parliamentary standing committee to overhaul MCI 2016 \u2013\u00a0Prof Ram Gopal Yadav\n\nMajor observations of the committee are:\n\nThe committee called MCI a \u201cclub\u201d of influential medical practitioners who act without any fear of government and regulations.\nThere was widespread corruption in granting approval for setting up medical colleges and prevalence of \u2018random\u2019 and opaque inspections as a scrupulous method for corruption.\nThe committee finds MCI as responsible for the prevailing pathetic state of health care and low standard of conduct of medical practitioners and hospitals.\nIt opined that the composition of MCI neither represent professional excellence nor follows medical ethos. More than half of the members are either from corporate hospitals or in private practice, carrying out unnecessary diagnostic tests and surgical procedures and flouting government rules and regulations, especially about treating patients from underprivileged backgrounds.\n\nThe committee asked the government to implement Prof Ranjit Roy Chaudhury committee. The government has introduced NEET exam as a common entrance test from 2016. But on other recommendations, government dragged its feet. Supreme Court ordered an oversight committee under Justice Lodha. Thus the inefficiency of government or executive paved the way for judicial activism.\n\n3. Oversight committee under Justice Lodha 2016\n\nSupreme Court set up an oversight committee under Justice Lodha while\u00a0endorsing\u00a0Parliamentary standing committee report, through\u00a0Article 142,\u00a0to bring in transparency and accountability within the MCI and oversee its statutory functioning. But a turf war between the Supreme court established the oversight committee and MCI hindered reform measures Then the government-appointed a team of five eminent doctors to oversee the medical regulatory body as the 1-year mandate of oversight committee ended.\n\nNational Medical Council Bill 2018 \u2013 Concerns and Solutions\n\nThus we have seen that there are many maladies in medical education in India, most of which roots back to the inefficient functioning of the regulator, the MCI. After a parliamentary committee report and an oversight committee by the Supreme Court, finally, the government have introduced a new bill, titled National Medical Council 2018. It\u00a0is\u00a0currently being debated in parliament. As the bill is being debated, we will look into the issues that are needed to be addressed in the bill:\n\n#Issue 1 \u2013 Inequitable distribution of manpower and resources\nA fixed percentage of seats in each private colleges with government-determined fee structure will cater to economically underprivileged meritorious students. This can meet the issue of access to medical education by weaker sections.\nRemoving bottlenecks to starting colleges, such as conditions stipulating the possession of a vast extent of land and needlessly extensive infrastructure, will considerably rectify the imbalance, especially in under-served States. The primary criterion to set up a college should only be the availability of suitable facilities to impart quality medical education.\n#Issue 2 \u2013 Low doctor-population ratio\nEnding the fee cap and allowing private medical colleges to start new for-profit colleges.\nThis will meet the supply side constraints of medical practice in India by increasing number of doctors. It will also eliminate the regulatory-capture of the medical field in India.\nthis will also reduce corruption and black money generation simultaneously increasing the government revenue. Also, competition among private colleges will decrease the fees, making medical education accessible to all sections of society.\nBridge courses which allow alternative-medicine practitioners (AYUSH) to prescribe modern drugs. (in line with barefoot doctors in China) can broad-base pyramid of health sector by increasing doctors in primary and secondary sector.\nEmpowering experienced doctors and nurses for taking additional responsibilities will be a method for optimal utilization of experienced manpower to give health care services.\nthree-year diploma course for rural medical-care providers, in lines of the Licentiate Medical Practitioners(before 1946), to take up the additional responsibilities of the healthcare sector\nLeverage practitioners in AYUSH to meet doctor deficit through\u00a0cross-practising.\u00a0Shailaja Chandra report 2013\u00a0had opined that\u00a0National Rural Health Mission had recruited AYUSH physicians as the sole care provider in many states, which were effective in meeting the requirement of health care providers. The report recommended training those AYUSH physicians to meet demands in Primary Health Centres.\n#Issue 3 \u2013 Deficiencies in the quality of medical education\nNational licentiate examination for doctors to practice medicine can help to restore public confidence in the competence of medical practitioners by ensuring uniform quality standards across India. Entrance level non-uniformity is met with the introduction of NEET\nIndian healthcare system should incorporate the\u00a0Psycho Socio-Ecological (PSE) model of health.\u00a0PSE focuses on\u00a0social determinants of health with an emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention\nMedical education pedagogy should be improved by frequently revamping syllabus with respect to new breakthroughs in the medical field. The curriculum should include training on emerging technologies and models of healthcare delivery.\nIndia doesn\u2019t follow the use of OSCEs (objective structured clinical exams) to test medical candidates. Thus, their clinical skills are not tested till they start practising.\n#Issue 4 \u2013 Lack of social accountability\nNeed to align medical education with societal needs and expectations than work in isolation. For this community-based education is needed.\n#Issue 5 \u2013 Revamping MCI\nSeparation of power between medical education and medical practice should be the first step in reforming the MCI.\nThere should be an independent selection committee to select members in NMC than electing the members as is done previously with MCI.\nthe annual inspection should be scrapped with one-time registration and licensing, thus nullifying the scope of corruption through random inspections.\nThere should be an independent accreditation and rating agency to inspect and rate colleges on basic standards and a penalty for not conferring with set standards.\nTo reflect interests and concerns of states, an advisory body consisting of representatives from all states and UT should be constituted to advise NMC. Because each state have varied requirements and for a federal nation like India, a one-size-fits-all policy is not suitable. This will lead to issues, like that of Tamil Nadu during the implementation of NEET, to crop up.\nConclusion\n\nIndian higher education system has a common problem concerning with incapacity of regulators like UGC, AICTE, MCI etc. A common problem of these institutions is the concentration of power as they regulate both educational practices and professional practices\u00a0leading to a conflict of interest. There is a need for comprehensive reforms to usher in governance reforms for cleansing Indian higher education system of its maladies.\n\nMoreover, all stakeholders should acknowledge that medical education has a special sanctity in itself. This should not be lost to the altar of profit-making.\n\nAs from above discussion, it is clear that a complete surgery of Indian medical education system is needed in order to cure cancer with which it has been afflicted. NMC act will be a watershed act in this respect. For a bill of such huge scope, it is prudent to have wide-ranging debates and discussions. So delay in the passage of the act is worth the while for waiting.\n\nArticle by: Sethu\u00a0Krishnan M\n\nReferences: PRS blog, The Hindu, Wikipedia, Hindustan Times, New Indian Express, India Today"

It is found in many contemporary constitutions. Canada and the US also allow the right to recall on grounds of misfeasance and misconduct.\n\nShould we recall the representatives we elected?\n\nThere are numerous instances in India which could demonstrate the said proposition, for instance:\n\nSri Prakash Jaiswal has openly rejected the findings of the CAG report on the coal-gate scam.\nVilasrao Deshmukh has allegedly been involved in the infamous Adarsh Society scam.\nA. Raja had engaged in massive corruption during the allocation of 2G-spectrum etc.\n\nIt this backdrop, there has been a wide-spread demand to have a right to recall or a right to de-elect our elected representatives.\n\nThe progress of \u2018Right to Recall\u2019 in India\nIn 2016, Varun Gandhi introduced \u2018The Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill\u2018 in Lok Sabha to recall MPs, MLAs for the non-performance. However, the concept of Right to Recall was not a new one in India.\nThe concept of \u201cRajdharma\u201d during the Vedic times is similar to the concept of Right to Recall. In this system, the king was removed when there is a lack of effective governance.\nIn 1944, M.N. Roy proposed the decentralisation and devolution of governance which will allow for the election and recall of representatives.\nThe \u2018Right to recall\u2019 was stated by Somnath Chatterjee when he said that it can be used for accountability purposes.\nThe Representation of Peoples Act (RPA) 1951 talks about Right to Recall. RPA does not account the ground of incompetence or the dissatisfaction of the electorate as the ground for recall and vacation. It only provides for the vacation of the office upon the commission of the certain offence.\nRight to recall exists in the local bodies of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh.\nThe Judiciary\u2019s take on the Right to Recall\n\nIn the case of Mohan Lal Tripathi Vs. District Magistrate, Rae Bareilly and Ors., the Supreme Court of India opined that:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n\u201cA President who is elected by the entire electorate when removed by such members of the Board who have also been elected by the people is in fact removal by the electorate itself. The Board represents the entire electorate as they are representatives of the people although smaller in the body. Such provision neither violates the spirit nor purpose of recall of an elected representative.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Allahabad High Court later in the case of Smt. Ram Beti Vs. District Panchayat Raj Adhikari and Ors. advised that the provisions of removal of the representative could be made more stringent by restoring the old provisions of recall by Gram Sabha i.e. by the electors themselves.\n\nThe position taken by the Supreme Court appears to be quite dangerous and therefore, the advice was given by the Allahabad High Court indeed holds substance. Therefore, the interests of justice and fairness demand that the de facto power to remove the representatives should be with the electorate itself and not the representatives of the electorate.\n\nWhat are the advantages of Right to Recall?\nIt gives the power to ensure vertical accountability of a person in a democracy.\nCriminalization of politics would reduce.\nRaise inclusiveness and engender direct democracy.\nElection promises would be fulfilled by the representative due to the apprehension that he may be kicked out if he does not keep promises.\nThe free and fair election is the very essence of the democracy. The people should decide according to their confidence on the elected one who should be elected and who can be removed.\nTo deepen democracy, the right to recall must be given hand in hand with the right to vote.\nHaving the system of recall will deter candidates from spending crores of money in campaigning for the elections because they will always have a fear of being recalled.\nWhat are the disadvantages of Right to Recall?\nRight to recall creates an additional burden on the Election Commission.\nIt will also place undue pressure on limited resources such as manpower, time, money etc.\nThe criteria provided for recall viz., the dissatisfaction of the electorate with the performance of the candidate, is vague and provides immense scope for misuse.\nThe representative would be under constant pressure to work the way people want him.\nThere is an uncertainty of the time period he would be serving the public. This uncertainty would make it hard to make plans/policies which yield substantial results in long-term.\nPolitical rivals would make an issue out of smallest of the mistake of the representative and demand a recall election.\nRepresentatives would keep spending lots of money just to please people.\nThere will be a state constant political turmoil and politicians would be busy saving seat instead of working for development.\nIt is contentious as to whether the right to recall will instil vertical accountability. For instance, the existence of local self-government has not automatically led to the\u00a0improvement of vertical accountability across India.\nIn a polity, which is yet to have an efficient and impartial bureaucracy, it is contentious as to whether the right to recall has met expectations vis-\u00e0-vis the limited number of local self-government frameworks which provide such right to the electorate (as in the case of Madhya Pradesh).\nEven though the right to recall is intuitive, it must be rejected as it does not satisfy the test of pragmatism.\nPrimarily, it leads to \u2018excess\u2019 of democracy and this will hamper the independence of the legislators.\nWay forward\nGranting of Right to Reject is a balanced option. It is safer and would not lead to constant political upheaval. Parties would be forced to give a ticket to a candidate with clean and good past record. Good representatives can actually be expected to keep up their performance for next five years.\nLegislative change is required to bring about right to recall.\nBuilt-in safeguards should be there.\nHowever, the right to recall should not be misused to harass the elected representatives.\nThe electronic voting procedure should be used.\nIt should be ensured that the representatives cannot be recalled by a small margin of voters.\nIt should represent the mandate of the people.\nMoreover, any elected person when found to be engaged in the corrupt practice or any misdeed can be removed from his position.\n\nArticle by: Ipsita Mishra"

Let us discuss EVMs in detail and see whether they can be tampered with or not.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and how does it work?\nWhy did India replace paper ballots with Electronic Voting Machine?\nWhen were Electronic Voting Machines first used in elections?\nWhat is the latest controversy about Electronic Voting Machines?\nBefore Polling\nDuring polling\nAfter voting\nHow has the world treated Electronic Voting Machines?\nElection Commission\u2019s response to criticisms\nVoter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT)\nWhat are Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and how does it work?\nEVMs are electronic voting machines which provide the voter with a button for each choice and it is\nconnected by a cable to an electronic ballot box.\nIt consists of two units \u2013 control unit and balloting unit\u2013 which are connected by a 5-metre cable.\nThe control unit is with the Election Commission appointed polling officer and the Balloting Unit is in the voting compartment into which the voter enters to cast his/her vote in secret by pressing the button against the name and symbol of the candidate of his/her choice.\nThe EVM runs on a 6-volt single alkaline battery fitted in the control unit, and can even be used in areas that have no electricity.\nWhy did India replace paper ballots with Electronic Voting Machine?\nInherent problems of paper ballots \u2013 their printing, storage, and transportation involve huge\nexpenditure, lakhs of ballot boxes need for each election and logistics issues with their safe\nstorage between elections.\nUsing EVMs mean doing away with paper ballots, thus save paper and hence trees.\nIt makes the voting process very simple and easy.\nEVMs, in the long run, are cost effective.\nEVMs don\u2019t require electricity and run on batteries.\nEVMs are lighter and portable as compared to huge ballot boxes.\nEVMs have made the vote counting process much faster, delivering results in hours as against\nmanual counting of votes.\nWhen were Electronic Voting Machines first used in elections?\n\nEVMs were used on experimental basis for the first time in 16 Assembly Constituencies in the States of\nMadhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and NCT of Delhi in 1998. In the Lok Sabha elections of 2004, the entire\ncountry voted using EVMs.\n\nWhat is the latest controversy about Electronic Voting Machines?\nThe opposition parties have alleged that the EVMs have been tampered with in favour of the ruling party.\nThis allegation is not new and both political parties and experts have repeatedly questioned the\nfunctioning of EVMs since its adoption.\nFollowing are the ways the doubters allege EVMs can be tampered with:\nBefore Polling\nChips/components replaced with look-alikes that favour particular party.\nTo beat mock drills, manipulation programmed such that it kicks in only once when voting has\nbeen going on for a while. So mock poll shows correct results but final tally dodgy.\nA chip with a Bluetooth link placed in an EVM controlled from a mobile phone.\nDuring polling\nEVMs can be rigged to switch votes between the candidates.\nThe voter can\u2019t know whether the vote reported is same as vote the cast.\nIt is alleged that recorded vote may never be cast.\nThere is no reliable way to detect errors in the recording of votes.\nAfter voting\nPortable hardware devices can change vote records stored in the machines (can be carried out\nby local officials).\nPhysical seals on EVMs consists of stickers, string, and red wax is not difficult to tinker with.\n\nNote: Further Two PSUs Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) which manufacture EVMs engage others, including foreign firms, to make EVM chips which can be a potential hazard.\n\nNote: It is to be noted that hacking of EVMs is apparently not possible as these have no internet connection.\n\nHow has the world treated Electronic Voting Machines?\nGermany ended electronic voting in 2009 on grounds that system lacked transparency. The court ruled electronic voting as unconstitutional.\nNetherlands banned EVMs in 2007 after an anti-EVM group showed how the machines could be\nmanipulated within 5 minutes without anybody spotting the fraud.\nIn the US, states that use electronic voting make a paper trail mandatory.\nEngland and France have never used EVMs.\nItaly felt e-voting results could be fudged.\nIreland junked EVMs after spending 51 million pounds researching them for 3 years.\nElection Commission\u2019s response to criticisms\nIn 2009, ECI invited skeptics to demonstrate the alleged fallibility of EVMs, using 100 randomly\nsourced machines from 10 states. The outcome was that none of the persons who were given\nopportunity could demonstrate that ECI-EVM could\u00a0be tampered in any of the 100 machines put on\ndisplay.\nECI said that EVMs can neither be reprogrammed nor controlled by the external device. The source\ncode is so designed that it allows the voter to cast the vote only once. The next vote can be\nrecorded only after the Presiding Officer enables the ballot on the Control Unit. In between, the\nmachine becomes dead to any signal from outside.\nThe Commission said that the comparison between EVMs in India and abroad, where they have\nfailed, are both misplaced and misguided. This is because most of the systems used in other\ncountries are PC based and running on the operating system. Hence they are vulnerable to hacking.\nBut EVMs in India are the standalone machine without being part of any input. The software in the\nchip is one time programmable and is burnt into the chip at the time of manufacture. Nothing\ncan be written on the chip after manufacture. Thus there is a fundamental difference between\nEVMs in India and abroad.\nVoter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT)\n\nFollowing a PIL by Subramanian Swamy, Supreme Court asked EC to introduce VVPAT.\nVVPAT is a slip generated in a printer-like a machine attached to EVM and flashes voter\u2019s choice of candidate and party. Generated slip is shown for a few seconds to the voter to cross check before it falls into a sealed drop box which can be opened during counting. Under VVPATs, initially, election results are announced based on the recording of votes given by EVMs. If the election results are disputed, then the votes recorded under Paper Trail System shall be counted and announced. If there is any discrepancy between the two results, then the result given by VVPAT will prevail over the EVMs.\nThe Supreme Court has supported the EC endeavor to use VVPATs in a phased manner to usher in more transparency in voting.\nThe Election Commission would need over 16 lakh paper trail machines, which dispel doubts about votes cast using EVMs, to cover all polling stations in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.\nSince June 2014, the Commission has given at least 11 reminders to the government seeking funds for VVPAT machines.\nECIL and BEL, two PSUs which manufacture VVPATs and EVMs, need 30 months to manufacture the required number of VVPAT units from the day funds are released.\nThere are challenges and concerns with VVPAT too.\n\nArticle by: Rahul Sharma, UPSC Topper 2016, With All India Rank 76"

From time to time, this fault line becomes active, leading to the polarisation of North-South India.\n\nThe Polarization of North-South India: What we will analyse in this article?\n\nPoliticisation of this fault line has lead to many consequences for India as a nation. Political parties of both North and South India have made this imaginary separation a plank for their political entrepreneurship.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThis North-South divide is characterized by various fault lines like geography, economy, politics etc. Spatially and temporally, these fault lines had been activated at various times.\n\nCurrently, there is a resurgence of Dravida Nadu concept in South India. We will analyze the reason behind it. Fifteenth Finance Commission(FC) has been constituted by the Central government. But there is a lot of brouhaha regarding the Terms of Reference of this FC. We will examine the issue and how it relates to the question of the North-South divide.\n\nFinally, we will see the implications of the North-South divide and consequences caused by the frequent politicization of the issue. We then conclude by emphasizing the need for unity of North and South, and more importantly for India and steps to be taken to ensure this unity.\n\nHistory of the N-S divide: The Dravida Nadu Concept\n\nDravida Nadu is the name of a hypothetical \u201csovereign state\u201d demanded by Justice Party led by E. V. Ramasamy and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) led by C. N. Annadurai for the speakers of the Dravidian languages in South Asia.\n\nThe concept of Dravida Nadu had its root in the anti-Brahminism movement in Tamil Nadu which demanded social equality, greater power and control in government administration. Later it had taken the hue of a separatist movement, demanding a sovereign Tamil state.\nDravida Nadu as a political idea was first floated by Periyar E.V. Ramasamy. In 1925, he launched the Self-respect movement, and by 1930s he was formulating the most radical \u201canti-Aryanism\u201d.The rapport between the Justice Party and the Self-Respect movement of E.V.Ramasamy (who joined the party in 1935) strengthened the anti-Brahmin and anti-North sentiment.\u00a0He came out with the slogan \u201cTamil Nadu for Tamils\u201d in 1938 in response to the plan to introduce compulsory learning of Hindi across India.\nThe demand, which was limited to Tamil Nadu in initial times, was expanded to include other Dravidian speaking states viz. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana. \u201cSouth India\u201d, \u201cDeccan Federation\u201d and \u201cDakshinapath\u201d were other names used for Dravida Nadu. Movement of Dravida Nadu was at its peak in 1940s-60s.\n\nPost Independence, the demand for such a pan Dravidian state declined due to various reasons:\n\nDue to the fear of Tamil dominance, the demand was not taken up by other southern states.\nState Reorganisation Act 1956, which created states based on linguistic criteria, eased off the demand for separatism. Also, the government of India declared secessionism as an illegal act.\nBoth DMK and Justice party began to reorient their demand for Dravida Nadu to cater to their own local population than giving it a pan south Indian character.\n\nThough the demand for Dravida Nadu was faded away post-independence, the North-South fault line was not erased into oblivion. Even though it remained dormant, many issues were cropped up during the Post-Independent era which made these fault lines bleed. Also, from time to time, political parties rekindle various fractures along these fault lines to cater to their short-term political ambitions.\n\nFault lines\u00a0along the North India-South India Divide\n\nThe North-South divide is characterized by various fault lines like geography, economy, politics etc.\n\n1. Geographical\n\nNorth India has had very different historical experience than south India.\u00a0Many of the invasions coming through passes of Hindukush have constructed and re-constructed the historical experience of North.\n\nWhile South India was relatively immune from such invasions, the proximity of sea and trade through them had given South a distinct culture vis-a-vis North, which was influenced largely by trade through land routes, manifested in Silk Road.\n\n2. Constitutional\n\nConstitutional dimension of the North-South divide is largely subsumed in the larger issue of Centre-State relations and issues relating to federalism in India. These two fault lines, North-South divide and centralization of power in union government, have intertwined to make the matters more complex. Some of the provisions of the constitution that have created controversies on this front are:\n\nPresident\u2019s rule\nSince south Indian states are historically dominated by regional parties which were different from national parties occupying at centre and North Indian states, President\u2019s rule had been used arbitrarily against South Indian states. Eg: The First communist government in Kerala was removed through President\u2019s rule in 1959.\nSchedule 7\nStates have a huge responsibility with meagre financial resources. This has affected all the states irrespective of the North-South divide.\nArticle 351: It shall be the duty of the Union\u00a0to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule.\nThis article has created a rift between North and South, repercussions of which are still being felt across India. More on this is elaborated in the section on the cultural fault line.\n\nState\u2019s\u00a0claim for autonomy is persistently increasing as the political-economic axis of development is shifting towards regional level. After successfully \u2018holding together\u2019 for 75 years due to the flexibility of constitutional provisions, a question raises for the need to re-balance distribution of power between centre and states based on evolving socio-political and economic climate. This claim is shared by both North and South, but more vigorously by Southern states.\n\n3. Political\n\nPolitical leaders from South are not given adequate representation in political milieu of centre vis-a-vis political leaders from North. This creates a dichotomy as the economic centre of gravity is shifting towards the south at the same time the political centre of gravity is shifting north.\n\nWhile South is contributing economically to the nation, they don\u2019t occupy centre stage politically and are marginalized culturally. If these issues are not confronted, the fault lines of Indian federalism could deepen.\n\n4. Social\nIndia is slowly cleaving into two countries \u2013 a richer, older South and a poorer, younger North. According to Census 2011, southern states are showing a faster decline in the population growth rate as compared to the northern states. As a result of this, there is a scarcity of unskilled labour in the south which is currently filled in by migration from other parts of the country. This was also pointed out by Economic Survey 2015-16. Changing demographic patterns and migration of unskilled labourers from North to South has the potential to generate a cultural conflict in the country. For peninsular states, demographic dividend will peak in 2020. Whereas in Northern states it will peak in 2040.\nUrban section of the population with rapid demographic change resulting in higher female labour force participation would follow lifestyles different from other sections. This may lead to conflict between North and South. Increasing violence against migrants like that of Maharashtra by Shiv Sena is an example.\n5. Economical\nEconomic Survey 2015-16 have pointed out that:\u00a0spatial dispersion in income is still rising in India in the last decade (2004-14) despite more porous borders within India than between countries internationally \u2013 the forces of \u201cconvergence\u201d have been elusive. This spatial dispersion in income is mainly occurring along North-South divide or more broadly, along peninsular and hinterland India.\nBeyond the more familiar Bharat/India divide, it is the north/south divide that may prove consequential. Post-1990 reforms, there was an increase in inter-state inequality. This was mainly along the axis of the North-South divide. Thus states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh made use of the opportunities provided by reforms to develop, states like Bihar, UP, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh left behind.\nThis fault line has been recently energized on account of Terms of Reference of 15th FC. This will be discussed more elaborately in the end.\n6. Cultural\n\nLanguage \u2013 It was and is the main axis of the divide that is charged with a great emotional appeal. There was a lot of agitation and violence around the issue of national language during post-independence times like anti-Hindi agitation in Tamil Nadu 1960s.\n\nThe question on national language surfaced during constitutional assembly debates. Then a compromise based on\u00a0Munshi\u2013Ayyangar formula\u00a0was adopted in which\u00a0constitution did not specify any \u201cNational language\u201d and only mentioned \u201cOfficial languages\u201d of the Union as\u00a0Hindi in Devanagari script.\n\nBut there were many provisions related to official language in the constitution, in Part XVII that left open the fissures for future confrontation. Such provisions include:\n\nFor fifteen years, English would also be used as the official language\u00a0for all official purposes.\u00a0(Article 343).\nA language commission could be convened after five years to recommend ways to promote Hindi as the sole official language and to phase out the use of English (Article 344).\nOfficial communication between states and between states and the Union would be in the official language of the union (Article 345).\nEnglish would be used for all legal purposes \u2013 in court proceedings, bills, laws, rules and other regulations (Article 348).\nThe Union was duty bound to promote the spread and usage of Hindi (Article 351)\nThe 8th schedule included in the constitution to recognize various languages.\n\nParliamentary standing committee on first language commission report in\u00a01957\u00a0opined that\u00a0Hindi should be made the primary official language with English as the subsidiary one.\u00a0Rajaji convened an All India Language Conference to oppose the switch to Hindi and declared \u201cHindi is as much foreign to non-Hindi speaking people as English is to the protagonists of Hindi\u201d. Amidst this,\u00a0Nehru\u2019s assured that English will remain as additional Official Language till non-Hindi speakers decide otherwise.\n\nAll over India, there was a vigorous promotion of Hindi as the deadline of Art343 came closer. Tamil Nadu started Anti Hindi agitation. There was counter agitation by angry pro-Hindi activists in North India. Members of Jan Sangh went about the streets of New Delhi, blackening out English signs with tar.\n\nOfficial Language Act passed in 1963. The act provides for the continued use of English (even after 1965), in addition to Hindi, for all official purposes of the Union and also for the transaction of business in Parliament. Notably, this act enables the use of English indefinitely (without any time-limit). Further, this act was amended in 1967 to make the use of English, in addition to Hindi, compulsory in certain cases.\n\nThus the violence was temporarily controlled through\u00a0Official Language Act and amendment act which guaranteed the \u201cvirtual indefinite policy of bilingualism\u201d (English and Hindi) in official transactions.\n\nBut Article 351 re-energizes the issue periodically when centre tries to promote Hindi and South Indian states opposes such imposition. Eg: the opposition to Hindi signboard in Namma Metro stations in Bengaluru.\n\n7. Regionalism\nThe growing regionalism has created 28 states in India, double the number that India had in 1956 when the States Reorganisation Act was passed in Parliament.\nRegionalism and threat of successionism have affected many parts of the country: Punjab-Khalistan movement, Nagaland-Nagalim \u2013 there are so many examples.\nThe regional aspirations of South were the most strongly articulated among all other regional claims. But after the State Reorganisation, the claim for secessionism declined. Nevertheless, regional aspirations are still strong in southern states than northern states: demand of separate state flag by Karnataka.\nThe assertion of cultural and linguistic hegemony by the north, like the promotion of Hindi in an aggressive way, has also resulted in the heightened regional aspirations in South.\n\nThus below the Vindhyas, the mood is sullen. The South thinks the North is guilty of not only arrogance and ignorance but also cultural, economic and political colonialism. There is an increasing alienation between North and South in political discourse. Thus politically-articulated cultural rift between the North and South is growing.\n\nPratap Bhanu Mehta opines that there is a risk of a magnifying N-S divide in the current situation, as there is a national political formation that is inadequate to manage cultural difference, simultaneously party structures in states are becoming\u00a0fragile.\n\nThe rise of Hindutva in North India is creating a political dominance in the centre which is generating counter pressures from South. But politics in the south is also stagnant with entrenched caste politics, internal divisions etc. In this situation, South will try political mobilization based on North v/s South axis to carry forward their political agenda.\n\nAs levers of political power are skewing towards the demographic might of north India, South is fearful of economic and cultural hegemony by North. The manifestation of this tug of war is seen in the\u00a0resurgence of demand for Dravida Nadu.\n\n15th Finance Commission\n\nRecently union government\u00a0constituted 15th Finance Commission, headed by N.K.Singh, which will make recommendations for the five years commencing 1 April 2020 till 31 March 2025.\n\nSome of the terms of reference of the commission:\nThe Commission shall use the population data of 2011 while making its recommendations.\nRecommending a fiscal consolidation roadmap by factoring inappropriate levels of general and consolidated government debt and deficit levels.\nMeasurable performance-based incentives for states based on their effort in areas including expansion and deepening of tax net under GST and ease of doing business.\nFC is required to review the devolution formula and ascertain its impact on the fiscal capability of the Union government. (14 FC recommended devolution of 42% of taxes to states)\nThe discontent of Southern states\n\nTill now population data of 1971 census had been used in devolving taxes. Though 14 FC used population data of 2011 census along with 1971 census, the weight assigned to the same was lower. Reason for using 1971 census rather than 2011 census is to make sure States that have worked on population control do not lose out on benefits. As mentioned earlier, Southern states have a\u00a0declining trend of population, so they will be at a disadvantage if 2011 census is used for devolving taxes. Southern state sees this as though they are subsidizing the growth of the north. They consider this Term of Reference as penalizing states done well on family planning.\n\nCenter asks 15th FC to use 2011 census data instead of 1971 census used so far to determine devolution of taxes. This will further affect the interests of the south:we need to resist. @CMOKerala @CMOTamilNadu @ncbn @TelanganaCMO @Dev_Fadnavis @CMPuducherry https://t.co/6EoDp0xClh\n\n\u2014 Siddaramaiah (@siddaramaiah) 23 March 2018\n\nThere are other discontents shared by States in common, irrespective of the North-South divide, but vociferously being put forward by Southern states. Some of them are:\n\nFinance Commission should consider the effect of double policy blow of the\u00a0demonetisation and GST on state finances while considering devolution to states.\nThe Centre is stretching constitutional mandate of Finance Commission. FC has no role in deciding the path of fiscal management or imposing policies that are perceived as good for the state. The centre is using FC to impose their political-economic agenda.\nIn terms of reference, there is an exclusive privilege for \u2018committed expenditure\u2019 of centre.\n15 FC is also mandated to recommend performance based devolution\u00a0beyond fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to Local Self Government. This is an effort of the centre to micro-manage fiscal domain of states by meddling in the day-to-day governance of states. FC doesn\u2019t have the capacity to decide what will be a \u2018populist\u2019 measure for different states.\n\nRedistributive role of centre can\u2019t be discounted so resources should be efficiently transferred from developed to developing regions for more balanced development. Also, the population is not the only criteria for determining devolution by FC. Good governance and other developmental matrix are also considered by FC. So no state will be at a disadvantage. However, it is to be ensured that the redistributed resources are properly utilized by all states. Also, a state\u2019s voice should be incorporated while deciding the\u00a0Terms of Reference to avoid unnecessary controversies.\n\nThe Resurgence of the concept of Dravida Nadu\n\nIn 2017, when the Indian Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change issued a notification banning the sale of cattle for slaughter, Twitter users from the Kerala state (where beef dishes are popular) protested by trending the hashtag #DravidaNadu.\n\nThe hashtag also received support from Twitter users in Tamil Nadu.\n\nIn early 2018, Telugu Desam Party MP Murali Mohan expressed his dissatisfaction over the Union Government\u2019s supposed neglect towards South Indian states and warned that South India would form a separate country if the issue persisted. Further, when several heads of South Indian states expressed dismay over the Union Government\u2019s arrangements of tax revenue distribution to various states, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader M. K. Stalin expressed his support for a sovereign Dravida Nadu state, should all the other South Indian states ever share the same notion.\n\nSouth\u2019s opposition to Terms of Reference of 15 FC should be seen in this backdrop.\n\nCritical analysis of the Resurgent Aspiration of Dravida Nadu\n\nPlease understand, Your Excellency that India is two countries: an India of Light, and an India of Darkness. The ocean brings light to my country. Every place on the map of India near the ocean is well-off. But the river brings darkness to India.\n\n-\u201cThe White Tiger\u201d by Aravind Adiga\n\nEconomic Survey 2015-16 (ES) had mentioned Redistributive Resource Transfers (RRT) \u2013\u00a0gross devolution to the state adjusted for its share in aggregate GDP.\nAs Southern states are economically more developed than Northern states, RRT for Southern states will be relatively lower than Northern states.\nBut the distributive role of the centre\u00a0is of utmost importance for nation-building. So it is natural that resources from developed states are shifted to less developed ones for holistic development. Haphazard development neither suits North nor South. Furthermore, it cannot be assumed that the development of South is the result of efforts of the South alone. Policies like Freight Equalisation Policy had negatively impacted resource-rich states like Bihar, Chattisgarh etc. at the expense of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh etc.\nBut the bigger problem is that there is no\u00a0evidence of a positive relationship between RRT\u00a0from the centre to states and various state outcomes, including per capita consumption, GDP growth, development of manufacturing, own tax revenue effort, and institutional quality.\u00a0There is even suggestive evidence of a negative relationship. This situation can be perceived by the\u00a0South, as they are subsidizing the growth of the North.\nThe suggestion given by ES is to tie RRT\u00a0more strictly to fiscal and governance efforts on the part of the states\u00a0as provided for by the Thirteenth Finance Commission.\nES also points out that, despite rapid overall growth, there is striking evidence of\u00a0divergence or widening gaps\u00a0in income and consumption across the Indian states.\u00a0This raises the possibility that governance traps are impeding equalization within India. So North should try to improve their governance rather than depending on RRT through FC. Sign of progress is visible, as shown in the case of development of Rajasthan.\nSouthern states and the more prosperous northern states depend upon migrant labour as well as on resources and commodities that come from the less-developed parts of the country\u2014mainly the large northern and central states. Moreover, as the demography of South is declining, southern states will require young labour force from north to carry forward their development agenda and also for looking after the senior citizens. So South needs North as much as North needs South. And as poorer Northern states have demographic dividend ahead, it can decrease the disparity between states. So in place of needless squabbles, the need of the hour is to make suitable policies that will cater for smooth internal migration like the portability of social securities across states. This will necessitate cooperation between North and South.\nQuestion on delimitation is the big white elephant that nobody is trying to acknowledge. Before the 42nd Constitutional Amendment of 1976, the calculations behind the number of Lok Sabha seats was based on \u201cpopulation as ascertained at the last preceding Census of which the relevant figures have been published.\u201d But the 1971 Census figures showed a dramatic increase in population, after which the concept of family planning was introduced at the policy level. This meant that States that complied with the policy would lose out on all the areas where the population was taken into account. Hence, the 42nd Amendment picked the 1971 Census as the base for all calculations and froze it till the 2001 Census. The 84th Amendment further extended that to the first Census after 2026, which will be the Census of 2031. Even if the total number of Lok Sabha seats are increased after 2031 census, South is going to lose out on its presence in parliament. A multi-stakeholder discussion is needed to face the situation and devise a solution before 2031.\nThe concept of Dravida Nadu can\u2019t stand on its own as inter fight between southern states are common, like the Cauvery issue between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. So Dravida Nadu is nothing more than a plank to oppose the North and centre, to take political mileage out of the issue, than a meaningful grouping of Southern states.\nNorth should be sensitive to the aspirations of South and should not create a cultural hegemony through the unintended promotion of Hindi in non-Hindi states, especially South. The cultural domination, if ever occurs, should be a result of an automatic process rather than government action. Amendment of XVII part should be done, if needed, taking into account of the\u00a0aspirations of all stakeholders.\nGeneral mistrust between centre-state is also an issue in the recent escalation of discontent among southern states. Cooperative federalism as envisaged in GST council should be the way forward than over-centralization of Indian federalism.\nPolitical leaders should not only be fixated on short-term gains. Political leaders of Southern states should make development as a plank for contesting elections than imaginary North-South divide, like addressing the\u00a0growing trend of intra-state inequality in Southern states.\n\nThus the unity of India depends on mutual trust and cooperation of all states, facilitated by the centre. Labour, resources, capital, geography, all the determinants of development is available within the borders of Indian territory. We need to leverage these through cooperative federalism, rather than mobilizing around divisive and arbitrary fault lines, through proper policy actions.\n\nReferences: The Hindu, Indian Express, Hindustan Times, Wikipedia, Livemint, The Wire, Scroll\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Sethu Krishnan M"

It is a general term used to describe situations of exploitative nature in which the person cannot refuse or leave due to threats, violence, deception, and abuse of power.\nModern slavery includes exploitative acts such as forced labour and debt bondage, forced marriage, and human trafficking.\nForced labour and Debt bondage in India\nBonded labour is defined in the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act of 1976 as a system of forced or partly forced labour in which a debtor gets an advance of cash or kind in return for his labour or service to the creditor.\nForced labour and debt bondage are common practice across all the economic sectors in India.\nIt is mainly found\u00a0in certain industries such as brick kilns, carpet weaving, textile and garment manufacturing, embroidery, manual scavenging and agriculture.\nWho is affected by debt bondage?\nThe most affected people of debt bondage are the members of marginalised castes, tribes, religious minorities, refugees and migrant workers.\nThere are also instances of Nepali and Bangladeshi migrants being subjected to forced labour in India through debt bondage and recruitment fraud.\nWhat are the causes of forced labour in India?\nThe social and economic marginalisation of weaker sections and their inability to move out of their respective group makes them particularly vulnerable to forced labour and human trafficking.\nAbout 94% of the workforce in India are employed under informal and unregulated sectors. And the debt bondage continues to be prevalent in these sectors. Moreover, the lack of labour regulations in these sectors creates huge power imbalances in employer-worker relationships and increases workers\u2019 vulnerability to exploitation. Note- Labour legislation only available for formal sectors.\nChronic underpayment of minimum wages in low-skilled and semi-skilled work is also a major reason for debt bondage because due to the non-payment, the large-scale workforce has to depend on debt bondage to meet basic consumption needs, medical needs, social ritual needs etc.\nMost often, the members of the vulnerable groups lack good livelihood opportunities and access to credit and financial services, which makes them vulnerable to constant indebtedness.\nFailure of authorities to effectively implement measures to address the issue is also a reason for the prevalence of forced labour in India.\nWhat are the impacts of forced labour?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe labourers under forced labour and debt bondage are most often experience a wide range of exploitations such as contract substitution, holding back of the documents, non-payment or delayed payment of wages, exhausting working hours, deception and coercion.\nIn extreme cases, this exploitation becomes human trafficking for labour exploitation or slavery.\nFurthermore, higher degrees of poverty and illiteracy remain among these communities than the general population due to the forced labour practice.\nWhat are the measures taken by the government against forced labour?\nBonded labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 was enacted by the government in order to provide a legal framework against the practice of bonded labour in India. The Act is strengthened by labour legislation such as the Contract Labour Act of 1970, the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act, and the Minimum Wages Act. The Act abolished debt bondage and explicitly stated that all traditions, customs, contracts, and agreements which requires a person to provide bonded labour are null and do not have any legal or binding force. It also abolished bonded labour and provides for corporate and criminal liability which prescribes up to three years of imprisonment and a 2000 rupees fine for the acts of bonded labour. The act also provides for the establishment of vigilance committees across the country in order to identify and help the bonded labourers.\nThe Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 prohibits the engagement of children in all occupations and to prohibit the engagement of adolescents in hazardous occupations and processes. (Refer:\u00a0Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment\u00a0Act, 2016)\nJuvenile Justice Act of 2010 outlaws exploitation of juvenile or child workers such as procurement of juvenile for hazardous employments, keeping them in debt bondage, or withholding their wages.\nLabour laws \u2013 There are over 40 central legislation which is classified by industry or type of work and cover a wide range of work in factories, plantations and construction work. These legislations deals with issues such as minimum wage, maximum working hours, health, safety and working conditions.\nHow is the implementation?\nWith 90% of workers in the informal sectors in the country, the labour legislation is ineffective since it covers only formal sectors.\nDespite the abolition, debt bondage is still prevalent in India mainly because of the low prosecution rate for these crimes and in the case of a conviction, the penalties of imprisonment are imposed very rarely.\nAccording to Anti-slavery international, large numbers of Vigilance Committees have been established across India with an aim to identify and help bonded labourers. However, in reality, these committees are generally inactive and ineffective in its functioning.\nWhat is the way forward?\nInstead of just focussing on capturing and prosecuting the criminals, the government should also focus on addressing the root causes such as huge informal sector, marginalisation of communities, lack of financial and credit services, lack of livelihood opportunities etc.\nHuman trafficking in India\n\n[click_to_tweet tweet=\u201dAccording to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, South Asia with India at its centre, is the fastest growing and second-largest region for human trafficking in the world, after East Asia.\u201d quote=\u201dAccording to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, South Asia with India at its centre, is the fastest growing and second-largest region for human trafficking in the world, after East Asia.\u201d]\n\nAbout 90% of trafficking in India is internal and the most vulnerable are lower caste people, tribal people, religious minorities and women and girls from excluded groups.\n\nWhat are the causes of human trafficking in India?\nThe rise in mobility and growth of industries employing forced labourers are important factors for human trafficking.\nLack of regulations for work placement agencies which attracts adults and children for sex trafficking and forced labour including domestic servitude under false promises of providing work.\nTerrorist groups such as Naxalites are trafficking children as young as six for the purpose of spying, couriers, planting improvised explosive devices and fighting against the government.\nVarious groups are working across the country who traffick children and force them to beg.\nWhat are the impacts of human trafficking on victims?\nHuman trafficking results in mental disorders including depression and anxiety for the victims.\nTrafficked women are forced into prostitution and slavery, which adversely impacts their fundamental rights.\nWomen who are forced into trafficking also affected by diseases such as HIV, Tuberculosis and other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs).\nChildren as young as six are removed from their families and their basic rights such as the right to life and education have been deprived.\nWhat are the measures taken by the government against human trafficking?\nThe Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act, 1986 penalises trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation. The penalties under the act ranging from 7 years to life imprisonment.\nThe Trafficking of Persons (prevention, protection and rehabilitation) bill, 2018 aims at addressing the issue of trafficking with objectives of prevention, rescue and rehabilitation. It covers various forms of trafficking which includes trafficking for the purpose of forced labour, begging, marriage etc. It also provides for punishment, confidentiality of victims, rehabilitation of victims and institutional mechanism for effective enforcement of the law.\nHow is the implementation?\nThere were several cases of inaction by police and prosecutors which signifies poor enforcement of the anti-trafficking legal framework, corruption and absence of awareness or capacity in several parts of the country.\nVictims often face issues such as difficulty in accessing justice including their inability to travel to court, social stigma and intimidation, and considerable delays in trials.\nWhat is the way forward?\nThe government should stop the penalisation of trafficking victims such as restrictions on their travel and increase effective prosecutions and convictions for all forms of trafficking.\nThe government should also increase prosecutions and convictions of officials who are complicit in the enforcement of laws against trafficking.\nForced Marriage in India\n\nEven though India is fast developing and moving towards a better tomorrow, forced marriage still affects many Indian families and society at large. When a girl crosses the age of 18, she is emotionally convinced and is forced into marriage. Evidence proves that forced marriage often results in slave-like conditions for women in Indian families.\n\nWhat does forced marriage mean?\nForced marriage happens when one or both spouses do not agree to the marriage. Children and adults with mental disabilities cannot consent to marriage. Girls below the age of 18 and boys below the age of 21 cannot legally marry in India.\nForced marriage is different from arranged marriage in the sense that unlike latter, forced marriage doesn\u2019t need the consent of the persons who are going to marry and often involves threat, coercion, violence, pressure etc. In extreme cases, parents drugs and kidnaps their own child to make the marriage happen.\nWhat are the reasons behind forced marriage?\nPersons who are having a developmental or mental disability are most often forced to marry since they cannot give their consent.\nForced marriage occurs often in the name of protecting family honour.\nThe need to retain ancestral land, property, and wealth in the family is also a factor for the forced marriage.\nParents often react to social pressures such as neighbours and older relatives to force their children into marriage.\nHigh poverty and debt levels also drive the parents to coerce their children into marriage in return for dowry.\nWhat are the impacts of forced marriage on victims?\nVictims often endure violence in the forced marriage which threatens them and breaks them to make sure that they can\u2019t withdraw from the marriage. The violence may include rape. When the rape results in the birth of a child, mothers often find it difficult to leave the marriage. Their right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the constitution taken from them.\nWhat are the initiatives taken by the government?\nThere is a number of laws related to forced marriage which includes the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, the Family Courts Act, 1984 and the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA) and Prohibition of child marriage act, 2006.\nPWDVA recognises the forced marriage as a form of domestic violence so as to prevent child marriages or forced marriages of daughters.\nThe Delhi High Court declared that the right to choose one\u2019s life partner is a fundamental right and an integral part of the right to life. Therefore, the right to life includes the right to consensual marriage in India. Hence forced marriage is a violation of the fundamental right and the victims can move the Supreme Court directly to get justice.\nWhat is the way forward?\nSecuring access to quality education for girls at primary and secondary level can prevent forced and early marriages since education will enable them to take decisions on their own and also gives them exposure to various initiatives of the government against forced marriages.\nDespite Right to Education implementation, girls still face multiple barriers in accessing education such as fees, geographic barriers, sexual harassment at school, lack of safe and sanitary toilet facilities, lack of adequate teachers and corporal punishment.\nConclusion\n\nThe country will not be able to achieve its sustainable development goals if the majority of its population are under modern slavery or slave-like conditions. In the words of Sheryl WuDunn, \u201cThe tools to crush modern slavery exist, but the political will is lacking\u201d.\n\nTherefore, it is high time that the government take proper actions against the forced labour, forced marriage and human trafficking in order to make the country a better place to live.\n\nRead:\u00a0Forced Labour\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Santhosh Kumar D"

This includes components like police and courts.\nThe aim of the Criminal Justice System (CJS) is to\u00a0protect the rights and personal liberty of individuals and the society against its invasion by others.\nThe Criminal law in India is contained in a number of sources \u2013 The Indian Penal Code of 1860, the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.\nCJS can impose penalties on those who violate the established laws.\nThe criminal law and criminal procedure are in the concurrent list of the seventh schedule of the constitution.\nBackground of the Criminal Justice System in India\nThe Criminal Justice System in India is an age-old system primarily based upon the Penal legal system that was established by the British Rule in India.\nThe system has still not undergone any substantial changes even after 70 years of Independence. The biggest example could be Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that defines sedition and provides for its punishment.\nThe entire Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) was amended in 1973.\nThe appointment of the Vohra Committee was the very first attempt towards reforming the Criminal Justice System in India. Vohra Committee report (1993) made an observation on the criminalisation of\u00a0politics\u00a0and of the nexus among criminals,\u00a0politicians\u00a0and\u00a0bureaucrats\u00a0in India.\nIn 2000,\u00a0the government formed a panel headed by Justice V.S. Malimath, the former Chief Justice of Kerala and Karnataka, to suggest reform in the century-old criminal justice system.\nThe Malimath Committee submitted its report in 2003 with 158 recommendations but these were never implemented.\nThe Committee felt that the existing system \u201cweighed in favour of the accused and did not adequately focus on justice to the victims of crime.\u201d\nWhy there is a need for reform in the\u00a0Criminal Justice System in India?\n\n[click_to_tweet tweet=\u201dIn India only about 16 percent of people booked for criminal offences are finally convicted.

Low rate of conviction points to the inefficiency of the Criminal Justice System of India \u2013 which includes the police, prosecutors, and the judiciary.\u201d]\n\nThe system has become ineffective: The state has constituted the CJS to protect the rights of the innocent and punish the guilty but the system, based on century-old outdated laws, has led to harassment of people by the government agencies and also put pressure on the judiciary.\nInefficiency in justice delivery: The system takes years to bring justice and has ceased to deter criminals. There is a lack of synergy among the judiciary, the prosecution and the police. A large number of guilty go unpunished in a large number of cases. On the contrary, many innocent people remain as undertrail prisoners as well. As per NCRB data, 67.2% of our total prison population comprises of undertrials prisoners.\n\nComplex nature of the crime: Crime has increased rapidly and the nature of crimes are becoming more and more complex due to technological innovations.\nInvestigation incapability: It led to delay in or haphazard investigation of crimes which greatly contribute to the delay in dispensing prompt justice.\nInequality in the justice: The rich and the powerful hardly get convicted, even in cases of serious crimes. Also, the growing nexus between crime and politics has added a new dimension to the crime scenario.\nThe lowered confidence of common man: The judicial procedures have become complicated and expensive. There is a rise in cases of mob violence.\nRecommendation of the Malimath Committee\n\nSome of the important recommendations of the committee were:\n\nCourts and Judges: There is a need for more judges in the country.\nNational Judicial Commission: The Constitution of a National Judicial Commission to deal with the appointment of judges to the higher courts and amending Article 124 to make impeachment of judges less difficult.\nSeparate criminal division in higher courts: The higher courts should have a separate criminal division consisting of judges who have specialised in criminal law.\nThe inquisitorial system of investigation:\u00a0The Inquisitorial system is practised in countries such as Germany and France should be followed.\nPower for court to summon any person: Court\u2019s power to summon any person, whether or not listed as a witness if it felt necessary.\nRight to silence:\u00a0A modification to Article 20 (3) of the Constitution that protects the accused from being compelled to be a witness against himself/herself. The court should be given freedom to question the accused to elicit information and draw an adverse inference against the accused in case the latter refuses to answer.\nThe right of accused: A schedule to the Code be brought out in all regional languages to make accused aware of his/her rights, as well as how to enforce them.\nPresumption of Innocence: The courts follow \u201cproof beyond reasonable doubt\u201d as the basis to convict an accused in criminal cases which is an unreasonable burden on the prosecution and hence a fact should be considered as proven \u201cif the court is convinced that it is true\u201d after evaluating the matters before it.\nJustice to the victims: The victim should be allowed to participate in cases involving serious crimes and also be given adequate compensation. If the victim is dead, the legal representative shall have the right to implead himself or herself as a party, in case of serious offences. The State should provide an advocate of victim\u2019s choice to plead on his/her behalf and the cost has to be borne by the state if the victim can\u2019t afford it.\nVictim Compensation Fund: A Victim Compensation Fund can be created under the victim compensation law and the assets confiscated from organised crimes can be made part of the fund.\nPolice Investigation: Hiving off the investigation wing of Law and Order\nNational Security Commission and State Security Commissions: Setting up of a National Security Commission and State Security Commissions.\nSP in each district: Appointment of an SP in each district to maintain crime data, an organisation of specialised squads to deal with organised crime.\nDirector of Prosecution: A new post, Director of Prosecution, should be created in every state to facilitate effective coordination between the investigating and prosecuting officers.\nWitness protection: The dying declarations, confessions, and audio/video recorded statements of witnesses should be authorised by law. There should be a strong witness protection mechanism.\u00a0Witnesses should be treated with dignity.\nArrears Eradication Scheme: To settle those cases which are pending for more than two years through Lok Adalat on a priority basis.\nOffences classification: It should be changed to the social welfare code, correctional code, criminal code, and economic and other offences code instead of the current classification of cognisable and non-cognisable.\nSubstitution of death sentence: Substitute with imprisonment for life without commutation or remission.\nCentral law for organized crime and terrorism: Though crime is a state subject, a central law must be enacted to deal with organised crime, federal crimes, and terrorism.\nPeriodic review: A Presidential Commission was recommended for a periodical review of the functioning of the Criminal Justice System.\nKey issues in the recommendations\nMalimath Committee report recommends making confessions made to a senior police officer (SP rank or above)\u00a0admissible as evidence. Confessions to police have repeatedly come under scrutiny because of allegations of custodial torture, instances of custodial deaths, fake encounters and tampering with evidence.\nThe report recommends diluting the standard of proof lower than the current \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 standard. It means that if a proof is enough to convince the court that something is true, then it can be considered as a standard proof. Such a measure would have adverse implications on suspects and requires considerable deliberation.\nReforms undertaken by the Government\nThe government has implemented a number of recommendations like\u00a0permitting videography of statements, the definition of rape has been expanded and new offences against women have been added. The\u00a0victim compensation is now a part of the law.\nThe Government is in the process to\u00a0draft a new Memorandum of Procedure\u00a0(MoP)\u00a0for the appointment of High Court and Supreme Court Judges.\nThe government has removed more than 1000 obsolete laws which came in the way of smooth administration.\nThe Government has given its approval for implementation of an umbrella scheme of \u2018Modernisation of Police Forces\u2019\u00a0with proper use of technology.\nThe Gram Nyayalayas and Lok Adalats were established to provide access to justice to the citizens at their doorsteps.\nThe Legal Service Authority Act was enacted by the Parliament with an object to provide free and competent legal service to the weaker section of society.\nWay Forward\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt is a good idea to revisit the committee recommendations with a view to considering their possible implementation. However, the reforms should be made with care and after proper debate. The provisions like diluting the standard of proof or considering confession to senior police as evidence must be properly debated.\n\nSupreme Court had already set guidelines for how the prosecution and the police should function to get justice to the victims and punish the guilty.\n\nRevamping the CJS should not undermine the principles on which the justice system was founded. The rules and procedures are needed to be simplified to make it convenient for the common man. The primary focus must be on police reforms, appointing more judges, deploying scientific techniques, beefing up forensic labs, and other infrastructure investments are the need of the hour.\n\nRead:\u00a0Revised Criminal Laws\n\nArticle by: Alok Kumar"

The share of the Scheduled Tribe population in urban areas is a meagre 2.8%.\nMadhya Pradesh, Maharastra, Orissa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, and Karnataka are the State having a larger number of Scheduled Tribes These states account for 83.2% of the total Scheduled Tribe population of the country. Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Jammu & Kashmir, Tripura, Mizoram, Bihar, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, accounting for another 15.3% of the total Scheduled Tribe population. The share of the remaining states / Uts is negligible.\nThe Scheduled Tribes in India form the largest proportion of the total population in Lakshadweep and Mizoram followed by Nagaland and Meghalaya.\nMadhya Pradesh has the largest number of scheduled Tribes followed by Orissa.\nBastar district of Chattisgarh consists of the largest number of Scheduled Tribes.\nThere are no Scheduled Tribes in Punjab, Delhi, Chandigarh, Pondicherry, Haryana.\nIn Lok Sabha, there is a reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes. Here also census figures are taken into account. Allocation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha are made on the basis of the proportion of Scheduled Tribes in the State concerned to that of the total population, vide provision contained in Article 330 of the Constitution of India read with Section 3 of the R. P. Act, 1950.\nFor Scheduled Tribes, 47 seats are reserved in Lok Sabha. The 1st schedule to R. P. Act, 1950\u00a0 as amended vide Representation of People (Amendment) Act, 2008 gives the Statewise break up\nScheduled Tribes\n\nArticle 366 (25) defined scheduled tribes as \u201csuch tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342 to be Scheduled Tribes for the purposes of this constitution\u201d.\n\nArticle 342 in The Constitution Of India 1949\n\nScheduled Tribes\n\n(1) The President may with respect to any State or Union territory, and where it is a State, after consultation with the Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within tribes or tribal communities which shall for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Tribes in relation to that State or Union territory, as the case may be\n\n(2) Parliament may by law include in or exclude from the list of Scheduled Tribes specified in a notification issued under clause ( 1 ) any tribe or tribal community or part of or group within any tribe or tribal community, but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification PART XVII OFFICIAL LANGUAGE CHAPTER I LANGUAGE OF THE UNION.\n\nMinistry of Tribal Affairs\n\nThe Ministry of Tribal Affairs is responsible for the overall development of the scheduled tribes in India. This Ministry was set up in 1999 after the bifurcation of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment with the objective of providing a more focused approach on the integrated socio-economic development of the Scheduled Tribes (STs), the most underprivileged of the Indian Society, in a coordinated and planned manner.\n\nThe Ministry of Tribal Affairs shall be the nodal Ministry for overall policy, planning and coordination of programmes of development for the Scheduled Tribes. In regard to sectoral programmes and schemes of development of these communities policy, planning, monitoring, evaluation etc. as also, their coordination will be the responsibility of the concerned Central Ministries/ Departments, State Governments and Union Territory Administrations. Each Central Ministry/Department will be the nodal Ministry or Department concerning its sector.\n\nBefore the formation of the Ministry, tribal affairs were handled by different Ministries as follows:\n\nAs a Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs named as \u2018Tribal Division\u2019 since independence up to September 1985.\nMinistry of Welfare: From September 1985 to May 1998.\nMinistry of Social Justice & Empowerment from May 1998 to September 1999.\nNational Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST)\n\nThe National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) was established by amending Article 338 and inserting a new Article 338A in the Constitution through the Constitution (89th Amendment) Act, 2003. By this amendment, the erstwhile National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was replaced by two separate Commissions namely- (i) the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), and (ii) the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) w.e.f. 19 February 2004.\n\nThe Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) strategy\n\nThe Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) strategy is a Government of India initiative aimed for the rapid socio-economic development of tribal people. The funds provided under the Tribal Sub Plan of the State have to be at least equal in proportion to the ST population of each State or UTs.\n\nSimilarly, Central Ministries/Departments are also required to earmark funds out of their budget for the Tribal Sub-Plan. As per guidelines issued by the Planning Commission, the Tribal Sub Plan funds are to be non-divertible and non-lapsable.\n\nThe National Commission for Scheduled Tribes is vested with the duty to participate and advise in the planning process of socio-economic development of STs, and to evaluate the progress of their development under the Union and any State.\n\nReference:\n\nMinistry of Tribal Affairs\nMinistry of Law and Justice\nCensusIndia\n\nRelated article:\u00a0De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)\n\nArticle by: Priyanka Sunil"

Many atrocities have been committed against them since time immemorial.\u00a0The SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act protects them against discrimination and atrocities.\n\nHowever, the SC/ST act can never be called a successful legislation. Dalits and Tribals still face discrimination. On the other side, there is widespread concern over misuse of the provisions of the Act against innocent persons.\n\nAs per the Supreme Court of India, the SC/ST act has become an instrument of \u201cblackmail\u201d and is being used by some to exact \u201cvengeance\u201d and satisfy vested interests.\n\nIn this post, we will analyse both sides, recent issues, and the court rulings.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCrimes against SC/ST \u2013 Atrocities of various forms\n1.

So in many instances, the case is registered under IPC or CrPC than PoA.\n\n1. Cow vigilantism\nThe term \u201cCow vigilantism\u201d is used to describe the lawlessness happening under the name of Cow protection.\nDalits and Muslims are at the receiving end of this vigilantism.\nSince Dalits are concentrated in the occupation of leather making from hides of the cow, they are invariably targeted by vigilantes.\nCow vigilantism has increased since past two years.\n2. Honour killing\nIn a society like India, where caste structures are still dominant in the form of endogamy, honour killings are prevalent on a wide scale.\nDalits are almost always at the receiving end of the violence.\nIn Lata Singh vs. the State of UP, Supreme Court has opined that inter-caste marriages are in the national interest as they destroy the caste system.\nBhagwan Dass v. Delhi deemed honour killings in the \u201crarest of rare\u201d category of crimes that deserve the death penalty.\n3. Social boycott\nKhap panchayat \u2013 caste panchayat often acts as an arena for perpetuating atrocities against Dalits by ostracizing them from the society\nAmbedkar\u00a0had recognized the atrocities meting out to Dalits in the form of social boycott. He had often fought against the practice\nMahad satyagraha for the opening of community tanks for Dalits\nHe proposed an anti-boycott law\nHe recognized that discrimination occurs in multiple axes like boycott-stigmatization-segregation and try to fight it out on all these axes\nMaharashtra enacted a law against a social boycott: Maharashtra Prohibition of People from Social Boycott (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2016.\nNeed a comprehensive anti-discrimination law in\u00a0lines of civil rights entitlements in US-UK.\nLaw Commission drafted the Prohibition of Unlawful Assembly (Interference with the Freedom of Matrimonial Alliances) Bill, 2011 that sought to declare khap panchayats unlawful.\n4. Caste clashes\nIn rural India, OBC became dominant caste by ousting upper caste due to\nThey were able to convert their numerical strength into political force once universal adult franchise came.\nPost-Indian rural development model was favourable to them: Land reforms, the green revolution etc.\nOn the other hand, the Post-Independent development model didn\u2019t result in the upward mobility of Dalits. Thus OBCs became the new oppressor of Dalits in place of traditional upper castes.\nPost-1990 reforms, there was a resurgence among Dalits due to\nreservation policy led to the emergence of the middle class among Dalits who spearheaded Dalit movements.\nIdentity politics, from leaders among Dalits themselves, began to express itself.\nurbanization and other opportunities followed by 1990 reforms lead to improvement in Dalits life\nThis resurgence was met with violent clashes among upper castes/OBCs and Dalits.\nMany scholars like Surinder.S.Jodhka have attributed the increased atrocities to the tensions caused between upper castes and Dalits due to the perceived upward mobility of Dalits.\nBut Dalits were at the receiving end of almost all these atrocities like\nKhairlanji massacre in Maharashtra 2008\nBhima-Koregaon violence in Maharashtra 2017\nUna violence\n5. Discrimination in universities\nThe suicide of Rohit Vemula in Hyderabad 2016\nExamples of atrocities in independent India\nKizhavenmani, Tamil Nadu (1958) in which 44 SCs were burnt to death in a confined building because SC agricultural labourers sought a little raise in their very low wages. The high court acquitted all the accused.\nKaramchedu, Andhra Pradesh, 1984: Five SCs were massacred. The trial court convicted many of the accused. The high court acquitted all. The Supreme Court upheld the trial court judgment \u2013 a clear example that acquittals do not mean false cases.\nTsunduru, Andhra Pradesh, 1991: Eight SCs were massacred. The trial court convicted the accused in 2007. The high court acquitted them in 2014. The Supreme Court has admitted a special leave petition (SLP) of the surviving victims and survivors of victims.\nSix cases of Bihar including the Bathani Tola (1996) and Laxmanpur Bathe (1997). In most of these, the trial court convicted the accused. In all of these, the high court acquitted the accused. Appeals are pending in the Supreme Court.\nKambalapalli, Karnataka. The prime witness in this case, who is the sole survivor and head of the family whose other members were massacred, turned \u201chostile\u201d due to a threat of life, resulting in the acquittal of all the accused.\nAre all crimes against Dalits based on caste discriminations?\n\nThere are many nuanced and subtle form of atrocities that are meted out to SC/ST. Since these are highly intertwined with common IPC/CrPC crimes, it is quite complex to dissect caste discriminations from everyday occurrences of violence.\n\nEvery passing day there will be one or other incidents of atrocities against SC/ST. In fact, everyday life of them is a struggle against entrenched atrocities, as they are facing discrimination from every facet of life, be it may be in the field of education, employment, in all the limbs of the state and institutions.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSince Dalits are widespread and live in close vicinity to other castes, atrocities against them are more frequent and more visible. Tribals are concentrated in some areas and are more isolated from other sections of society.\n\nThe government has introduced many measures for preventing these atrocities, especially under the aegis of Article 17. Most important among them is PoA act, which was and is a watershed act for tilting the power balance of society. Its implementation has seen many stumbling blocks leading to many atrocities against Dalits as shown above. These atrocities are widespread throughout the breadth of the nation.\n\nResistance from Dalits against atrocities against them\n\nOne notable change during present times is the resistance cropping from among the Dalits itself rather than being passive recipients of atrocities as in earlier times. Bhim army is one such example.\n\nAlso, many youth leaders from the community are cropping up, inspired by and reinventing Ambedkar, since the 1990s. Jignesh Mevani is an example.\n\nAs the community is exerting their independence and resisting against injustices, PoA act is the main tool in their arsenal. But judicial observation in Kashinath Mahajan case\u00a0may prove detrimental in this respect by impinging a final nail in the coffin of the act, which was always accused of being misused since its inception.\n\nGovernment actions against atrocities\n\nIndian Constitution, Indian Parliament, and various state legislatures have stringent provisions against atrocities targeting SCs or STs.\n\nIndian Constitution\nArticle 17 seeks to abolish \u2018untouchability\u2019.\nthe institution of \u2018untouchability\u2019 refers not just to the avoidance or prohibition of physical contact but to a much broader set of social sanctions.\nArticle 46 \u2013 \u00a0promote the educational and economic interests of SCs, STs, and other weaker sections of the society and to protect them from social injustice and exploitation\nArticle 338 \u2013\u00a0National Commission for Scheduled Castes\nIts functions include among others:\ninvestigate and monitor all matters relating to the constitutional and other legal safeguards for the SCs and to evaluate their working;\ninquire into specific complaints with respect to the deprivation of rights and safeguards of the SCs;\n338-A \u2013\u00a0National Commission for\u00a0Scheduled Tribes\nIts functions are same as that of NCSC, but with respect to ST than SC\nState Actions\nSchedules listing the castes and tribes recognized as deserving of special treatment because of the massive discrimination practised against them. This was drawn up in colonial times as 1935 act introduced Scheduled\u00a0caste and Scheduled tribe categories\u00a0\nAfter Independence, the same policies have been continued and many new ones added.\nScheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and Rules, 1995\nThoratt committee 2007 \u2013 first ever committee constituted to study caste discrimination in higher education sector.\nHRD ministry fails to implement Thorat committee recommendations.\nSC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (POA Act 1989)\n\nArticle 17 seeks to abolish \u2018untouchability\u2019\nUntouchability (Offences) Act 1955 was enacted\nThe lacuna in the above act lead to the passing of Protection of Civil Rights Act\u00a01976\nnormal provisions of the existing laws:\u00a0Protection of Civil Rights Act,\u00a0Indian Penal Code, were inadequate to check many dimensions of atrocities meted to SC/ST. This lead to\u00a0Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and Rules, 1995.\nThe Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act is known as POA, SC/ST Act, the Prevention of Atrocities Act, or the Atrocities Act.\n\nThe provisions of SC/ST Act can be divided into three categories:-\n\nprovisions of criminal law.\nCreation of new types of offences not in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or in the Protection of Civil Rights Act 1955 (PCRA).\nAtrocities can be committed only by non-SCs and non-STs on members of the SC or ST communities. Crimes among SCs and STs or between STs and SCs do not come under the purview of this Act.\nDefines various types of atrocities against SCs/STs and prescribes stringent punishments for the same.\nEnhanced minimum punishment for public servants.\nPunishment for neglect of duties by a public servant(Section 4)\nCancellation of arms licenses in the areas identified where an atrocity may take place or has taken place and grant arms licenses to SCs and STs\nDenial of anticipatory bail (Section 18) provided in Section 438 of the CrPC\nDenial of probation to convict (Section 19).\nprovisions for relief and compensation for victims\nprovisions that establish special authorities for the implementation and monitoring of the Act.\nCreation of Special Courts and special public prosecutor\u00a0\nMandatory, periodic monitoring system at District, State and National level\nIdentification of atrocity prone areas\u00a0\nNHRC report on the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act\nThe indifference of society, lopsided implementation of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989, lack of political will in removing the historical injustices faced by this section of society has been detrimental to them.\nThe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015\nAmends existing categories and adds new categories of actions to be treated as offences.\nOffences in case of sexual exploiting of SC or ST woman: (i) Using acts, words or gestures of a sexual\u00a0nature against SC/ST woman. (ii) Touching an SC/ST woman intentionally in a sexual manner without her consent (iii) Practice of dedicating an SC/ST women\u00a0as a devadasi to a temple\u2026\nNew offences: (a) garlanding with footwear, (b) compelling to dispose or carry human or animal carcasses, or do manual scavenging, (c) abusing SCs or STs by caste name in public, (d) attempting to promote feelings of ill-will against SCs or STs or disrespecting any deceased person held in high esteem, and (e) imposing or threatening a social or economic\u00a0boycott.\nPreventing SCs or STs from undertaking the following activities will be considered an offence: (a) using common property resources, (c) entering any place of worship that is open to the public, and (d) entering an education or health institution\nPresumption to the offences:\u00a0If the accused was acquainted with the victim or his family, the court will presume that the accused was aware of the caste or tribal identity of the victim unless proved otherwise.\nThe act specifies the duties of public servants\nUnder the earlier Act, a court of Session at the district level is deemed a Special Court\nAmendment specifies that an Exclusive Special Court and\u00a0 exclusive Special Public Prosecutor\u00a0must be provided at the district level\nSpecial courts must be established where offences are less in number\ncases should be disposed of within two months\nAdds a chapter on the rights of victims and witness.\nThe duty of the state to make arrangements for the protection of victims, their, and witnesses.\nSubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs The State of Maharashtra [Review of\u00a0SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act ]\nSupreme Court opined that SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (PoA act) is being misused and checks are needed to prevent such misuse.\nThe act has become a tool to persecute innocents and public servants for political and personal gains.\nProvided guidelines for preventing the misuse of the act.\nPreliminary inquiry at the level of DSP is required to verify the authenticity of the case before registering FIR.\nA person can be released on anticipatory bail unless a prima facie case of crimes or atrocities is made out.\nNo FIR should be registered against government servants without the approval of the appointing authority.\nPoA act had to be interpreted in a manner which will ensure that \u201ccasteism is not perpetuated\u201d through the implementation of the law.\nCritical analysis of the Judgment in\u00a0Subhash Kashinath Mahajan Case on\u00a0SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act\n\nMany law experts are of the view that this judgement is without considering the\u00a0socio-cultural realities of caste atrocities.\nThe judgement didn\u2019t give any statistical pieces of evidence but relied on several High Court judgements.\nIt equated high rate of acquittals to a large number of false cases.\nBut increasing acquittal can\u2019t be the reason for the case being false.\nEntrenched discrimination and prejudice of the establishment are one of the reasons of acquittals.\nAnother reason can be intimidation of victims, their survivors, and witnesses by various means including a social and economic boycott.\nThe constitutional validity of exclusion of anticipatory bail had been upheld in\u00a0Kartar Singh case.\nThe case has clarified that anticipatory bail is a statutory right and not comes under Right to Life.\nSection 18 of the PoA act especially excludes anticipatory bail.\nThe court while upholding ideals of personal liberty and innocence until pronounced guilty, have ignored the socio-cultural reality of caste system in India.\nIn Lalita Kumari vs Government of Uttar Pradesh,\u00a0the Supreme Court directed that prompt registration of FIR is mandatory under Section 154 of the Cr.P.C. if the information discloses commission of a cognisable offence and no preliminary enquiry is permissible in such a situation. Mahajan judgement ignores this precedent.\nDilution of PoA act will have a crippling effect on social justice.\nBecause of the juxtaposition of the powerful and the powerless in India\u2019s caste system in every village, it is very difficult to secure proper investigation and quick and successful trial.\nDelay in investigation and trial result in intimidation of victims and witnesses.\nWill make the act toothless, roll back social transformation.\nThis case treads to break the thin line between\u00a0judicial activism and judicial over-reach.\nSupreme Court in Rajesh Sharma vs the State of Uttar Pradesh,\u00a0assumed misuse of the anti-dowry provision of Section 498A in IPC, but CJI revisited the case remarking that the court cannot write law but can only interpret a law that is ambiguous or silent on certain aspects, and not when it is crystal-clear.\nSC had earlier directed\u00a0national legal service authority to give\u00a0legal awareness and free consultation to the community for making most out of the legal safeguards provided to them.\nWith the perceived upward mobility of SCs, there has been a growing demand among dominant and upper castes to dilute PoA act like that of the demand by Marathas. This judgment can be used as a plank by these castes to further their agenda.\nReport of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes for 2015-16 states that there has been an increase in the number of incidence of atrocities but a decrease in conviction rates.\nNCRB data: The number of cases of atrocities against SC/St has increased from 2008 to 2016 but there was a decline in conviction rate at the same time.\nBut there are instances of misuse of the act by SC/STs, especially against public officials. This has lead to many bogus cases under PoA act. This claim has been validated by Parliamentary Standing Committee report, which has sought an inbuilt provision in the PoA act to safeguard those who are falsely accused.\nRecent Protests and the Review Petition against the Supreme Court Judgement\n\nThere was a national strike by Dalits against the judgment which turned violent leading to loss of lives. The Center has given review petition against the judgment. However, the Supreme Court has refused to keep in abeyance its earlier order preventing automatic arrests on complaints filed under the SC/ST Act.\n\nPolitical parties started blame-game and grandstanding, to make mileage out of the issue for 2019 elections. But amidst all this cacophony, the real issue should not be crowded out.\n\nPoA act is a transformative act and a \u2018Brahmastra\u2019 in the arsenal of hapless Dalits to fight their historically asymmetrical war of subjugation. It should be strengthened through proper implementation. But safeguards should also be inserted to protect innocents from being falsely persecuted. This could happen only through debates between all stakeholders.\n\nSubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs The State of Maharashtra judgment should be used as an opportunity to look into this dimension rather than weakening the act. But the most important thing for ending discrimination and improving fraternity is a persistent societal action to change the entrenched caste rigidity. SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (PoA act) as a tool in this endeavour rather than an end in itself.\n\nThough independent Indian state has introduced many measures to curb the atrocities and usher in socio-economic justice, the results are often not satisfactory. Legislations have been passed repeatedly on this subject is proof of the fact that the law alone cannot end this social practice.\n\nBy socio-cultural upliftment of SC/ST through their meaningful integration into society, by giving adequate capacity building opportunities through education, employment etc. must be the end of this struggle.\n\nReferences: Wikipedia, Indian Express, The Wire, The Hindu, Firstpost, Laxmikant\n\nArticle by: Sethu\u00a0Krishnan M"

The bill facilitates reservation for EWS in direct recruitments in jobs and admission in higher educational institutions.\n\nThe reservation of EWS of general category will be given without tampering the existing quotas for SC, ST and OBCs people.\n\nThe bill is expected to benefit a huge section of upper castes including Brahmins, Rajputs (Thakurs), Jats, Marathas, Bhumihars, and several trading castes including Kapus and Kammas.\n\nWhat will the \u201cEconomically Weaker Sections Quota bill\u201d amend in the Indian Constitution?\n\nArticle 15 and Article 16 of the Indian Constitution.\n\nAmendment to Article 15 (Reservation in Educational Institutions)\n\nIn article 15 of the Constitution, after clause (5), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:\u2014\n\u2018(6) Nothing in this article or sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of article 19 or clause (2) of article 29 shall prevent the State from making,\u2014 any special provision for the advancement of any economically weaker sections of citizens other than the classes mentioned in clauses (4) and (5) in so far as such special provisions relate to their admission to educational institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of article 30, which in the case of reservation would be in addition to the existing reservations and subject to a maximum of ten per cent\u00a0of the total seats in each category.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAmendment to Article 16\u00a0(Reservation in Jobs)\n\nIn article 16 of the Constitution, after clause (5), the following clause shall be\ninserted, namely:\u2014 \u201c(6) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any economically weaker\u00a0sections of citizens other than the classes mentioned in clause (4), in addition to the existing reservation and subject to a maximum of ten per cent\u00a0of the posts in each category.\u201d.\n\nWho comes under the \u201cEconomically Weaker Sections\u201d?\n\nFor the purposes of article 15 and article 16, \u201ceconomically weaker sections\u201d shall be such as may be notified by the State from time to time on the basis of family income and other indicators of economic disadvantage.\u2019\n\nCentral Government of India has specified certain criteria for identifying the EWS.\n\nHowever, the Union Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said\u00a0the states will have the freedom to decide on income criterion of beneficiaries under the bill.\n\nThis will be a class distinct from the already specified classes of SCs, STs and socially and educationally backward classes (OBCs).\n\nReservation in India \u2013 The Present and the Future\u2026\n\nAt present, reservations in India\u00a0account for a total of 49.5%. If the 10% extra reservation for EWS is also taken into account, it would be 59.5%.\n\n7.5%, 15%, and 27% quotas are reserved for Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, and Other Backward Classes respectively.\n\nIf the EWS Quota Bill becomes an Act, only 40.5% of seats will be allocated in educational institutions/jobs based on the merit of candidates. As pointed by the Supreme Court, an increase in reservations can compromise the merit.\n\nRemember, the merit quota is not reserved anyone \u2013 not even for the general category (hence the name \u2013 merit). It is open to candidates from all categories \u2013 including SC, ST, OBC, and the General category \u2013 who qualify on merit (and not because of reservation).\n\nEWS Quota bill in Lok Sabha\n\nThe bill needed a special majority to pass. With the support of the ruling party and opposition parties, Lok Sabha has passed the Constitution 124th Amendment Bill, on 08-01-2019, the same day it was introduced in the House.\n\n323 members voted in favour of the bill, while three voted against it. AIADMK staged a walkout before the voting.\n\nEWS Quota bill in Rajya Sabha\n\nThe Rajya Sabha too passed the Constitution (124th Amendment) Bill, 2019 on the same day it was introduced (09-01-2019). Being a\u00a0constitution amendment bill, it had to be passed with a two-thirds majority in Rajya Sabha.\n\nDuring division on the bill in the Rajya Sabha, 165 members voted in favour of it while seven members voted against. The motion moved by AIADMK, left parties and others to refer the bill to the Select Committee was negated.\n\nThe EWS Quota Bill Gets President\u2019s assent, becomes Act\n\nAs both houses of the Parliament has passed the Constitution 124th (Amendment) Bill, 2019, it was sent to the President of India for his assent.\u00a0President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to a bill on 12-01-2019.\n\nThe legislation will now be known as the Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, 2019.\n\nDoes the bill need the approval of more than 50% state assemblies?\n\nThe bill does not need the approval of State Assemblies.\n\nWas economic reservation, a policy, present on the election manifesto of Indian National Congress in 2014?\n\nYes.\n\nRead the INC election manifesto below.\n\nThe Indian National Congress is committed to finding a way forward for introducing reservation in education and employment for economically weaker sections of all communities without in any way affecting existing reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.\n\nIt was a Congress promise. However, INC didn\u2019t mention the details of their plan or percentage of the quota. Despite not being on the BJP\u2019s election promise, the NDA government came forward with the reservation for EWS, just before the 2019 election.\n\nShould India need\u00a0reservation?\n\nIt\u2019s the duty of the government to provide equality of status and opportunity in India.\n\nReservation is one of the tools against social oppression and injustice against certain classes. Otherwise known as affirmative action, reservation helps in uplifting backward classes.\n\nHowever, reservation is just one of the methods for social upliftment. There are many other methods like providing scholarships, funds, coachings, and other welfare schemes.\n\nThe way reservation is implemented and executed in India is largely governed by vote-bank politics.\n\nIndian Consitution allowed reservation only for socially and educationally backward classes. However, in India, it became caste-based reservation instead of class-based reservation.\n\nInitially, the reservation was intended only for SC/ST communities \u2013 that too for a period of 10 years (1951-1961). However, it got extended ever since. After the implementation of Mandal Commission report in 1990, the scope of the reservation was widened to include Other Backward Communities (OBCs).\n\nThe benefits of the reservation were successively enjoyed only by a few communities (or families), excluding the truly deserving ones. Even 70 years after independence, the demand for reservation has only increased.\n\nNow, with the introduction of economic criteria for reservation, in addition to the caste-criteria which already existed, things have become more complicated.\n\nUnequals should not be treated equally, but is reservation the only solution?\n\nThere is no doubt that unequals should not be treated equally. However, is the current system of unequal treatment perfect? Is it creating more injustice? Is it the only way out in a welfare-nation? It\u2019s time to introspect.\n\nReservation based entirely on economic criteria is not an all-in-one solution, though family income can be one of the parameters. Also, its time to fix a time period for the reservation system \u2013 rather than extending it to eternity.\n\nDenying India, the service of the meritorious candidates, who see them being overtaken by others with lesser academic performance or brilliance, is also a crime and injustice.\n\nAren\u2019t there\u00a0any alternative mechanisms to uplift the marginalised so that everyone gets equal opportunities? How is affirmative action done in other countries?\n\nReforms in the reservation system of India is the need of the hour. However, as the subject of reservation revolves around a lot of votes, parties are reluctant to disrupt the existing system.\n\nGovernment\u2019s view\n\nReacting to the passage of the bill in Lok Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, it is a landmark moment in the nation\u2019s history and an effective measure that ensures justice for all sections of society.\n\nFinance minister Arun Jaitley, building the case for the 10 per cent quota, said, \u201cIf two individuals are not equal due to birth or for economic reasons, then they cannot be treated equally. Unequals cannot be treated equally,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further contended that the 50% cap on reservations imposed by the Supreme Court was only\u00a0for caste-based reservations, and the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) reservation won\u2019t be impacted by it.\n\nUnion Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thaawarchand Gehlot said the similar state laws for EWS quota were quashed by Courts because there was no provision for economic reservation in the Constitution before.\u00a0 Now, the Law will not be struck down by the Supreme Court if challenged as it has been brought by making required provisions in the Constitution.\n\nUpdate: The government may bring another bill to provide relaxations for EWS of General Category in the government jobs with respect to the upper age limit, number of attempts, and cut-off marks, similar to OBCs.\n\nOpposition Parties View\n\nThe Congress said it supported the bill, but doubted the government\u2019s intentions as it was \u201cgimmick\u201d aimed at political gains in upcoming elections.\n\nVarious parties, including the BSP, SP, TDP and DMK, also called it the BJP\u2019s poll stunt but welcomed the move.\n\nKV Thomas of the Congress said, his party is not against the concept of the bill and supports it, but the way it has been brought, raises several questions on the sincerity of the government. He alleged that the government has brought the bill without proper homework.\u00a0The Congress said it would prefer a parliamentary committee to look into the matter.\n\nAsaduddin Owaisi\u2019s AIMIM said they opposed the bill. So did Tamil Nadu\u2019s ruling AIADMK, which walked out of the house ahead of the voting. AIADMK\u2019s Mr Thambi Durai said, \u201cHave government schemes for the poor failed? There are enough schemes. This reservation bill which you are bringing will be struck down by the Supreme Court\u201d.\n\nWill Supreme Court consider the 124th Constitutional Amendment Bill as valid?\n\nExcept in a few states like Tamil Nadu, the cap of reservation is 50%. This limit is set by the Supreme Court to avoid the vote-bank politics of providing quotas thus compromising the merit.\u00a0Tamil Nadu has a law which provides for 69% reservations, which has been inserted into the ninth schedule of Constitution to immunize it from judicial review.\n\nA nine-judge bench decision of the SC in the Indira Sawhney case(1992) had capped the upper limit of reservation at 50%. The Indira Sawhney case had further held that social backwardness cannot be determined only with reference to an economic criterion.\n\nSo the limits imposed by the nine-judge bench in 1992 would be the major litmus test for this bill. If the same standards are upheld by the Supreme Court, the 124th Constitutional Amendment Bill will be declared null and void.\n\nThe Gujarat Government had already brought an ordinance to provide 10% quota for EWS in the forward castes. However, in August 2016, the Gujarat High Court had quashed this ordinance. The appeal against that judgment is pending in the Supreme Court.\n\nRead:\u00a0Maratha Quota Law"

The temple is managed by the Travancore Devaswom Board.\n\nMain stakeholders of Sabarimala Temple are Travancore Devasom Board, Tantri (head priest) family, Pandalam Royal Family, Ayyappa Seva Sangam etc.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe shrine at Sabarimala is an ancient temple of\u00a0Ayyappan\u00a0also known as\u00a0Sasta\u00a0and\u00a0Dharmasasta.\n\nLord Ayyappan is worshipped as a \u2018Naishtika Bramhachari\u2019 or a celibate for life. Therefore, as per a notification by the Devaswom Board that manages the temple, women belonging to the menstruating age are not permitted to enter the temple.\n\nThe devotees are expected to follow a\u00a0Vratham\u00a0(41-day austerity period) prior to the pilgrimage. About 2 crore devotees visit the pilgrimage centre every year.\n\nThe Supreme Court Verdict on Sabarimala Women Entry Issue in 2018\n\nThe Supreme Court verdict on September 28, 2018, paved the way for the entry of women of all ages into the Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala in Kerala.\n\nThe five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, in its 4:1 verdict, said banning the entry of women into the shrine is gender discrimination and the practice violates the rights of Hindu women. It said religion is a way of life basically to link life with divinity.\n\nThe court observed that it can\u2019t be oblivious to the fact of the case that a class of women is disallowed due to physiological reasons (menstruation).\n\nThe CJI said devotion cannot be subjected to discrimination and patriarchal notion cannot be allowed to trump equality in devotion. While Justices R F Nariman and D Y Chandrachud concurred with the CJI and Justice A M Khanwilkar, Justice Indu Malhotra gave a dissenting verdict.\n\nIronically, in the 4-1 verdict on Indian Young Lawyers Association & Others vs The State of Kerala & Others, the only dissenting vote was of the sole woman judge on the bench: Justice Indu Malhotra.\n\nJustice Malhotra, in her dissenting judgement, said that issues which have deep religious connotation should not be tinkered with to maintain a secular atmosphere in the country.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court verdict \u2013 that the Sabarimala temple must be thrown open to women of all ages \u2013 should be seen as another victory for the cause of gender equality.\n\nUpdate (13-11-18) \u2013\u00a0The Supreme Court on 13-11-2018 admitted all 49 review petitions seeking revisit of its September 28 order to allow women of all age groups inside the Sabarimala temple.\u00a0The court has however not ordered any stay on its earlier verdict allowing women entry into the hill shrine. The apex court will hear the 49 petitions on January 22, 2019.\n\nSabarimala Temple \u2013 Views of Those Who Support Women Entry\n\nPreventing women from entering the places of worship goes against Articles 14, 15, 19, and 25 of the Indian constitution, which deal with the right to equality, the right against discrimination based on gender, freedom of movement and freedom of religion.\nThe excluded women claim that barring them access to the inner sanctum of the shrine violated their fundamental right under Article 25(1) to freely practice their religion.\nRight to manage its own religious affairs under Article 26(1) cannot \u201coverride the right to practice religion itself\u201d, as Article 26 cannot be seen to overrule the right to practice one\u2019s religion as guaranteed under the Constitution of India.\nRestricting the entry of women into places of worship is one of the ways of imposing patriarchy. Often the restrictions are based on patriarchy and not religion.\nBanning entry to the temple is discriminatory since it subverts the idea of everyone being equal to God.\nFrom the abolition of Sati to temple entry proclamation to the abolition of untouchability, reforms have been judicial or legislative.\nIn April 2016, the Shani Shingnapur temple, which had barred women from entering its core area for over 400 years, allowed women to pray inside the temple following the court\u2019s orders.\nSabarimala Temple \u2013 Views of Those Who Oppose Women Entry\n\n[click_to_tweet tweet=\u201dWhile some argue that women are barred from entering the Sabarimala temple to preserve \u2018purity\u2019, others bring the element of celibacy of the diety Ayyappa as the main argument against. \u201d quote=\u201dWhile some argue that women are barred from entering the Sabarimala temple to preserve \u2018purity\u2019, others bring the element of celibacy of the diety Ayyappa as the main argument against. \u201c]\n\nWomen are banned from entering the temples to preserve \u2018purity\u2019. The reason cited in Sabarimala case is that women during their menstruation period are not supposed to enter places of worship.\nReferring to the presiding deity Lord Ayyappa as a Naishtika Bramhachari, many point out that it is the celibate nature of the deity that forms the basis of the practice and not misogyny.\nSabarimala was a separate religious cult with its own rules.\nArticle 15 of the Constitution does not apply to religious institutions.\u00a0Article 15(2) provides citizens with the right to access to places such as hotels, shops and so on but nowhere does it mention public temples.\nSome of those who oppose women entry argue that their actions are protected by Article 25(1).\nArticle 25(2) pertains to only secular aspects and it is only pertaining to social issues, not gender or religious-based issues.\nCan the state/court determine the validity of religious claims?\nThese issues highlight the tension between religious tradition and the reformist impulse of the Constitution.\nOver the years, courts have intervened in religious matters backed by Article 25(2) of the constitution.\nThe courts have put in place what is known as the \u201cessential practices\u201d test, used to decide a variety of cases. The court has used this test to decide which religious practices are eligible for constitutional protection. And to judge the extent of independence that can be enjoyed by religious denominations.\nThis test, developed by the Supreme Court in the 1950s and 60, has been criticized as allowing secular courts to determine the validity of religious claims.\nSome Important Supreme Court Important Judgments on the Essense of Religion\nIn the Ananda Marga case (2004), the Supreme Court held that the public performance of the Tandava dance was not an essential part of the religion of the Ananda Marga sect, even though it had been specifically set down as such in their holy book.\nIn Shirur Mutt case, the Supreme Court observed that a \u201creligious denomination or organization enjoys complete autonomy in the matter of deciding as to what rites and ceremonies are essential and no outside authority has any jurisdiction to interfere with their decision\u201d. At the same time, the court also said that the state can legitimately regulate religious practices when they \u201crun counter to public order, health and morality\u201d and when they are \u201ceconomic, commercial or political in their character though they are associated with religious practices\u201d.\nProtests after Sabarimala Verdict of the Supreme Court\n\n[click_to_tweet tweet=\u201dChief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, has been facing a tough time tackling the highly emotive religious issue which has also acquired political overtones.\u201d quote=\u201dChief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, has been facing a tough time tackling the highly emotive religious issue which has also acquired political overtones.\u201d]\n\nThe dialectical materialism propounded by the Marxist-led Government of Kerala doesn\u2019t seem to cut the ice with the die-hard spiritualism of the women devotees, or at least a sizable chunk of them. Many started campaigns like \u2018Ready to wait\u2018.\n\nThe SC verdict led to protests on 17 October 2018 when the temple was opened for the first time since the Supreme Court verdict came.\n\nEven though some women of menstruating age tried to enter the temple they were sent back by Police after the protests turned violent.\n\nMany women journalists were assaulted by the protestors and Police had to resort to lathi-charge to disperse them.\n\nSabarimala Karma Samithi, a relatively obscure organisation called for a state-wide Harthal. BJP-led NDA Kerala Unit and Shiv Sena Kerala Unit supported the Harthal.\n\nPandalam Palace directed the temple high priest (Tantri) to close the sanctum if any young women enter temple premises. The Tanri concurs with this view.\n\nKerala government must quickly find the golden mean between law and belief.\n\nViews of Leaders and Parties on the Issue\n\nStern action will be taken against anyone who prevents devotees from going to Sabarimala. We will go by what the Supreme Court says \u2013 Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan (CPM)\n\nThe LDF Government and Travancore Devasom Board (TDB) should seek a review petition against the Sabarimala verdict. It now seems that the verdict was based on wrong arguments and divergent views taken by the LDF Government and TDB before the Supreme Court. I concur to the views that rationality shouldn\u2019t overtopple faith. \u2013 Ramesh Chennithala, Leader of Opposition (Congress)\n\nActivists should not come to prove a point \u2013\u00a0Kerala Devaswom Board minister Kadakampally Surendran (CPM)\n\n\u201cWe were helpless. The head priest said that he will close the temple and that would have been a ritualistic disaster. We could have removed the protesters but the state government had ordered us not to. We will continue to provide security to devotees\u201d \u2013 Sreejith, Kerala Police IG\n\nUpdate (02-01-2019) \u2013 \u201cTwo women, in their forties, entered Sabarimala and performed darshan\u201d, confirms Kerala Chief Minister Pinaarayi Vijayan\n\nCreating history, two women \u2013 Bindu (42) and Kanakadurga (44) \u2013 dressed in black attire entered Sabarimala early morning on 02-01-2019. They reached Sannidhanam under the protection of police officers, a few of them in mufti.\n\nIn summary:\n\nThe recent issues of restriction on entry of women in places of worship like Sabarimala, Shani Shingnapur, and Haji Ali have once again brought the focus on the debate \u2018religious tradition versus gender equality\u2019.\n\nExcluding women from access to the shrine is a clear violation of their fundamental rights to equality (Article 14), non-discrimination (Article 15), and freedom of religion (Article 25).\n\nThe main issue is not an entry, but equality. The religious exclusion has a public character, and that it is not just an issue of a sacred tradition but one of the civil rights and material and symbolic equality.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the courts have become the arbiter of what constitutes true religion. This situation has arisen because the Indian state is the agent for the reform and management of Hinduism and its institutions.\n\nBeliefs and customs of devotees cannot be changed through a judicial process. The reforms should come from within the society. So long as that does not happen, we are likely to see religious issues being repeatedly taken to court."

The CAA does not affect any Indian citizens, including Muslim citizens.\n\nWho does the CAA apply to?\n\nIt is relevant only for Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi, and Christian foreigners, who have migrated from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan into India up to 31.12.2014, on account of persecution faced by them due to their religion. It does not apply to any other foreigners, including Muslims migrating to India from any country, including these three countries.\n\nHow does it benefit Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi, and Christian foreigners hailing from these three countries?\n\nIf their travel documents like passport and visa are not in order or are not available, they can apply for Indian citizenship if they were persecuted back home. The CAA creates this legal right for such migrants. Secondly, they get a faster route to Indian citizenship through the Naturalisation Mode. The minimum residency requirement in India would be only 1+5 years instead of 1+11 years as applicable for all other categories of foreigners.\n\nDoes this mean that Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan can never get Indian citizenship?\n\nNo, the present legal process of acquiring Indian citizenship by any foreigner of any category through Naturalization (Section 6 of the Citizenship Act) or through Registration (Section 5 of the Act) stays operational. The CAA does not amend or alter it in any manner whatsoever. Hundreds of Muslims migrating from these three countries have been granted Indian citizenship during the last few years. If found eligible, all such future migrants shall also get Indian citizenship, irrespective of their numbers or religion.\n\nIn 2014, after the settlement of Indo-Bangladesh boundary issues, 14,864 Bangladeshi citizens were given Indian Citizenship when their enclaves were incorporated into the territory of India. Thousands of these foreigners were Muslims.\n\nWill illegal Muslim immigrants from these three countries be deported under the CAA?\n\nNo, the CAA has absolutely nothing to do with the deportation of any foreigner from India. The deportation process of any foreigner irrespective of his religion or country is implemented as per the mandate of the Foreigners Act, 1946, and/or The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920. These two laws govern entry, movement within India, and exit from India of all foreigners irrespective of their religion or country.\n\nTherefore, the usual deportation process would apply to any illegal foreigner staying in India. It is a well-considered judicial process that is based on a proper inquiry by the local police or administrative authorities to detect an illegal foreigner. It is ensured that such an illegal foreigner has been issued a proper travel document by the embassy of his country so that he can be duly received by officials of his country when he is deported.\n\nIn Assam, the process of deportation happens only after the determination of such a person as a \u201cforeigner\u201d under The Foreigners Act, of 1946. Then he becomes liable for deportation. Therefore, there is nothing automatic, mechanical or discriminatory in this\nexercise. The state governments and their district-level authorities enjoy the power of Central Govt. under Section 3 of the Foreigners Act and Section 5 of The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 to detect, detain & deport any illegal foreigner.\n\nCan Hindus facing persecution on grounds of religion in countries other than these 3 countries apply under the CAA?\n\nNo, they will have to apply through the usual process to get Indian Citizenship just like any other foreigner for either registration or naturalization as a citizen of India. They would get no preference under The Citizenship Act, of 1955, even after the CAA.\n\nDoes the CAA also cover other forms of persecution \u2013 on grounds of race, gender, membership of a political or social group, language, ethnicity, etc.?\n\nNo, the CAA is a very focused law that deals specifically with foreigners of six minority community groups hailing from three neighboring countries that have their distinct state religions. Any foreigner persecuted abroad on any account may apply for registration or naturalization as a citizen of India like any other foreigner if he fulfills the minimum qualifications laid down in The Citizenship Act, of 1955.\n\nThe CAA will gradually exclude Indian Muslims from the citizenship of India.\n\nThe CAA does not apply to any Indian citizen at all. All Indian citizens enjoy the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India. CAA is not meant to deprive any Indian citizen of his citizenship. Rather it is a special law to enable certain foreigners facing a particular situation in three neighbouring countries to get Indian citizenship.\n\nCAA will be followed by NRC and all migrants except Muslims will be given citizenship and Muslims will be sent to detention camps.\n\nThe CAA has nothing to do with NRC. The legal provisions regarding NRC have been part of The Citizenship Act, 1955 since December 2004. Also, there are specific statutory rules of 2003 to operationalize these legal provisions. They govern the process of registration of Indian citizens and the issuance of national identity cards to them. These legal provisions have been on the statute books for the last 15-16 years. The CAA has not altered them in any way whatsoever.\n\nWhat are the rules for citizenship under CAA?\n\nAppropriate rules under the CAA are being framed. They will operationalize various provisions of the CAA.\n\nCAA \u2013 Myths and Facts in Perspective of North-East (Government\u2019s Release)\n\nThe government of India has also released MythBusters in connection with CAA and North-East India.\n\nCitizenship Amendment Act 2019: What is your opinion about CAA?\n\nDo you agree with the logic of the Central government behind CAA and NRC?\n\nAs a UPSC aspirant, or a citizen of India, what is your opinion about the new amendments made to the Indian Citizenship Act of 1955?\n\nShould refugees and illegal migrants be treated equally?\n\nWhat should be India\u2019s refugee policy?\n\nShould there be a nationwide NRC, as announced by the Central Government of India? Considering the cost incurred in Assam (the first state where it was conducted), will it drain the financial and human resources of this country? Is the whole exercise of CAA and NRC necessary?\n\nAre CAA and NRC diversion tactics by the government to take attention from the real problems of the country like economic slow-down, unemployment, and price-rise \u2013 as pointed out by many?\n\nWe at ClearIAS.com believe in diverse viewpoints and democratic debates. For that, you need the right information. With this information, you should analyze both sides of an issue \u2013 without any bias. Once that is done, you will be able to take a stand.\n\nIn the case of CAB, we have already presented both sides in one of our previous articles.\n\nPost your opinion and analysis as comments.\n\nRecent developments\n\n2024: The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on March 11 notified the Citizenship Amendment Rules, 2024\u00a0that would enable the\u00a0implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)\u00a0passed by the Parliament in 2019.\n\nThough the legislation facilitates citizenship to undocumented people belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Parsi, Christian, and Jain communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan, the rules state that the applicants will have to provide six types of documents and specify \u201cdate of entry\u201d in India.\nThe list of permissible documents includes birth certificates, tenancy records, identity papers, and any license, school, or educational certificate issued by a government authority in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.\nThe applicants will have to produce an \u201celigibility certificate\u201d issued by a \u201clocally reputed community institution\u201d confirming that he/she belongs to the \u201cHindu/ Sikh/ Buddhist/ Jain/ Parsi/ Christian community and continues to be a member of the above-mentioned community.\u201d"

            "[CONTENT]": "What is Citizenship Amendment Bill or CAB? Why is it controversial? Read further to know more.\n\nThe Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) is a bill introduced by the Central Government in the Parliament of India in 2019 to primarily amend the Citizenship Act of 1955.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPurpose of the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) 2019\nWhat makes the Citizenship Amendment Bill Controversial?\nThe Stand of the Government regarding CAB\nThree flaws in the logic of the Central Government\nCitizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) vs National Register for Citizens (NRC)\nThe NRC in Assam\nActs which the CAB amend:\nOverseas Citizen of India (OCI) and CAB\nConcerns of the North East Region of India\nExceptions to the Bill\nStatus of the Citizenship Amendment Bill\nConclusion\nPurpose of the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) 2019\n\nThe main purpose of the bill is to make certain religious communities of illegal migrants or refugees eligible for Indian citizenship \u2013 in a fast-track manner.\n\nThe Bill, among other things, seeks to grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Buddhists and Christians who migrated to India till the end of 2014 from countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, due to reasons like persecutions.\n\nWhat makes the Citizenship Amendment Bill Controversial?\n\nThe Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2019, in effect, seeks to give Indian nationality only to the non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.\nSix religious communities \u2013 Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians \u2013 are considered eligible for Indian citizenship if they entered India on or before 31 December 2014, but not Muslims.\nThe countries from which minorities are allowed include Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, but not Myanmar or Sri Lanka.\nCitizenship is granted by relaxing the requirement of residence in India for citizenship by naturalisation from 11 years to 5 years for these migrants.\nNorth-east India has already suffered a lot due to the problem of illegal migrants. The natives of North-east India are against any move to allow citizenship to illegal migrants \u2013 irrespective of their religion.\nThe Stand of the Government regarding CAB\n\nThe Central government is of the opinion that the bill is not discriminatory against Muslims. As the Citizenship Amendment Bill has not amended the original provisions,\u00a0any foreigner, including a Muslim, can still apply for Indian citizenship under the normal process of naturalisation. However, it may take 11 or more years to get Citizenship in this route.\n\nThe strong advocate of the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) 2019, Amit Shah, Home Minister of India, connected the 2-nation theory which led to the division of India with the new bill. As per him, as the two nations \u2013 India and Pakistan \u2013 are created on the basis of religion, CAB turned a necessity now.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHome Minister also cited the Nehru-Liaquat pact. As per him, Nehru-Liaquat pact failed to achieve its objectives in protecting minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan have declared Islam as their State Religion. However, there are religious persecutions of minorities in these countries. Home Minister pointed out the declining minority population in the three neighbouring countries.\n\nThe CAB legislation, as per the Union Government, will give bring a new light into the lives of the people who were facing religious persecution in neighbouring countries.\n\nAs per the government, the bill does not violate any provisions of the Constitution including Article 14.\n\nNote: You can read more about the Government\u2019s clarification on CAA here.\n\nThree flaws in the logic of the Central Government\nEven though Jinnah proposed 2-nation theory in the 1940s, the result was never a Muslim Pakistan and a Hindu India. While one nation (Pakistan) was created on the basis of religion, the other nation was created on the basis of secular ideology (India). In secular India, citizenship was granted to members of all regions including Islam.\nOnly Pakistan and Bangladesh were part of Pre-Partition India, Afganistan was not. Even if the government take moral responsibility to protect the minorities affected by the 2-nation theory, that logic is not applicable in the case of Afganistan.\nIf the intention of the CAB is to protect all minorities facing persecution in the neighbouring countries- the bill turns a blind eye on the minorities in Myanmar (Rohingya Muslims) and Sri Lanka (Tamils).\n\nThus clearly, the bill is highly selective. CAB is intended to select some communities and omit others.\n\nCitizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) vs National Register for Citizens (NRC)\n\nThe Centre has been trying to implement both the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). There are protests regarding the implementation of both.\n\nLet us see what are the differences between CAB and NRC.\n\nWhile the CAB is a bill, NRC is a digital register.\nNRC is not based on religion, while CAB is.\nThe base-year of NRC is 1971 (in the case of Assam), while the base-year of CAB is 2014.\n\nNRC is a verified digital register having names and basic demographic information about\u00a0all Indian citizens in a digital format.\n\nThe names of all persons born in India or having Indian parentage or having resided in India for at least 11 years, will be mentioned as Indian Citizens in the National Register for Citizens (NRC).\n\nThe NRC in Assam\n\nThe process of NRC started at first in the state of Assam. The National Register of Citizens or NRC in Assam targeted illegal immigrants. A person had to prove that either they or their ancestors were in Assam on or before March 24, 1971.\n\nA total of 3.3 crore people who had applied for inclusion in the document. However, the final version of the NRC (as on August 31) contained the names of only 3.11 crore people. About 19 lakh people were not included in the NRC. The people who failed to prove citizenship were not only Muslims but also Hindus.\n\nNot all omitted from NRC in Assam were illegal migrants from Bangladesh, but migrants from neighbouring states. Union Government plans to extend NRC to the rest of India soon \u2013 in a move to seek more clarity on the same.\n\nHowever, the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 may help non-Muslims in Assam left out of the NRC to get the citizenship of India \u2013 without further hurdles. The bill is silent about Muslims.\n\nActs which the CAB amend:\nCitizenship Act of 1955.\nPassport Act of 1920.\nForeigners Act of 1946.\nOverseas Citizen of India (OCI) and CAB\n\nThe Bill also proposes to incorporate a sub-section (d) to Section 7, providing for cancellation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration where the OCI card-holder has violated any provision of the Citizenship Act or any other law in force.\n\nConcerns of the North East Region of India\n\nNortheast people are immensely worried about the possible demographic changes the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill could cause in the region. The Northeast region has long battled migration from Bangladesh.\n\nThe natives of North-east are fiercely opposed to any \u2018outsider\u2019 settling in. Protests have already broken out over the fears that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill could end up destroying the culture and ethnicity of the region.\n\nExceptions to the Bill\nCAB won\u2019t apply to areas under the sixth schedule of the Indian Constitution \u2013 which deals with autonomous tribal-dominated regions in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.\nThe bill will also not apply to states that have the inner-line permit regime (Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram).\nStatus of the Citizenship Amendment Bill\n\nThe Union Cabinet cleared the Bill on 4 December 2019. It was passed by the Lok Sabha on 10 December and Rajya Sabha on 11 December.\n\nIn Lok Sabha, the\u00a0 Bill was passed 311-80, with zero abstentions after the Opposition put up a spirited attack against it.\n\nIn Rajya Sabha, 125 votes were cast in favour and 105 against the bill.\n\nThe President of India signed the bill on December 12, and the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) became the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).\n\nHowever, the CAA is not effective yet. It is to be notified by the government on a date chosen by it.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe chief opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill is that it discriminates on the basis of religion by identifying only non-Muslims refugees as those who would be eligible for Indian citizenship.\n\nWhile any foreigner can still apply for Indian citizenship, he/she has to follow the normal process of naturalisation \u2013 which takes 11 or more years.\n\nThe CAB is seen by many as a quick move to change the demographics and voters-profile in favour of the ruling party by selective admission of illegal migrants.\n\nAs per the critics, Citizenship (Amendment) Bill violates Article 14 of the Indian Constitution \u2013 the fundamental right which guarantees equality to all persons. This is part of the basic structure of the Constitution and hence cannot be reshaped by any Parliament laws.\n\nIt is yet to be seen if the Supreme Court allows the selective fast-tracking for Indian Citizenship. The apex court has power even to declare the bill as unconstitutional.\n\nThe policy towards illegal migrants and refugees needs wider debates and deliberation. However, religion can never be the basis of Indian Citizenship."

This will be a chip-embedded smart card with the UID number (Aadhaar) printed.\n\nIn India, NPR was prepared along with the Census 2011. It was updated in 2015.\n\nThe new and latest NPR is planned to be conducted across India (except Assam) between April 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020, along with the next census enumeration.\n\nNPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive; it would also include a foreigner staying in an area for more than six months.\n\nNPR is the prelude to the NRC.\n\nNational Register of Citizens (NRC)\n\nNRC is a verified digital register having names and basic demographic information about all Indian citizens in a digital format.\n\nA person born in India or having Indian parentage or having resided in India for at least 11 years, is eligible for Indian citizenship.\n\nUnion Government has recently announced that NRC will be implemented across all states in India.\n\nThe register was first prepared after the 1951 Census of India and since then it has not been updated until recently. The northeast Indian state of Assam has become the first state in India where the updating of the NRC is being taken up.\n\nNRC would be India\u2019s first such database of citizens.\n\nWhile NPR will include details of foreigners who are residing in India for a period of 6 months or more, NRC will contain details of only the citizens of India. Hence, NRC can be said to be a subset of the National Population Register (NPR).\n\nAadhar (UID)\n\nAadhaar is a verifiable 12-digit identification number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to the residents of India free of cost.\n\nThe Aadhaar number on its own does NOT provide citizenship. It is just a unique number based on your biometric data.\n\nIt is compulsory for all Indian residents to register with the NPR, while registration with the UIDAI is considered voluntary.\n\nAadhar equips the holder to avail of certain services offered by the government. If the resident wishes to avail those services, he should register for the Aadhar. Otherwise, he can opt out of Aadhaar.\n\nCitizenship Amendment Bill (CAB)\n\nThe Citizenship Amendment bill seeks to amend the Citizenship Act, of 1955, and grant citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who have illegally migrated into India.\n\nThe Bill also seeks to reduce the requirement of 11 years of continuous stay in the country to six years to obtain citizenship by naturalization.\n\nSome opposition parties have maintained that the move violates Article 14 of the Constitution through religious discrimination, as illegal migrants of the Muslim community are not given citizenship status. The Act doesn\u2019t have a provision for Muslim sects like Shias and Ahmediyas who also face persecution in Pakistan.\n\nThe Union Government is planning to introduce the Citizenship Amendment bill before implementing the National Register of Citizens.\n\nThe Citizenship Amendment Bill received a lot of opposition from the natives of the state of Assam \u2013 where there are a lot of illegal immigrants. The tribes of Assam are not against any community but are against illegal immigration altogether. However, in Assam, the NRC is already implemented. If the bill becomes an Act, the NRC of the state of Assam may also get challenged.\n\nCensus vs NPR\n\nThe recent exercise of NPR is connected with Census 2021, however, there are differences between the two.\n\nThe census is a macro exercise where the data is protected by the confidentiality clause. The census is not intended to identify the individual identity details, while the NPR, on the other hand, is designed to collect the identity details of every individual.\n\nThe 2021 census will conclude on March 1 at midnight. A revisional round will be conducted between March 1, 2021, and March 5, 2021, to include who is left from the exercise.\n\nPoints to note regarding NPR, NRC, and Aadhaar:\nNational Population Register (NPR) may help the government solve many issues in the country. The government decided to update the National Population Register along with the House listing phase of Census 2021 from April to September 2020 in all the States/UTs except Assam.\nWhile registering with the NPR is mandatory, furnishing of additional data such as PAN, Aadhaar, driving license, and voter ID is voluntary.\nNPR will seek verification of biometric details from UIDAI. Hence, those holding Aadhaar are not required to give biometric details to NPR.\nThe 15 demographic parameters that will be included in NPR are: (1) Name of person (2) Relationship to head of household (3) Father\u2019s name (4) Mother\u2019s name (4) Spouse\u2019s name (if married) (5) Sex (6) Date of Birth (7) Marital status (8) Place of birth (9) Nationality (as declared) (10) Present address of usual residence (11) Duration of stay at present address (12) Permanent (13) residential address (14) Occupation/Activity (15) Educational qualification\nNPR will be the base for a nationwide National Register of Citizens. You may note that the list of citizens of Assam was released recently.\nThe main purpose of the NPR is to identify illegal migrants and identify them as foreign nationals. However, you may note that \u2013 NPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive. NPR will also include a foreigner staying in an area for more than six months.\nThe Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is responsible for enrolling individuals in the UID scheme, and the Registrar General of India (RGI) is responsible for enrolling individuals in the NPR scheme.\nThe main aim of Aadhar is to identify the beneficiaries of government services like subsidies.\nThere is a great overlap between the data collected for Aadhar and NPR \u2013 hence efforts are made for more synergy.\nNRC can be considered as a subset of the National Population Register (NPR).\nUPSC Question from the topic: Aadhaar vs. NPR\n\nCSE Main Exam 2014) Two parallel run schemes of the Government, viz the Adhar card and NPR, one voluntary and the other compulsory, have led to debates at national levels and also litigations. On merits, discuss whether or not both schemes need to run concurrently. Analyze the potential of the schemes to achieve development benefits and equitable growth.\n\nWhy is this topic important?\n\nUnion Home Minister, Amit Shah had told the Rajya Sabha that the National Registry of Citizens (NRC) will be implemented throughout the country (November 20, 2019)."

According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), just over 60% of the population in India has access to essential healthcare services. This is lower than the global average of 72%. In addition, there are significant disparities in access to healthcare within India, with rural areas often lacking the same level of access as urban areas.\nPoor health infrastructure: A related issue is the limited availability of quality health infrastructure in India. Many parts of the country lack sufficient hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities, making it difficult for people to access care when they need it. In addition, many of the healthcare facilities that do exist are often underfunded and understaffed, leading to suboptimal care.\nShortage of healthcare professionals: India also faces a shortage of healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas. According to data from the WHO, there are just over three doctors per 10,000 people in India, which is lower than the global average of over six doctors per 10,000 people. This shortage of healthcare professionals makes it difficult for many people to access the care they need.\nHigh out-of-pocket healthcare costs: Another issue facing India is the high cost of healthcare, particularly for those who pay out-of-pocket. According to data from the WHO, out-of-pocket healthcare expenses account for around 60% of total healthcare expenditure in India. This can be a significant burden for many families, particularly those living in poverty.\nPoor quality of care: In addition to the issues of access and affordability, the quality of healthcare in India can also be a concern. Many healthcare facilities lack the necessary equipment and supplies to provide high-quality care, and there can be significant variations in the quality of care provided by different facilities.\n\nIndia faces several issues related to the health of its citizens. While there has been some progress in recent years, addressing these issues will require significant investment in healthcare infrastructure, efforts to increase the availability of healthcare professionals, and policies to improve the affordability and quality of care.\n\nIndia\u2019s issues with tackling the menace of Anit Microbial Resistance\n\nIndia faces some issues related to the health of its citizens. While there has been some progress in recent years, addressing these issues will require significant investment in healthcare infrastructure, efforts to increase the availability of healthcare professionals, and policies to improve the affordability and quality of care.\n\nAnti-microbial resistance (AMR) is a growing problem in India, with significant implications for public health. AMR occurs when microorganisms, such as bacteria, develop the ability to resist the effects of drugs, making it more difficult to treat infections. Here are some key points on the issues of AMR in India:\n\nHigh rates of AMR: India has some of the highest rates of AMR in the world. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the rate of AMR in India is significantly higher than the global average. This is particularly concerning for diseases such as tuberculosis, which is a major public health problem in India.\nOveruse of antibiotics: One of the main drivers of AMR in India is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. According to data from the WHO, the use of antibiotics in India is among the highest in the world, with many people misusing them or without a prescription. This contributes to the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\nPoor regulation of antibiotics: Another contributing factor to AMR in India is the lack of regulation of antibiotics. In India, antibiotics are often available without a prescription, making it easy for people to obtain them. In addition, there is often a lack of oversight in the production and distribution of antibiotics, leading to the proliferation of fake or substandard drugs.\nLimited surveillance: A further issue is the limited surveillance of AMR in India. While the country has made some progress in recent years in improving surveillance, there is still a lack of data on the extent of AMR and its impact on public health.\nImplications for public health: AMR has significant implications for public health in India. It makes it more difficult to treat infections, leading to higher morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, AMR has the potential to undermine progress made in the treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis, which is a major public health problem in India.\n\nAMR is a growing problem in India, with significant implications for public health. Tackling AMR will require efforts to reduce the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, improve the regulation of antibiotics, and increase surveillance of AMR.\n\nDisease Burden of India\nNon-communicable diseases: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are a major burden in India. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), NCDs account for more than 70% of all deaths in India. The leading causes of NCD-related deaths in India are cardiovascular diseases, followed by cancer and diabetes.\nInfectious diseases: Infectious diseases are also a significant burden in India. According to data from the WHO, the leading causes of infectious disease-related deaths in India are lower respiratory infections, followed by diarrheal diseases and HIV/AIDS.\nMalnutrition: Malnutrition is a major public health problem in India, with a large portion of the population suffering from malnutrition. According to data from the WHO, 38% of children under the age of five in India are stunted (too short for their age), which is a sign of chronic malnutrition. In addition, 20% of children under the age of five are underweight, and 21% are wasted (too thin for their height).\nTuberculosis: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in India. According to data from the WHO, India has the highest burden of TB in the world, with 2.7 million cases reported in 2020. TB is the leading cause of infectious disease-related deaths in India, accounting for over 400,000 deaths in 2020.\nMental health: Mental health is also a significant burden in India. According to data from the WHO, the prevalence of mental health disorders in India is around 10%, with common disorders including depression and anxiety. However, the availability of mental health services in India is limited, with just 0.06% of the total healthcare budget allocated to mental health.\n\nIndia faces a significant burden of disease, with NCDs, infectious diseases, malnutrition, TB, and mental health all major public health challenges. Addressing these diseases will require significant efforts to improve public health infrastructure, increase access to quality healthcare, and address the underlying social and economic determinants of health.\n\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nIn recent years, the government of India has implemented many initiatives to develop the health sector in the country. Here are some key points on these initiatives:\n\nNational Health Policy: In 2017, the government of India released the National Health Policy (NHP), which outlines the country\u2019s vision for the health sector. The NHP aims to ensure universal access to quality healthcare, with a particular focus on addressing the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable populations. The NHP also emphasizes the importance of preventative healthcare and the need to strengthen the healthcare system.\nAyushman Bharat: Ayushman Bharat is a flagship healthcare program of the government of India, launched in 2018.

The program also includes initiatives to improve the availability of healthcare professionals and to strengthen the healthcare system.\nNational Health Mission: The National Health Mission (NHM) is a program launched by the government of India in 2013 to improve the availability and accessibility of quality healthcare in the country. The NHM includes a range of initiatives, including the upgrading of health facilities, the training of healthcare professionals, and the expansion of vaccination programs.\nJan Aushadhi Scheme: The Jan Aushadhi Scheme is a program launched by the government of India in 2015 to provide affordable medicine to the population. Under the scheme, generic drugs are made available at a discounted price through a network of Jan Aushadhi stores. The scheme aims to make essential medicines more affordable and accessible to the population.\nNational Mental Health Programme: The National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) is a program launched by the government of India in 1982 to address the burden of mental health disorders in the country. The NMHP includes initiatives to improve the availability of mental health services, to increase awareness about mental health, and to provide training for healthcare professionals.\n\nThe government of India has implemented a range of initiatives to develop the health sector in the country. These initiatives aim to improve the availability and accessibility of quality healthcare, with a focus on disadvantaged and vulnerable populations.\n\nWhat are the steps to ensure good health outcomes in India?\n\nEnsuring good health outcomes in India is a major challenge, given the country\u2019s large and diverse population. However, several measures can be taken to improve health outcomes in the country. Here are some key points on measures to ensure good health outcomes in India:\n\nUniversal health coverage: One of the key measures to ensure good health outcomes in India is the implementation of universal health coverage (UHC). UHC refers to the provision of essential healthcare services to all people, regardless of their ability to pay. By providing access to quality healthcare to all members of the population, UHC can help to reduce morbidity and mortality rates and improve overall health outcomes.\nStrengthening the healthcare system: Another measure to improve health outcomes in India is to strengthen the healthcare system. This can include efforts to improve the availability of healthcare professionals, upgrade and expand healthcare facilities, and increase the availability of essential medicines.\nPromoting preventative healthcare: Promoting preventative healthcare measures is another important step to ensure good health outcomes in India. This can include initiatives to increase vaccination rates, improve hygiene and sanitation, and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors such as exercise and a healthy diet.\nAddressing social and economic determinants of health: Another important measure to improve health outcomes in India is to address the social and economic determinants of health. This can include efforts to reduce poverty, improve education, and address issues such as gender inequality and discrimination.\nImproving data collection and surveillance: Improving data collection and surveillance is another measure that can help to ensure good health outcomes in India. By collecting and analyzing data on health outcomes and trends, it is possible to identify areas of need and develop targeted interventions to address them.\n\nSeveral measures can be taken to ensure good health outcomes in India. These measures include the implementation of universal health coverage, the strengthening of the healthcare system, the promotion of preventative healthcare, the addressing of social and economic determinants of health, and the improvement of data collection and surveillance.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation is a key factor in the development of any country, and India is no exception. However, the education sector in India faces several issues, which can have significant implications for the development of the country. Here are some key points on the issues facing the educational sector in India:\n\nAccess to education: One of the major issues facing the education sector in India is the limited access to education for many people, particularly those living in rural and disadvantaged areas. According to data from the World Bank, the enrollment rate in primary education in India is around 95%, but this varies significantly by region, with some areas having much lower enrollment rates. In addition, there are significant disparities in enrollment rates between boys and girls, with girls often having lower enrollment rates.\nQuality of education: Another issue facing the education sector in India is the quality of education. According to data from the World Bank, the quality of education in India is generally low, with many students not achieving basic competencies in subjects such as reading, writing, and math. This can have significant implications for the development of the country, as a poorly educated workforce can hinder economic growth.\nTeacher shortages: A further issue facing the education sector in India is the shortage of teachers. According to data from the World Bank, there is a shortage of around 1.5 million teachers in India, particularly in rural areas. This can lead to overcrowded classrooms and a lack of individual attention for students, which can affect the quality of education.\nLack of resources: Another issue facing the education sector in India is the lack of resources, including funding, materials, and infrastructure. Many schools in India lack basic facilities such as electricity, clean water, and toilets, which can make it difficult for students to learn effectively. In addition, there may be a lack of funding for education, which can lead to inadequate resources and facilities.\nInequalities: A final issue facing the education sector in India is the existence of significant inequalities. There are significant disparities in the quality of education between different regions and socio-economic groups, with disadvantaged groups often having lower access to education and poorer quality education. This can perpetuate existing inequalities and hinder the development of the country.\nStatus of Literacy Rates in India\n\nLiteracy is an important indicator of the development of a country, as it reflects the ability of the population to read and write, and to access information. In India, the literacy rate has improved significantly in recent years, but there are still significant disparities within the country. Here are some key points on the status of literacy in India:\n\nOverall literacy rate: According to data from the World Bank, the overall literacy rate in India is around 74%. This represents a significant improvement from the literacy rate of just over 60% in the early 1990s. However, the literacy rate varies significantly by region and socio-economic group, with some groups having much lower literacy rates.\nGender disparities: There are also significant gender disparities in literacy in India. According to data from the World Bank, the literacy rate for males in India is around 82%, while the literacy rate for females is around 65%. This gap in literacy rates between males and females has been decreasing over time, but it remains a significant issue.\nRural-urban disparities: Another issue is the disparities in literacy rates between rural and urban areas. According to data from the World Bank, the literacy rate in urban areas in India is around 85%, while the literacy rate in rural areas is around 69%. This gap in literacy rates between urban and rural areas has also been decreasing over time, but it remains a significant issue.\nDisparities by socio-economic group: There are also significant disparities in literacy rates between different socio-economic groups in India. According to data from the World Bank, the literacy rate for the highest socio-economic quintile (top 20% of the population) in India is around 91%, while the literacy rate for the lowest socio-economic quintile (bottom 20% of the population) is around 49%. This gap in literacy rates between different socio-economic groups has also been decreasing over time, but it remains a significant issue.\nEfforts to improve literacy: The government of India has implemented some initiatives to improve literacy in the country. These include the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, a program launched in 2001 to universalize access to education, and the National Literacy Mission, a program launched in 1988 to promote literacy and adult education.\n\nWhile the literacy rate in India has improved significantly in recent years, there are still significant disparities within the country, particularly concerning gender, location, and socio-economic status. Efforts to improve literacy, such as those undertaken by the government of India, are important in addressing these disparities and in promoting the development\n\nVarious reports on the Education sector in India\n\nHere are the details of a few reports published before the government by various committees\n\nASER Report\n\nThe Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) is an annual survey of education in India, conducted by the non-profit organization Pratham. The ASER report provides detailed data on the status of education in India, including enrollment rates, attendance rates, and the quality of education. Here are some key points in the ASER report on education in India:\n\nEnrollment rates: According to the ASER report, the enrollment rate in primary education in India is around 95%. However, the enrollment rate varies significantly by region and socio-economic group, with some groups having much lower enrollment rates. For example, the enrollment rate for the lowest socio-economic quintile (bottom 20% of the population) is around 85%, while the enrollment rate for the highest socio-economic quintile (top 20% of the population) is around 99%.\nAttendance rates: The ASER report also provides data on attendance rates in primary education in India. According to the report, the attendance rate for primary education is around 95%. However, the attendance rate varies significantly by region and socio-economic group, with some groups having much lower attendance rates. For example, the attendance rate for the lowest socio-economic quintile is around 90%, while the attendance rate for the highest socio-economic quintile is around 98%.\nQuality of education: The ASER report also provides data on the quality of education in India. According to the report, the quality of education in India is generally low, with many students not achieving basic competencies in subjects such as reading, writing, and math. The quality of education varies significantly by region and socio-economic group, with some groups having much lower levels of learning.\nTeacher shortages: The ASER report also highlights the issue of teacher shortages in India. According to the report, many schools in India have a shortage of teachers, particularly in rural areas. This can lead to overcrowded classrooms and a lack of individual attention for students, which can affect the quality of education.\nOther issues: The ASER report also highlights other issues facing the education sector in India, including the lack of resources, such as funding, materials, and infrastructure, and the existence of significant inequalities in the quality of education between different regions and socio-economic groups.\n\nThe Subramaniam Panel report\n\nSubramaniam Panel is a committee set up by the government of India to review the education sector in the country and to make recommendations for reform. The panel released its report in 2017, outlining a range of recommendations for improving the education sector in India. Here are some key points on the Subramaniam Panel report on education in India:\n\nIncreased funding: One of the main recommendations of the Subramaniam Panel report is the need for increased funding for the education sector. The report recommends that the government of India increase its spending on education to 6% of gross domestic product (GDP), up from the current level of around 4%. This increased funding would be used to improve the quality and accessibility of education, particularly for disadvantaged and marginalized groups.\nQuality of education: The Subramaniam Panel report also emphasizes the need to improve the quality of education in India. The report recommends a range of measures to improve the quality of education, including the training and professional development of teachers, the use of technology to enhance learning, and the provision of quality infrastructure and materials.\nEquity: Another key recommendation of the Subramaniam Panel report is the need to address equity in education. The report highlights the significant disparities in the quality of education between different regions and socio-economic groups and recommends measures to address these inequalities, such as targeted funding and interventions for disadvantaged groups.\nTeachers: The Subramaniam Panel report also highlights the importance of teachers in improving the education sector in India.

The scheme aims to promote access to education for minorities.\nRashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan: The Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan is a program launched by the government to promote research and innovation among school students. The program aims to create a culture of curiosity and innovation among young students and encourage them to pursue careers in science and technology.\n\nThe education sector in India has seen significant development in recent years with the introduction of several schemes and initiatives by the government. From primary school to higher education, the government has focused on improving the quality of education and increasing access to education for all.\n\nThe National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 aims to revamp the education system in the country and increase the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in higher education from 26.3% in 2018 to 50% by 2035.\n\nIt is evident that the education sector in India is on the path of development and progress, and it is expected that these initiatives will help to create a more skilled and educated workforce in the country.\n\nHuman Resources\n\nHuman Resource Development (HRD) refers to the process of improving the skills, knowledge, and competencies of the workforce in an organization or country. In India, there are several issues relating to HRD that need to be addressed to ensure that the country\u2019s workforce is well-equipped to meet the demands of the 21st century.\n\nSkill gap: One of the major issues in HRD in India is the gap between the skills that are in demand in the job market and the skills that are available in the workforce. According to a report by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), only 2.3% of the Indian workforce has undergone formal skill training, while the demand for skilled workers is much higher. This skill gap is a major hindrance to the country\u2019s economic development and needs to be addressed through effective skill development programs.\nLack of quality education: Another issue in HRD in India is the lack of quality education in the country. Despite significant progress in increasing access to education, the quality of education remains a concern. According to the latest National Achievement Survey (NAS) conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), only 50% of Class VIII students in the country can solve basic division problems. This indicates a need for improvement in the quality of education being provided in the country.\nBrain drain: India has a large number of highly skilled professionals who leave the country in search of better opportunities abroad. This phenomenon, known as brain drain, is a major issue in HRD in India as it leads to a loss of valuable human resources for the country. According to data from the Ministry of External Affairs, around 1.5 million Indians are living and working abroad. This brain drain needs to be addressed through the creation of better job opportunities and a more conducive environment for professionals to work and thrive in the country.\nUnemployment: Unemployment is a major issue in HRD in India, particularly among the youth. According to the latest data from the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the unemployment rate in the country was 6.5% in December 2020. This indicates a need for job creation and training programs to help the country\u2019s youth find employment.\nGender inequality: Gender inequality is another issue in HRD in India. Despite the progress made in recent years, women in the country still face discrimination in terms of access to education and employment opportunities. According to the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Report 2021, India ranks 112th out of 156 countries in terms of gender equality. This indicates a need for policies and programs to promote gender equality and empower women in the country.\n\nIn conclusion, HRD in India faces several issues that need to be addressed to ensure that the country\u2019s workforce is equipped to meet the demands of the 21st century. These issues include the skill gap, lack of quality education, brain drain, unemployment, and gender inequality. Addressing these issues will require the implementation of effective policies and programs to improve the skills, knowledge, and competencies of the workforce in the country.\n\nGovernment Schemes relating to the development of Human Resources\n\nSkill development is an important aspect of human resource development in any country. It helps to improve the employability and productivity of the workforce and contributes to the overall economic development of the country. In India, the government has implemented several schemes and initiatives to promote skill development in the country. Some of the key government schemes related to skill development in India are:\n\nPradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY): The PMKVY is a flagship skill development program launched by the Government of India to provide training to youth and increase their employability.

The scheme provides financial assistance to establishments that hire apprentices and also provides a stipend to the apprentices during the training period. The NAPS aims to provide apprenticeship training to 50 lakh youth by 2020.\nDeen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY): The DDU-GKY is a skill development program launched by the Government of India to provide training to rural youth. The program focuses on providing employment-oriented skill training to the rural poor, particularly those belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. The DDU-GKY aims to train 50 lakh rural youth by 2020.\nSector Skill Councils (SSCs): The SSCs are industry-led organizations that aim to promote skill development in specific sectors. There are over 30 SSCs in India that focus on sectors such as automotive, construction, healthcare, and retail, among others. The SSCs work with the NSDC and other organizations to develop sector-specific skill development programs and provide certification to individuals who have undergone skill training.\n\nThe Indian government has implemented several schemes and initiatives to promote skill development in the country. These schemes aim to provide training and employment opportunities to the youth and improve the employability and productivity of the workforce. The government\u2019s focus on skill development is expected to contribute to the overall economic development of the country.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe social sector in India faces several issues relating to development that need to be addressed to ensure the well-being and development of the country\u2019s citizens. These issues include poverty, lack of access to healthcare and education, gender inequality, and discrimination against marginalized communities.\n\nDespite significant progress in recent years, these issues continue to plague the country and hinder its development. To address these issues, the government and civil society organizations need to implement effective policies and programs that focus on reducing poverty, improving access to healthcare and education, promoting gender equality, and protecting the rights of marginalized communities.\n\nOnly by addressing these issues can India hope to create a more inclusive and equitable society for all its citizens.\n\nArticle written by: Jis John Sebastian"

This can be achieved through the expansion of industries, the creation of jobs, and the development of infrastructure.\nSocial development involves improving the well-being and quality of life of a country\u2019s citizens. This can include initiatives to improve education, healthcare, and access to necessities such as clean water and sanitation.\nPolitical development refers to the process of building and strengthening democratic institutions and practices. This can include the establishment of a fair and just legal system, the protection of human rights, and the promotion of participation and representation in the political process.\n\nOther dimensions of development may include cultural, environmental, and technological development.\n\nCivil Societies\n\nCivil society is a group of individuals and organizations that operate outside of the government and the private sector and work to address issues of public concern.\n\nCivil society organizations can be involved in a wide range of activities, including social justice, environmentalism, human rights, and economic development.\nCivil society plays a vital role in democracy by providing a space for citizens to come together and address issues of concern, and by holding governments accountable for their actions.\nCivil society organizations can also serve as a bridge between the government and the broader community and can provide important resources and support to marginalized groups.\nNon-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)\n\nAn NGO (non-governmental organization) is a non-profit organization that is independent of government and is usually focused on social or political issues.\n\nNGOs can be local, national, or international, and they can focus on a wide range of issues such as human rights, the environment, education, healthcare, and economic development.\nSome NGOs receive funding from governments, foundations, or corporations, but they are not directly controlled by any of these entities.\nThey are often seen as an important part of civil society and can play a role in advocating for change and addressing social and environmental issues.\nTypes of NGOs\n\nThere are many different types of NGOs, and they can vary widely in terms of their size, scope, and focus. Some examples of different types of NGOs include:\n\nDevelopment NGOs: These organizations work to address issues related to economic and social development, such as poverty, disease, and inequality.\nHuman rights NGOs: These organizations work to promote and protect the human rights of individuals and communities around the world.\nEnvironmental NGOs: These organizations work to protect the environment and address issues related to climate change, pollution, and the conservation of natural resources.\nHealth NGOs: These organizations work to improve the health and well-being of individuals and communities through initiatives such as providing healthcare services and promoting public health.\nEducation NGOs: These organizations work to improve access to education and promote educational opportunities for disadvantaged communities.\nRelief and humanitarian NGOs: These organizations assist people affected by disasters, conflict, or other humanitarian crises.\nAdvocacy NGOs: These organizations work to influence public policy and bring about social change by raising awareness about particular issues and advocating for specific policy positions.\nCommunity-based NGOs: These organizations work at the local level to address the needs and concerns of specific communities.\n\nThere are many other types of NGOs as well, and an organization can fall into more than one category.\n\nSelf Help Groups\n\nSelf-help groups are groups of people who come together to support each other and work towards a common goal.\n\nThese groups are often formed around a particular issue or problem, and they can be an effective way for people to find support and solutions to their problems.\n\nSelf-help groups can be found for a wide range of issues, including addiction, mental health, chronic illness, and personal development.\n\nMany self-help groups in India are focused on a wide range of issues, including health, education, economic development, and social justice. Some examples of self-help groups in India include:\n\nWomen\u2019s self-help groups: These groups bring together women to support each other and work towards economic and social empowerment.\nFarmer\u2019s self-help groups: These groups bring together farmers to share knowledge and resources, and to advocate for their interests.\nYouth self-help groups: These groups bring together young people to work on issues related to education, employment, and social issues.\nDisability self-help groups: These groups bring together people with disabilities to support each other and advocate for their rights.\nMental health self-help groups: These groups bring together people with mental health challenges to provide support and resources.\n\nSelf-help groups in India are often supported by NGOs or other organizations, but they are typically run by and for the benefit of the members of the group. They can be an effective way for people to find support and solutions to the challenges they face.\n\nMicro Finance Institutions\n\nMicrofinance institutions (MFIs) are financial institutions that provide small loans and other financial services to individuals and small businesses in developing countries.\n\nMicrofinance institutions (MFIs) have played an important role in India in providing financial services to underserved populations. There are many MFIs operating in India, including both non-profit and for-profit organizations.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Indian government introduced regulatory reforms that helped to promote the growth of the microfinance industry in the country. As a result, MFIs have become an important source of credit for small businesses and low-income individuals in India.\n\nThere are several types of MFIs operating in India, including:\n\nSelf-help group-based MFIs: These organizations work with self-help groups to provide small loans and other financial services.\nMicrofinance companies: These for-profit companies provide microloans and other financial services to small businesses and low-income individuals.\nNon-profit MFIs: These organizations provide microloans and other financial services to low-income individuals and small businesses, to promote economic development and improve the well-being of disadvantaged communities.\n\nMFIs in India have faced challenges in the past, including high interest rates and issues related to over-indebtedness. However, the sector has continued to grow and has had a positive impact on the lives of many people in the country.\n\nSocieties, Trusts, Donors, Charities, and other Stakeholders\n\nSome of the laws governing societies, trusts, and other endowments in India include\n\nSocieties Registration Act 1860\nReligious Endowments Act 1863\nIndian Trust Act 1882\nCharitable Endowments Act 1863\nBombay Public Trust Act\nSocieties\n\nA society is a group of people who come together for a common purpose, such as to promote a particular cause, advance a shared interest, or provide a service to the community.\n\nSocieties can be organized around a wide range of interests, including cultural, educational, scientific, or charitable causes.\nSocieties can take many different forms, including non-profit organizations, professional associations, and voluntary organizations. They may be funded by membership fees, donations, or grants, and they may be run by a board of directors or other governing body.\nSocieties can play an important role in communities by providing resources, support, and a sense of belonging to their members. They can also be an effective way to advocate for change and raise awareness about particular issues.\nTrusts, Religious endowments, and Waqfs\n\nThey may be described as follows:\n\nTRUSTS\n\nA trust is a legal arrangement in which one person (the trustor) transfers ownership of assets to another person (the trustee) to hold and manage for the benefit of a third party (the beneficiary).\n\nTrusts are typically used to manage and protect assets, such as money, property, or investments, and they can be an effective way to ensure that the assets are used for the benefit of the beneficiary.\nThere are many different types of trusts, including revocable trusts, irrevocable trusts, living trusts, and testamentary trusts. The terms of a trust are outlined in a legal document called a trust agreement or trust instrument.\nTrusts can be used for a variety of purposes, including managing assets for children or other beneficiaries who are too young to manage them themselves, minimizing taxes, and protecting assets from creditors or lawsuits.\nTrusts can be a useful tool for estate planning and can help to ensure that assets are distributed according to the wishes of the trustor.\nRELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS\n\nReligious endowments are assets, such as land, buildings, or money, that are set aside for the support or maintenance of a religious organization or institution.\n\nThese endowments may be established by the religious organization itself, or they may be donated by individuals or other organizations.\nReligious endowments are typically managed by a board of trustees or other governing bodies, and the income from the endowment is used to support the religious organization\u2019s activities, such as maintaining buildings, paying staff, and providing services to the community.\nIn some cases, religious endowments may be established to support specific programs or initiatives within the organization, such as education, outreach, or social services.\nReligious endowments can be an important source of funding for religious organizations and can help to ensure their long-term financial stability.\nWAQFS\n\nA waqf (also spelt \u201cwaqf\u201d or \u201cwakf\u201d) is a charitable endowment in Islam, similar to a trust in other legal systems. It is a property, such as land or a building, that is donated to a religious organization or institution to be used for charitable purposes.\n\nThe property is held in perpetuity and the income generated from it is used to support the charitable purposes specified by the donor.\nIn India, waqfs are governed by the Waqf Act of 1995, which established a Waqf Board at the national level to oversee the management of waqfs in the country.\nThere are also Waqf Boards at the state level to manage waqfs within each state. Waqfs are typically managed by a mutawalli, or custodian, who is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the waqf and for ensuring that it is used for the purposes specified by the donor.\nWaqfs can be an important source of funding for charitable causes in India, and they can play a role in supporting education, healthcare, and social services for disadvantaged communities.\nTRADE UNIONS\n\nA trade union is an organization of workers that promotes and protects the rights and interests of its members. Trade unions work to improve working conditions, increase pay and benefits, and advocate for workers\u2019 rights.\n\nTrade unions are typically made up of workers who are in the same industry or occupation, and they may be organized on a national, regional, or local level. Trade unions may be affiliated with a larger national or international union organization.\nTrade unions can be an important voice for workers and can play a role in advocating for better working conditions, pay, and benefits.\nThey can also negotiate collective bargaining agreements with employers on behalf of their members. Trade unions may engage in activities such as strikes, protests, and lobbying to achieve their goals.\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the development process is a complex and multifaceted endeavour that involves a wide range of stakeholders.\n\nNGOs, self-help groups, and other community-based organizations can play a crucial role in promoting development and addressing the needs of disadvantaged communities.\n\nDonors, charities, and other funding organizations can also provide important support for development initiatives.\n\nAt the same time, the development industry is not solely the domain of NGOs and other non-profit organizations.\n\nPrivate businesses, governments, and other institutions also have a role to play in promoting development and supporting the growth and prosperity of communities.\n\nEffective development requires the involvement and cooperation of all stakeholders, and these different actors need to work together to identify and address the challenges and opportunities facing communities.\n\nBy fostering collaboration and cooperation, we can create a more sustainable and equitable form of development that benefits all members of society.\n\nArticle Written by: Vivek Rajasekharan"

Read here to learn more.\n\nIn the context of global markets, economic nationalism should be viewed as a collection of strategies to establish, support, and defend national economies.\n\nEconomic crises, nationalist movements, and expanded governments all contributed to the development and institutionalization of economic nationalism in the 20th century.\n\nThis article delves into the intricacies of economic nationalism, examining its historical context, key features, benefits, challenges, and implications in the contemporary world economy.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEconomic Nationalism: Historical Context\nWhat is Economic Nationalism?\nBenefits of Economic Nationalism\nCriticisms\nEconomic Nationalism in the 21st Century\nEconomic nationalism in India\nImpact and Challenges\nConclusion\nEconomic Nationalism: Historical Context\n\nEconomic nationalism is not a new concept; it has roots in the mercantilism of the 16th to the 18th centuries, where nations sought to accumulate wealth primarily through trade surplus and colonization.\n\nThe ideology gained prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, paralleling the rise of nation-states and industrialization, which saw countries imposing tariffs and quotas to protect nascent industries and preserve national wealth.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe post-World War II era, particularly with the establishment of the Bretton Woods system and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), marked a shift towards liberal internationalism, focusing on reducing trade barriers and fostering global economic cooperation.\n\nHowever, the late 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed a resurgence of economic nationalism, driven by globalization\u2019s discontents, financial crises, and geopolitical tensions.\n\nWhat is Economic Nationalism?\n\nEconomic nationalism can be characterized by policies that prioritize national interests, economic independence, and security.\n\nIt manifests in various forms, including protectionism (tariffs, trade barriers), state capitalism (state ownership or control of businesses), and efforts to control foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nThe ideology is underpinned by the belief that the state should have a pivotal role in directing the economy to protect and promote national interests and sovereignty.\n\nUnlike globalization which promotes interdependence among nations, economic nationalists favor tariffs to restrict free trade, promote indigenous industries, and seek import substitution.\n\nProtectionism: Imposing tariffs and non-tariff barriers to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. For instance, the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs imposed in 2018 aimed to protect these industries under national security grounds.\nState Capitalism: Governments taking ownership stakes in key industries or sectors. China\u2019s model, where the state owns or controls significant portions of the economy, including technology and manufacturing sectors, exemplifies state capitalism within an economic nationalist framework.\nForeign Direct Investment Scrutiny: Increasing scrutiny of FDI to prevent foreign control over strategic industries. Examples include the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviewing foreign investments for national security implications.\nBenefits of Economic Nationalism\nProtection of Domestic Industries: By sheltering local industries from international competition, economic nationalism can help preserve jobs and promote industrial development.\nNational Security: Ensuring control over strategic sectors and reducing dependence on foreign entities for critical supplies can enhance national security.\nEconomic Sovereignty: Economic nationalism advocates for a country\u2019s right to pursue its economic policies without external coercion, preserving its sovereignty.\nPrevents drain of foreign exchange: Imports cause a drain of foreign exchange, and the ideology prevents this from misbalancing the trade.\nCriticisms\nTrade Wars and Retaliation: Protectionist policies can lead to trade wars, as countries retaliate with their tariffs, potentially harming global trade.\nEconomic Inefficiency: Protectionism can lead to inefficiencies, as industries shielded from competition may lack incentives to innovate or improve productivity.\nImpact on Global Supply Chains: Economic nationalism can disrupt global supply chains, increasing costs for consumers and businesses and potentially leading to shortages of goods.\nEconomic Nationalism in the 21st Century\n\nThe 21st century has seen a notable rise in economic nationalism, driven by several factors:\n\nGlobal Financial Crises: The 2008 financial crisis led to questioning of the global financial system and calls for more national control over economies.\nGlobalization\u2019s Discontents: While globalization has lifted millions out of poverty, it has also been associated with job losses and wage stagnation in developed economies, fueling nationalist sentiments.\nGeopolitical Tensions: Rising tensions between major powers, such as the U.S. and China, have spurred efforts to decouple economies and regain control over strategic sectors.\n\nThe resurgence of economic nationalism presents both challenges and opportunities for the global economy.\n\nOn one hand, it poses risks to the multilateral trading system and could lead to fragmentation and inefficiencies.\nOn the other hand, it prompts a reevaluation of globalization\u2019s impacts and the need for policies that ensure more equitable growth and resilience against global shocks.\nEconomic nationalism in India\n\nEconomic nationalism in India has been a significant force in shaping the country\u2019s economic policies and strategies since its independence in 1947.\n\nThis approach has gone through various phases, reflecting India\u2019s evolving economic priorities, political ideologies, and the global economic environment. Understanding economic nationalism in India requires an examination of its historical context, key policies, shifts in economic ideology, and the impact of these policies on India\u2019s economic development and position in the global economy.\n\nPost-Independence Era (1947-1991)\n\nIn the aftermath of independence, India, led by its first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and influenced by the economic policies of the British Fabian Society, adopted a model of economic nationalism that emphasized self-reliance, protectionism, and a significant role for the state in economic development.\n\nThe government implemented a mixed economy model, where key industries were nationalized, and the state-controlled critical sectors like mining, telecommunications, and transportation.\nThe Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 and the establishment of the Planning Commission in 1950 were significant steps in this direction, focusing on heavy industries and aiming to reduce dependence on foreign investments and goods.\nThis period was marked by the License Raj, a regulatory system that required businesses to obtain government licenses to set up and run industries.\nWhile this system aimed at protecting domestic industries and preventing monopolies, it eventually led to inefficiencies, slow growth, and corruption.\n\nEconomic Liberalization (1991 Onwards)\n\nThe economic crisis of 1991, characterized by a severe balance of payments problem, forced India to adopt structural reforms and liberalize its economy.\n\nThe New Economic Policy (NEP) introduced in 1991 marked a significant shift from protectionism to integration with the global economy.\nThe reforms included deregulation, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and opening up to foreign investment.\nDespite this shift, economic nationalism continued to play a role in shaping policies that sought to balance liberalization with protecting national interests.\n\nKey Features of Economic Nationalism in India\n\nProtection of Domestic Industries: India has implemented various tariffs and non-tariff barriers to protect its emerging industries. For example, the Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to encourage companies to manufacture their products in India and incentivize domestic production. Other initiatives like Vocal for Local, and Atmanirbhar Bharat also fall under the broader vision of economic nationalism.\nPromotion of Domestic Innovation: Programs like Digital India and Startup India aim to foster innovation within the country, reduce dependencies on foreign technology, and create a self-reliant digital infrastructure.\nStrategic Global Engagement: India\u2019s approach to economic nationalism also involves strategic engagement with the global economy through bilateral trade agreements, participation in international forums, and attracting foreign investment in sectors critical for India\u2019s growth while ensuring that it does not compromise its economic sovereignty.\nImpact and Challenges\n\nEconomic Development: Economic nationalism in India has had a mixed impact. On the one hand, it has helped develop domestic industries, reduce foreign dependence, and improve self-reliance. On the other hand, protectionist policies have sometimes led to inefficiencies and hindered India\u2019s competitiveness in the global market.\n\nBalancing Global Integration and National Interests: One of the significant challenges facing India is balancing its integration into the global economy with protecting its national interests. While foreign investments and technologies are crucial for India\u2019s growth, there is also a need to ensure that this does not lead to a new form of economic dependence.\n\nAddressing Inequalities: Economic nationalism must also address the issue of inequalities within the country. While India has seen significant economic growth, this has not always been evenly distributed. There is a need for policies that ensure that the benefits of economic nationalism and growth reach all sections of society.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs India continues to navigate the challenges of the 21st century, the principles of economic nationalism will likely continue to shape its strategies, aiming to achieve a balance between self-reliance and global integration, and ensuring that economic growth translates into broad-based improvements in living standards for its population.\n\nEconomic nationalism, with its emphasis on prioritizing national interests in economic policy, presents a complex challenge to the liberal international economic order established in the post-World War II era.\n\nWhile it offers potential benefits in terms of protecting domestic industries and enhancing national security, the risks of protectionism, trade wars, and global economic fragmentation cannot be overlooked.\n\nAs the world economy continues to grapple with the ramifications of globalization, technological change, and geopolitical shifts, the debate over the merits and drawbacks of economic nationalism is likely to remain a pivotal issue. Finding a balance that promotes economic sovereignty and national interests while preserving the benefits of global trade and cooperation is one of the foremost challenges facing policymakers today.\n\nRelated article: Dollarization of economy\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

These institutions are established to address and investigate complaints of corruption against public officials and elected representatives. Read here to learn more.\n\nThe institution of the ombudsman originated in Scandinavian countries. The institution of the ombudsman first came into being in Sweden in 1713 when a \u201cchancellor of justice\u201d was appointed by the king to act as an invigilator to look into the functioning of a wartime government.\n\nFrom 1713 the duty of this ombudsman was to mainly ensure the correct conduct of royal officials. The institution of the ombudsman was firmly incorporated into the Swedish constitution from 1809.\n\nIn India, the ombudsman is known as Lokpal or Lokayukata. The concept of a constitutional ombudsman was first proposed by the then-law minister Ashok Kumar Sen in parliament in the early 1960s.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNeed for Lokpal and Lokayukta\nLokpal\nLokayukta\nPowers and Independence\nChallenges and Criticisms of Lokpal and Lokayukta\nConclusion\nNeed for Lokpal and Lokayukta\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

Singhvi as the Indian model of the ombudsman for the redressal of public grievances, it was passed in Lok Sabha.\n\nIn the year 1968, it lapsed with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, and since then has lapsed in the Lok Sabha many times.\n\nThe establishment of Lokpal at the central level and Lokayukta at the state level in India is driven by the need to combat corruption, enhance transparency, and ensure accountability in public administration.\n\nThe creation of these anti-corruption ombudsman institutions addresses various concerns related to corruption in the country.\n\nCorruption Eradication: Lokpal and Lokayukta are institutions specifically designed to investigate and address allegations of corruption against public officials and elected representatives. Their primary objective is to eradicate corruption from the public administration.\nPromoting Accountability: These institutions act as independent bodies responsible for holding public officials accountable for their actions and decisions.\nEnsuring Transparency: By conducting investigations and inquiries into allegations of corruption, Lokpal and Lokayukta contribute to bringing transparency to government functioning.\nBuilding Trust: Establishing anti-corruption bodies demonstrates the government\u2019s commitment to combating corruption, which, in turn, helps build public trust in the administration.\nRestoring Confidence: When citizens see that allegations of corruption are being investigated impartially, it restores confidence in the fairness of public institutions.\nDissuading Corruption: The presence of Lokpal and Lokayukta serves as a deterrent, dissuading public officials from engaging in corrupt practices due to the fear of investigation and subsequent legal action.\nAutonomous Bodies: Lokpal and Lokayukta operate independently of the executive, ensuring that investigations into corruption allegations are not subject to interference from the government.\nChecks and Balances: The existence of independent oversight mechanisms helps maintain a system of checks and balances within the government.\nAccess to Justice: Lokpal and Lokayukta provide a mechanism for citizens to seek justice when they encounter corruption or maladministration in public services.\nEmpowering Whistleblowers: These institutions offer protection to whistleblowers, encouraging individuals to come forward with information about corruption without fear of reprisal.\nExpeditious Handling: The specialized focus of Lokpal and Lokayukta on corruption cases enables them to handle complaints more expeditiously than traditional legal processes.\nFair and Impartial Inquiries: Through swift investigations, these bodies contribute to fair and impartial resolution of corruption cases.\nInternational Standards: Establishing anti-corruption bodies aligns with international best practices and commitments to combat corruption, contributing to the country\u2019s global standing.\nLokpal\n\nLokpal is the apex anti-corruption ombudsman at the central level in India.\n\nThe Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, was enacted by the Indian Parliament to establish the Lokpal at the national level. The Act came into effect on January 16, 2014.\nJurisdiction: Lokpal has jurisdiction over all central government employees, including the Prime Minister, Members of Parliament, and employees of government-owned corporations.\nAppointment: The Lokpal is appointed by the President of India based on the recommendation of a selection committee. The committee includes the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, the Chief Justice of India, or a sitting Supreme Court judge nominated by the Chief Justice.\nFunctions: The Lokpal investigates complaints of corruption against public officials and elected representatives. It can also inquire into allegations of corruption against the Prime Minister, with certain safeguards.\nLokayukta\n\nLokayukta is the anti-corruption ombudsman at the state level in India.\n\nThe Lokayukta Act empowers state governments to establish Lokayuktas. The structure and powers may vary from state to state.\nJurisdiction: Lokayuktas have jurisdiction over state government employees, including the Chief Minister, Ministers, Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), and other public officials.\nAppointment: The Lokayukta is typically appointed by the Governor of the state based on the recommendation of a selection committee. The committee may include the Chief Minister, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, a sitting High Court judge, and others.\nFunctions: Similar to the Lokpal, the Lokayukta investigates allegations of corruption against public officials at the state level. It acts as an independent body to address complaints related to corruption, maladministration, and abuse of power.\nPowers and Independence\nBoth Lokpal and Lokayukta have the power to conduct investigations, summon witnesses, and recommend punitive action against individuals found guilty of corruption.\nTo ensure independence, these bodies operate independently of the government and are granted certain powers to carry out their functions without interference.\nChallenges and Criticisms of Lokpal and Lokayukta\nDespite their noble objectives, both Lokpal and Lokayukta have faced challenges related to delays in appointments, resource constraints, and the need for greater awareness among the public.\nCritics argue that their effectiveness depends on the proactive engagement of citizens, civil society, and other institutions in the fight against corruption.\nWhile the establishment of Lokpal and Lokayukta addresses key concerns, there is a need for sustained efforts to address challenges such as delays in appointments, resource constraints, and ensuring the effectiveness of these institutions.\nPublic awareness campaigns and outreach programs can enhance the effectiveness of Lokpal and Lokayukta by encouraging citizens to report instances of corruption and maladministration.\nConclusion\n\nLokpal and Lokayukta play crucial roles in the Indian governance system to combat corruption and promote transparency and accountability. These institutions are essential for upholding ethical standards in public service and ensuring that allegations of corruption are thoroughly investigated and addressed. However, ongoing efforts are needed to strengthen their functioning and address any challenges they may face.\n\nThe continued strengthening of these institutions, coupled with broader systemic reforms, is essential for creating a more transparent, accountable, and corruption-free governance system in India.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nNon-Constitutional Bodies in India (Statutory and Non-Statutory Bodies)\nProbity in governance\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The decisions of tribunals are subject to judicial review, and the High Courts and the Supreme Court can adjudicate matters related to the constitutional validity of laws and actions of tribunals.\n\nTribunals in India\n\nTribunals operate under specific laws related to the subject matter they deal with.\n\nNational Green Tribunal (NGT):\n\nEstablished: 2010\nJurisdiction: Environmental matters, including conservation of forests and other natural resources, and enforcement of environmental laws.\nPowers: Adjudication of civil cases related to environmental protection and conservation.\n\nCentral Administrative Tribunal (CAT):\n\nEstablished: 1985\nJurisdiction: Service matters related to the recruitment and conditions of service of government employees.\nPowers: Adjudication of disputes and complaints related to government employees.\n\nArmed Forces Tribunal (AFT):\n\nEstablished: 2009\nJurisdiction: Matters related to the armed forces, including disputes and service-related issues of military personnel.\nPowers: Adjudication of cases involving armed forces personnel.\n\nIncome Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT):\n\nEstablished: 1941\nJurisdiction: Income tax matters, including appeals against orders of the Commissioner of Income Tax.\nPowers: Adjudication of appeals related to income tax disputes.\n\nSecurities Appellate Tribunal:\n\nEstablished: 1992\nJurisdiction: Matters related to securities and capital markets, including appeals against decisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).\nPowers: Adjudication of disputes in the securities market.\n\nCompetition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT) \u2013 Repealed:\n\nRepealed: In 2017, the Competition Appellate Tribunal was dissolved, and its functions were transferred to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).\n\nTelecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT):\n\nEstablished: 2000\nJurisdiction: Matters related to the telecommunications sector, including disputes and appeals in the telecom industry.\nPowers: Adjudication of disputes in the telecom sector.\n\nNational Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT):\n\nEstablished: 2016 (NCLT), 2016 (NCLAT)\nJurisdiction: Corporate and company law matters, including insolvency and bankruptcy cases.\nPowers: Adjudication of cases related to corporate disputes and insolvency proceedings.\n\nConsumer Disputes Redressal Commissions:\n\nEstablished: At the state, district, and national levels\nJurisdiction: Consumer disputes, including cases related to product defects, deficiency in services, and unfair trade practices.\nPowers: Adjudication of consumer complaints and appeals.\n\nState Administrative Tribunals (SATs):\n\nEstablished: In various states\nJurisdiction: Service matters related to the recruitment and conditions of service of state government employees.\nPowers: Adjudication of disputes and complaints related to state government employees.\nChallenges\n\nDespite the advantages of specialized tribunals in India, challenges such as delays, vacancies in tribunal posts, and the need for consistent jurisprudence have been noted.\n\nThere have been discussions on reforms, including the proposed introduction of the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalization and Conditions of Service) Bill 2021 to streamline the functioning of tribunals.\nAs quasi-judicial bodies, they have the same degree of independence from the Executive as the courts that they replace.\nOne of the key purposes of tribunals is to reduce the workload of courts so that there is quicker disposal of cases. However, even some tribunals face the issue of a large backlog of cases.\nThe lack of human resources (such as an inadequate number of judges) is observed to be one of the key reasons for the accumulation of pending cases in courts.\nConclusion\n\nThe tribunals in India play a vital role in ensuring the swift resolution of disputes in specific areas, thereby reducing the burden on traditional courts and providing specialized expertise in the adjudication process. They contribute to the efficiency of the legal system and the delivery of justice in their respective domains.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nForeigners tribunal\nDebt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs)\nInter-State River Water Disputes in India\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

In a mixed economy, the government plays a role in the economy by providing certain public goods and services, regulating certain industries, and redistributing income. At the same time, the private sector is allowed to operate and compete freely in certain areas.\n\nIn India, the mixed economy was introduced as part of the country\u2019s efforts to modernize and develop its economy after independence.

Under this system, landlords (zamindars) were allowed to collect rent from tenants, who had little security of tenure. The government abolished the zamindari system in the 1950s, which led to the redistribution of land to tenants and the creation of a more equitable land ownership system.\nLand ceiling laws: These laws set a maximum limit on the amount of land that an individual or group could own. Any land above the ceiling limit was required to be redistributed to landless or small farmers.\nTenancy reform: Tenancy reform laws were implemented to improve the security of tenure of tenants and to give them the right to purchase the land they were cultivating.\nConsolidation of holdings: This process involved the consolidation of small, fragmented plots of land into larger, more efficient units that were easier to manage and cultivate.\n\nTo know more about the land reforms in India click here\n\nAgricultural reforms in India\n\nAgricultural reforms are measures taken by governments to improve the efficiency and productivity of the agricultural sector.

It outlined the legal framework for postal services in India.\nAnother important legislation related to the post office was the Indian Post Office Act of 1908, which amended certain provisions of the 1898 Act.\nThe Indian Post Office Act, 1898, underwent a comprehensive revision, and the Indian Post Office Act, 1978, came into existence. This legislation continued to govern postal services in India for several years.\nThe Department of Posts (DOP) Act, 1986, was enacted to provide statutory status to the Department of Posts. This act aimed at better management and organization of postal services.\n\nRead:\u00a0Postal History of India\n\nPost Office Bill 2023\n\nThe Bill replaces the Indian Post Office Act, of 1898. \u00a0The Act regulates India Post, a departmental undertaking of the central government.\n\nThe government will not have exclusive privilege over conveying letters. \u00a0Services to be provided by India Post will be prescribed under the Rules.\nThe Director General of Postal Services will be appointed to head India Post. \u00a0He will have powers to make regulations on various matters including tariffs for services and supply of postage stamps.\nThe government may intercept an article transmitted through India Post on specified grounds, including the security of the state and public order.\nIndia Post will not incur any liability concerning its services, except any liability prescribed through Rules.\nHow is the new Bill different from the old act?\n\nExclusive privileges of the central government:\u00a0\n\nThe Act provides that wherever the central government establishes posts, it will have the exclusive privilege of conveying letters by post, as well as incidental services such as receiving, collecting, sending, and delivering letters.

He may also make regulations regarding charges for services, and supply and sale of postage stamps and postal stationery.\n\nPowers to intercept postal articles:\n\nThe Act allows interception of an article being transmitted through a post on certain grounds.\nAn interception may be carried out on the occurrence of any public emergency, or in the interest of public safety or tranquillity. Such interceptions may be carried out by the central government, state governments, or any officer specially authorized by them.\nAn intercepted shipment can be detained or disposed of by the officer in charge. The officer also has powers to open, detain, or destroy shipments carrying items prohibited under the Act or any other law.\n\nThe Bill instead provides that interception of an article being transmitted through post may be carried out on the following grounds:\n\nthe security of the state,\nfriendly relations with foreign states,\npublic order,\nemergency,\npublic safety, or\ncontravention of the provisions of the Bill or any other laws. An officer empowered by the central government through a notification may carry out interception.\n\nExamination of postal articles prohibited under law or liable for duty:\u00a0\n\nUnder the Act, an officer in charge may examine a postal article if he suspects that it contains goods which are prohibited, or are liable to be paid duty upon.\nThe Bill removes the powers of examination. It instead provides that in such cases, the central government may empower an officer of India Post to deliver the postal article to the customs authority or any other specified authority.\u00a0 The authority will then deal with the item in question.\n\nExemptions from liability:\n\nThe Act exempts the government from any liability related to the loss, misdelivery, delay, or damage to a postal article. This does not apply where the liability is undertaken by the central government in express terms. Officers are also exempt from such liability unless they have acted fraudulently or wilfully.\nThe Bill retains these exemptions. It also provides that the central government may prescribe liability about services by India Post under the Rules.\n\nRemoval of offenses and penalties:\n\nThe Act specified various offenses and penalties, all of which were removed by the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023.\nFor instance, theft, misappropriation, or destruction of postal articles by an officer of the Post Office was punishable with imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine.\nSending certain prohibited items through post was punishable with imprisonment up to one year, a fine, or both.\nThe Bill does not provide for any offenses or consequences, except one. Amounts not paid by a user will be recoverable as arrears of land revenue.\nIssues with Post Office Bill 2023\nThe Bill does not specify procedural safeguards for interception of articles transmitted through India Post. \u00a0 Lack of safeguards may violate the freedom of speech and expression and the right to privacy of individuals.\nThe grounds for interception include \u2018emergency\u2019, which may be beyond reasonable restrictions under the Constitution.\nThe Bill exempts India Post from liability for lapses in postal services. \u00a0Liability may be prescribed through Rules by the central government, which also administers India Post. \u00a0This may lead to a conflict of interest.\nThe Bill does not specify any offences and penalties. \u00a0For instance, there are no consequences for the unauthorized opening of postal articles by a postal officer. \u00a0This may have adverse implications for the right to privacy of consumers.\nPost office Act 2023\n\nThe Post Office Act, 2023 received the assent of Hon\u2019ble President of India on 24th\u00a0December 2023 and was published in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, Part II, Section 1, dated 24th\u00a0December 2023 by Ministry of Law & Justice (Legislative Department) for general information.\n\nThe Act aims to create a simple legislative framework for delivery of citizen centric services, banking services and benefits of Government schemes at the last mile.\nThe Act does away with provisions such as the exclusive privilege of collecting, processing and delivering of letters, to enhance the ease of doing business and ease of living.\nNo penal provisions have been prescribed in the Act.\nThis provides a framework for prescribing standards for addressing of the items, address identifiers and usage of postcodes.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Read further to know more.\n\nIndia, as a federal republic, has undertaken a significant journey in devolving powers and finances to local levels, recognizing the importance of grassroots governance. The process of decentralization aims to empower local bodies, enhance participatory democracy, and address the diverse needs of communities.\n\nWhile progress has been made, challenges persist in effectively implementing devolution, posing hurdles to achieving true local self-governance.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDevolution of Powers\nThe 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act\n74th Constitutional Amendment Act\n74th Constitutional Amendment Act\u2019s goals\nThe 74th Constitutional Amendment Act\u2019s key features\nChallenges\nFinance Commission (Devolution of Power)\nComposition of the Indian Finance Commission\nThe Finance Commission\u2019s functions\nParastatals (Autonomous/semi-autonomous institutions)\nUrban Local Finance\nPanchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996\nUrban local government\nRural local finance\nSpecial Provisions for some states\nDevolution of Powers\n\nThe devolution of powers and finances to local levels in India represents a crucial step toward inclusive and responsive governance. While there have been commendable achievements, persistent challenges require strategic interventions.\n\nStrengthening fiscal decentralization, enhancing local capacities, ensuring uniform devolution, and mitigating political interference are imperative for the success of this transformative process.\n\nThe journey towards effective devolution is an ongoing one, demanding sustained commitment, innovation, and collaboration to realize the vision of empowered local self-governance.\n\nConstitutional Provisions:\u00a0The 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Constitution of India in 1992 mandated the establishment of Panchayats and Municipalities, outlining their powers and functions. This constitutional backing provided a strong foundation for devolution.\nParticipatory Governance:\u00a0Devolution of power encourages citizen participation in decision-making processes. Local bodies are better positioned to understand the unique needs of their communities, leading to more responsive and accountable governance.\nCapacity Building:\u00a0Devolution of power promotes the building of local leadership and administrative capacities. It allows local representatives to gain valuable experience and skills in governance, fostering a culture of self-reliance.\nTailored Development:\u00a0Local bodies can design and implement development programs tailored to their specific requirements. This flexibility enables targeted interventions, especially in areas with unique challenges.\nThe 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act\n\nThe Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act was passed in 1992 and came into effect on 24 April 1993. The evolution of the Devolution of Powers and Finances Act empowered state governments to take the necessary steps that would lead to the formalization of the gram panchayats and help them operate as units of self-governance\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nLong before the act was implemented in 1992, village panchayats were already in use in India, but the system had several flaws that prevented it from serving as the people\u2019s government or responding to their demands. This was caused by several things, including a lack of funding, the absence of regular elections, and the underrepresentation of weaker groups, such as women and scheduled castes and tribes.\n\nAccording to Article 40 of the Directive Principles of State Policy in the Indian Constitution, the government must make it easier for gram panchayats to get started and run efficiently.\n\nThe 73rd Amendment Act was introduced by the central government of India in 1992 to solve these problems and enhance local self-government.\n\nPart IX: The Panchayats is a new chapter that was added to the Constitution as a result of this Act.\n\nThe following are some of the main characteristics of the act:\nThe Panchayati Raj institutions in the nation are now constitutional bodies thanks to this Act.\nEvery state is now required, by Article 243-B, to create panchayats within its borders.\nArticle 243-G requires the state governments to give the panchayats power, responsibility, and authority.\nThe term of office for gram panchayats is set at 5 years.\nVillage panchayat elections can be held independently thanks to a system made available to state election authorities.\nFor the proper representation of women and SC/STs, see Article 243-D.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Panchayati Raj (73rd Constitutional Amendment Act) \u2013 ClearIAS\n\n74th Constitutional Amendment Act\n\nMunicipalities or Urban Local Bodies were made constitutionally recognized by the 74th Amendment Act. The 74th Amendment Act sought to establish an institutional framework for democratic decentralization or grassroots democracy through autonomous local governments in the nation\u2019s cities. Additionally, it granted the ULBs the authority to carry out the 18 tasks stated in the Indian Constitution\u2019s 12th Schedule.\n\n74th Constitutional Amendment Act\u2019s goals\nMunicipalities now have constitutional status thanks to the statute. They now fall under the protection of the Constitution\u2019s justiciable provisions as a result.\nIn other words, state governments must implement the new municipal system in compliance with the act\u2019s requirements within the terms of their constitutions.\nFor municipal governments to properly serve as local government units, the legislation aims to improve and reinvigorate them.\nThe 74th Constitutional Amendment Act\u2019s key features\nThree Different Types of Municipalities\nThe act stipulates that the following three categories of municipalities must be established in each state.\nFor a transitory area, a Nagar Panchayat (by whatever name called).\na municipal government for a smaller city.\na municipal body serving a more significant urban region.\nThere is, however, one exception: the governor may designate a municipality as an industrial township if it contains an urban area where an industrial facility provides municipal services. A municipality may not be established in such a situation.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Evolution of Local Self-Government (Panchayati Raj System) in India \u2013 Clear IAS\n\nChallenges\nResource Constraints: Many local bodies face financial constraints, limiting their ability to execute development projects effectively. Over-reliance on state and central grants pose a challenge to financial autonomy.\nPolitical Interference: Despite constitutional provisions, political interference from higher levels of government remains a challenge. Local bodies may find their decisions subject to external influences, undermining true autonomy.\nCapacity Gaps:\u00a0Some local bodies may lack the requisite administrative and technical capabilities. Insufficient training and support hinder their capacity to plan and implement projects efficiently.\nUnequal Devolution: Devolution is not uniform across states and regions, leading to disparities in local governance structures. Some areas may enjoy greater autonomy and resources than others, exacerbating existing socio-economic imbalances.\nFinance Commission (Devolution of Power)\n\nA constitutional authority known as the Finance Commission is responsible for allocating specific revenue resources between the Union Government and the State Governments. It was created by the Indian President by Article 280 of the Indian Constitution. It was developed to lay forth the terms of the Center\u2019s and the States\u2019 financial dealings. It began in 1951.\n\nConcerning the Finance Commission\u2019s recommendations, the President must present each house of Parliament with the recommendation and the explanatory letter( Article 281.).\n\nThe Finance Commission is established by the President of India every five years or whenever he deems it essential.\n\nComposition of the Indian Finance Commission\nChairman and Members of the Finance Commission\nThe chairman is in charge of the Commission and oversees its operations. He ought to have some background in public affairs.\n4 Members.\nThe qualifications of the Commission\u2019s members and the procedures used in choosing them are legally determined by the Parliament.\nThe Finance Commission\u2019s functions\n\nOn the following matters, the Finance Commission advises the President of India:\n\nThe division of net tax proceeds between the federal government and the states, as well as the distribution of those proceeds among the states.\nThe guidelines by which the Center distributes grants in help to the states from the Consolidated Fund of India.\nThe actions necessary to expand a state\u2019s consolidated fund to increase the resources of its municipalities and panchayats are based on suggestions provided by the state finance commission.\nAny other issue that the president refers to is in the interest of solid financial management.\nEvery five years, the Commission determines the rules governing grants-in-aid to the states as well as the basis for dividing taxes between the federal government and the states.\nThe President may refer to the Commission any subject that is in the interest of prudent financial management.\nThe recommendations of the Commission are presented to the Houses of Parliament together with a note explaining the government\u2019s response to them.\nTo allocate resources to the state\u2019s Panchayats and Municipalities, the FC assesses the growth in the Consolidated Fund of the state.\nThe FC has enough authority to carry out its duties within its area of responsibility.\nThe FC has all the authority of a Civil Court by the Code of Civil Procedure from 1908. It has the authority to call witnesses and request the production of any public record or document from a court or office.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Finance Commission of India \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nParastatals (Autonomous/semi-autonomous institutions)\n\nInstitutions or organizations that are entirely or partially owned and run by the government are known as parastatals (either autonomous or quasi-governmental).\n\nThey may be established by the Societies Registration Act or particular State laws. These organizations are typically created to supply certain services or carry out particular plans or initiatives supported by national or international donor organizations.\nThe District Rural Development Agency (DRDA), the District Health Society (DHS), the District Water and Sanitation Committee (DWSC), and the Fish Farmers Development Agency are some of the significant parastatals (FFDA).\nThe DRDA is the most significant parastatal at the district level. The majority of the centrally sponsored schemes, including the Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY), Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY), and Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY), currently receive funding through the DRDA, which then distributes it to implementing organizations at the block level.\nGram Panchayats in particular have implementation and monitoring responsibilities for several of these initiatives.\nUrban Local Finance\n\nAs allowed by the relevant municipal regulations, Municipal Corporations and Municipalities raise their funds from a variety of sources.\n\nTheir sources of income originate from\n\n\u00a0Taxes; (ii) Fees and Penalties; and (iii) Income from Municipal Enterprises, such as Land, Tanks, Markets, Shops, etc\nAdditionally, the State provides grants to these organizations.\nThe primary source of revenue for the majority of urban municipal governments is the property tax on land and structures.\nThey also levy taxes on professionals, advertisements, and other things. In Western India, octroi is still a significant source of revenue for local governments.\nThe current trend is to abolish this charge because it interferes with the smooth flow of traffic on highways.\nFor violations of local laws and ordinances, municipalities also impose fines. Municipalities frequently make substantial money through their stores, marketplaces, and rest areas.\nStates frequently give grants to their municipal organizations to boost their financial situation. State grants-in-aid may be given on an as-needed basis or by specified criteria, such as population size, the concentration of slums in an area, the location of the town, etc.\nUrban bodies collect a variety of taxes and fees, including property tax, sewerage tax, fire tax, animal and vehicle tax, theatre tax, duty on property transfers, octroi duty on some commodities transported into the city, education cess (tax), and professional tax.\nPanchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996\n\nThe Government of India passed PESA as a law to protect \u201cScheduled Areas,\u201d which are not protected by the 73rd Constitutional Amendment. The provisions of Part IX are expanded to the nation\u2019s Scheduled Areas by this specific act. The Gram Sabha level was further lowered under PESA. The Panchayat Act gave the Gram Sabha a wide range of powers, including the ability to consult on land purchase, possess small forest products, and lease minor minerals.PESA went into effect as the Indian economy began to open all of its borders to foreign direct investment.\n\nThe mining industry, which is primarily found in the country\u2019s scheduled regions where PESA operates, was made available to MNCs and the Indian corporate sector for the cheap exploitation of mineral resources. One of the standout aspects of PESA is its idea that every Gram Sabha should be capable of defending and preserving the people\u2019s traditions and customs, their cultural identity, local resources, and the traditional means of resolving disputes.\n\nThe Gram Sabha or Panchayats at the appropriate level shall have the following powers:\n\nTo be consulted for land acquisition and relocation issues.\nConcessions and prospecting licenses should be granted for the extraction of minor minerals.\nPlanning and managing small bodies of water.\nThe authority to impose prohibitions, regulate, or place restrictions on the sale and use of any intoxicants.\nOwnership of small-scale forest products.\nThe ability to stop land alienation and restore any illegally alienated land belonging to a scheduled tribe.\nThe ability to control local markets.\nThe ability to exercise control over the lending of money to certain tribes.\nWhile granting Gram Sabhas or Panchayats such extensive powers, PESA has additionally mandated that States grant Panchayats the requisite powers and authority to enable them to function as institutions of self-government.\nUrban local government\n\nUrban local government alludes to the populace governing an urban region through their elected officials. Local urban bodies now have constitutional status thanks to the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992.\n\n74th Amendment to the Constitution added \u00a0\u201cThe Municipalities\u201d part IX-A and a new Twelfth Schedule with 18 useful elements for municipalities were added by this measure.\n\nThe main elements of this Act can be divided into two categories: mandatory and optional. Some of the mandatory clauses that apply to all States include:\n\nThe establishment of Nagar Panchayats, Municipal Councils, and Municipal Corporations in Transitional Areas, Smaller Urban Areas, and Larger Urban Areas, correspondingly;\nReservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in urban local bodies, usually according to their population;\nReserving up to one-third of the seats for women;\nElections for urban local self-governing units will be held by the State Election Commission, which was established to oversee elections for Panchayati raj bodies (see 73rd Amendment);\nThe local urban self-governing bodies\u2019 financial affairs will be investigated by the State Finance Commission, which was established to handle the finances of the Panchayati Raj organizations;\nUrban municipal self-governing entities have a five-year term limit, and if dissolved early, new elections must be held within six months;\nRural local finance\n\nPanchayats mostly rely on subsidies from the State Government for funding. Additionally, they can tax and receive some income from their own or vested assets. They might get a portion of the state government\u2019s levied and collected taxes, charges, tolls, and other fees.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the financial resources Panchayats have at their disposal to carry out their duties.\n\nGram Panchayat: In the majority of States, Gram Panchayats have the authority to impose taxes. Some of the taxes and fees charged by the village include a house tax, a tax on livestock, an immovable property tax, a tax on commercial crops, a drainage tax, a sanitation fee, a tax on products sold in the village, a cost for providing water to households, and a tax on lights. Additionally, panchayats have the authority to impose amusement taxes on animals, non-mechanically driven vehicles, and temporarily erected theatres. Additionally, Gram Panchayats earn money as income from land they possess such as common areas, jungles, cow pastures, etc. Gram Panchayats also keep the sales revenue from carcasses (killed animals) and manure refuse. Additionally, the State pays them their fair share of land revenue.\nPanchayat Samiti: Panchayat Samitis has the authority to levy taxes on services they offer, such as water for drinking or irrigation, lighting systems, and tolls for bridges they manage. Public roads built or maintained with their funding, as well as all land or other property granted to them by the Panchayats, are included in the property owned by Panchayat Samitis. Additionally, the State Governments give them grants. State governments or Zila Panchayats provide money along with plans for Panchayati Raj\u2019s intermediary entities to carry out.\nZila Parishad: Zila Parishads have the power to levy taxes. They have the authority to impose taxes on individuals who have operated a business in rural areas for six months, brokers, commission agents, and the sale of goods in their established marketplaces. Zila Parishads may also impose a tax on land revenue. The necessary funds are also provided when development plans are committed to them. Additionally, they get donations from philanthropic organizations, grants from the government, and maybe even loans.\nSpecial Provisions for some states\n\nThe Part XXI of the constitution\u2019s Article 371 to 371-J has particular provisions for eleven states. The purpose of these provisions is to address the needs of the residents of underdeveloped areas of the states, to safeguard the cultural and economic interests of the tribes living in the states, to deal with the erratic law and order situation in some areas of the states, or to advance the local population\u2019s interests. The original constitution did not include these constitutions. They have since been included in numerous modifications.\n\nRead:\u00a0States Borrowing Power; Fiscal Federalism\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

Examples include defense, foreign affairs, atomic energy, and currency.\nResiduary Powers: The Union government has residuary powers, meaning it can legislate on matters not explicitly mentioned in any of the three lists.\nNational Security and Defense: Formulating and executing policies related to national security and defense; Maintenance of armed forces and the conduct of foreign affairs.\nInternational Relations:\u00a0Conducting foreign affairs, including the establishment and maintenance of diplomatic missions abroad.\nMonetary System:\u00a0Control over the currency and coinage; Regulation of banking and financial institutions.\nInter-State Trade and Commerce:\u00a0Regulation of inter-state trade and commerce.\nEmergency Powers:\u00a0The Union government has special powers during times of emergency, as outlined in the Constitution.\nRailways and Airways:\u00a0Control and development of railways and airways.\nElection Commission:\u00a0Oversight of national elections through the Election Commission of India.\nFunctions of States Government\n\nThe state government is entitled to ensure the proper implementation of law and order within the state territory.

Union List, State List, and Concurrent List are the three lists, that are included.\n\nThe union list outlines the topics that Parliament may legislate on.\nThe individuals covered by state legislatures are listed by state list.\nOn the other hand, the concurrent list includes topics within the purview of the state legislatures and the Parliament. However, in a conflict, the Constitution grants federal supremacy to Parliament on concurrent list items.\n\nIt is evident from the preceding system that the Union List includes matters of national importance and those that call for national legislation to be uniform.\n\nIn the State List, issues of regional and local significance are mentioned, and issues that allow for diverse interests.\n\nThe concurrent list includes the topics where having uniform laws across the nation is desired but unnecessary. As a result, it supports both consistency and diversity.\n\nFederal System of Government\n\nA federal government is one in which the Constitution divides the Functions and Responsibilities of the Union and the States, each of which is in charge of its territory.\n\nHowever, because of a power lean toward the center in the Indian federal form of government. The federal features of the Constitution of India are:\n\nDual Polity: The Constitution establishes a dual polity consisting of the Union at the Centre and the states at the periphery. Each is endowed with sovereign powers to be exercised in the field assigned to them by the Constitution\nWritten Constitution: It specifies the structure, organization, powers, and functions of both the Central and state governments and prescribes the limits within which they must operate. Thus, it avoids misunderstandings and disagreements between the two\nDivision of Powers: The Constitution divided the powers between the Centre and the states in terms of the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule\nSupremacy of the Constitution: The Constitution is the supreme (or the highest) law of the land. The laws enacted by the Centre and the states must conform to its provisions.\nIndependent Judiciary: The Constitution establishes an independent judiciary headed by the Supreme Court to settle the disputes between the Centre and the states or between the states\n\nHowever, the Indian federal system of government has a power tilt towards the center:\n\nStrong Centre: The division of powers is in favor of the Centre, The Union List contains more subjects than the State List. The more important subjects have been included in the Union List. The Centre has overriding authority over the Concurrent List. Finally, the residuary powers have also been left with the Centre\nStates Not Indestructible: The states in India have no right to territorial integrity. The Parliament can by unilateral action change the area, boundaries, or name of any state\nThe flexibility of the Constitution: The bulk of the Constitution can be amended by the unilateral action of the Parliament, either by a simple majority or by a special majority. Further, the power to initiate an amendment to the Constitution lies only with the Centre\nNo Equality of State Representation: The states are given representation in the Rajya Sabha based on population.\nEmergency Provisions: During an emergency, the Central government becomes all-powerful and the states go into total control of the Centre. It converts the federal structure into a unitary one without a formal amendment of the Constitution\nParliament\u2019s Authority Over State List: The Parliament is empowered to legislate on any subject of the State List if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to that effect in the National Interest. This means that the legislative competence of the Parliament can be extended without amending the Constitution\nVeto Over State Bills: The governor is empowered to reserve certain types of bills passed by the state legislature for the consideration of the President. The President can withhold his assent to such bills not only in the first instance but also in the second instance\n\nThe division of powers outlined in the Constitution is designed to ensure a balance between a strong central authority and regional autonomy. In case of a conflict between laws made by the Union and the States on the same subject in the Concurrent List, the Union law prevails. The Constitution also provides for the establishment of inter-state councils to promote coordination between the Union and the States.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

Here are some key points related to the right to health:\n\nThe origin of the right to health dates back to 1946, when the World Health Organisation (WHO) was established to develop health-related policies as human rights.\nThe right to health is an integral part of human dignity and is the responsibility of governments to uphold and enhance all individuals, regardless of their gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or socioeconomic status.\nPart IV of the Constitution, under the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), guarantees social and economic justice to its citizens. Therefore, Part IV of the Constitution directly or indirectly relates to public policy in terms of health.\nThe right to health includes access to healthcare services, medicines, and basic sanitation facilities without discrimination, as well as the right to information and participation in decision-making processes related to health policies and programs.\nThe right to health is closely linked to other human rights, such as the right to food, housing, education, and a healthy environment, and it is essential for achieving sustainable development and reducing inequality.\nThe right to health is not just an individual right but also a collective responsibility of the government, civil society, private sector, and international community to work together towards achieving universal health coverage and ensuring that no one is left behind.\nInternational Recognition\n\nThe right to health is recognized in several international documents, including:\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in Article 25, states that \u201ceveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care.\u201d\nThe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) in Article 12, recognizes \u201cthe right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\u201d\n\nThe right to health is also elaborated in regional human rights instruments, such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the American Convention on Human Rights.\n\nEfforts to realize the right to health involve a combination of legal, policy, and practical measures, including healthcare system reforms, public health initiatives, and efforts to address social determinants of health. International organizations, civil society, and governments work together to promote and protect this fundamental right.\n\nImportance of Right to Health\n\nThe right to health implies that healthcare, goods, and services should be accessible to all without discrimination. This includes access to healthcare facilities, essential medicines, clean water, and adequate nutrition.\n\nThe right to health is an essential human right, and it is the responsibility of the government to take steps to ensure that all people have access to healthcare services. This includes promoting health education, providing preventive healthcare measures, and ensuring access to curative healthcare services.\nWide access to health services is crucial to ensure that everyone can access the services they need to maintain good health and well-being. This includes ensuring that healthcare services are available in all regions of the country and that healthcare facilities are equipped with necessary medical equipment and supplies.\nQuality healthcare services are also essential to ensure that people receive effective care that meets their needs and contributes to their overall well-being. This includes ensuring that healthcare providers are adequately trained and have the necessary skills and knowledge to provide high-quality care.\nRight-based healthcare services also aim to reduce out-of-pocket expenditure for health services by providing affordable and accessible care to all people, regardless of their ability to pay. This can help protect people from the financial consequences of paying for health services out of their own pockets and reduce the risk of people getting pushed into poverty.\nBy reducing the financial burden of healthcare costs, right-based healthcare services can help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to access the care they need to maintain good health. This can contribute to improving health outcomes and reducing health inequalities among different groups of people.\nRight to Health in India\n\nHere are some key points related to the right to health in India:\n\nIndia is a signatory of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) by the United Nations, which grants the right to a standard of living adequate for health and well-being, including food, clothing, housing, medical care, and necessary social services.\nArticle 21 of the Constitution of India guarantees a fundamental right to life and personal liberty, and the right to health is inherent to a life with dignity.\nThe Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) in Articles 38, 39, 42, 43, and 47 put an obligation on the state to ensure the effective realization of the right to health for all its citizens.\nThe Supreme Court of India has made significant judicial pronouncements related to the right to health. In the Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity case (1996), the court held that in a welfare state, the primary duty of the government is to secure the welfare of the people, and the government must provide adequate medical facilities for its people.\nIn its landmark judgment in Parmanand Katara Vs Union of India (1989), the Supreme Court ruled that every doctor, whether at a government hospital or otherwise, has the professional obligation to extend their services with due expertise for protecting life.\nThe right to health in India also includes access to clean water, sanitation, and a healthy environment, as well as the right to information and participation in decision-making processes related to health policies and programs.\nIndia has made significant progress in improving access to healthcare services and reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, but challenges remain in addressing inequalities in healthcare access and quality, particularly for marginalized communities.\nChallenges in India\n\nIndia\u2019s healthcare system faces multiple challenges that hinder its ability to provide adequate healthcare services to its citizens. A few prominent challenges are:\n\nInadequate Infrastructure\n\nEven though there have been some recent improvements, India\u2019s healthcare infrastructure continues to be insufficient, particularly in rural areas.\nThe country has 1.4 beds per 1,000 people, 1 doctor per 1,445 people, and 1.7 nurses per 1,000 people, which is not enough to meet the growing demand for healthcare services.\nOver 75% of the healthcare infrastructure is concentrated in metro cities, where only 27% of the total population resides. This means that the rest of the population, which makes up 73%, lacks access to even basic medical facilities.\n\nGovernment Spending\n\nIndia\u2019s healthcare financing system is restricted, and there is minimal public spending on healthcare.\nThis limits the government\u2019s ability to invest in healthcare infrastructure and resources, which can lead to inadequate healthcare services for individuals.\nThe Government of India spent 2.1% of its GDP on healthcare in FY23, which is much lower than the average health spending share of the GDP, which is around 5.2% of the Lower- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC).\n\nDisease Burden Level\n\nIn India, both communicable and non-communicable diseases pose a significant burden, including Tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Diabetes, etc\nAddressing these diseases necessitates a substantial investment in healthcare infrastructure and resources.\nA report by Frontiers in Public Health found that over 33% of the Indian population still suffers from infectious diseases among the total ailing population.\nThe per capita out-of-pocket (OOP) expense for infectious diseases is INR 7.28 for inpatient care and INR 29.38 for outpatient care.\nConclusion\n\nIndia\u2019s healthcare system is facing significant challenges in terms of inadequate healthcare infrastructure, high disease burden, gender disparities, etc. While there have been recent improvements in the healthcare sector, particularly in urban areas, rural areas, and poor households still lack basic medical facilities and access to healthcare. Addressing these issues requires significant investment in healthcare infrastructure and resources, as well as policies and programs to address gender disparities and increase public spending on healthcare.\n\nRead: Patients safety rights\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

The core objectives of Indian federalism are unity in diversity, decentralization in administration, and devolution in authority. The state will be able to pursue the goal of common welfare amid diversity through federalism.\n\nDue to the uniqueness of the Indian federal system, there arise many issues & challenges about the federal structure.

Wheare, a federal theorist, has maintained that the Indian Constitution is quasi-federal. as it represents the features of federation and union.\nThe Supreme Court of India\u00a0concluded in Sat Pal v State of Punjab and Ors (1969) that the Indian Constitution is more quasi-federal than federal\u00a0or unitary.\n\u00a0As per Article 1 of the Indian Constitution, \u201cIndia that is Bharat shall be a Union of States.\u201d Federalism in India was not about coming together of the states to form the Federal Union. But, it was a conversion of a unitary to a federal system.\nThe federal system in India is considered one of a kind in the world. It is also regarded as \u2018federation sui generis\u2019, which means a federation of its kind. The federalism system in India is a compromise between autonomy enjoyed by the states and the need for strong central governance.\nThe federalism system in India is a relationship between the Central government and State governments. In the Indian system of federalism, there are two tiers of government, and each tier has its distinctive power and judiciary system. However, the Central judiciary lies in the hands of the Supreme Court of India.\nIndian federal system is one of a kind and is different from the systems practiced in the United States of America.\n\u00a0However, due to the quasi-federal system, many issues & challenges about the federal structure arise in India.\nProvisions in the Constitution to Ensure Federal structure\nArticles 245 to 254 of the Indian Constitution outline the states and the Centre\u2019s separate legislative powers.\n7th\u00a0Schedule: The listings in the Constitution\u2019s 7th Schedule \u2014 Union, State, and concurrent \u2014 also demonstrate a fair distribution of powers, with each level of government having its realm, allowing for context-sensitive decision-making.\nArticle 263:\u00a0Article 263\u00a0established an Inter-State Council to ensure a seamless transition of commerce between the Union and the states, as well as the resolution of disputes.\nArticle 280:\u00a0Article 280\u00a0established the Finance Commission, which was charged with defining the Union\u2019s and states\u2019 financial relationships and terms.\n73rd\u00a0and 74th Amendments:\u00a0The 73rd and 74th Amendments further provided structures for local self-government to improve grassroots democracy.\nArticle 200: Article 200 of the Indian Constitution stipulated that the states must obey the laws made by the Central government during emergencies and it empowers the Union Government to earn more power.\nInstitutions for Federalism: The Planning Commission was always\u00a0open to debate on matters relating to the polity\u2019s federal nature and was attentive\u00a0to the various developmental needs of states.\nInter-state tribunals, the National Development Council, and other informal bodies have acted as platforms for dialogue between the Union, states, and UTs.\nIssues and Challenges Pertaining to Federal Structure\n\nBut like all political systems, it will have its fair share of challenges. Below are some of the challenges regarding federalism in India\n\nRegionalism\nIndia is a nation of diversity, where people from different cultural backgrounds reside together. Regionalism is one of the major issues and challenges pertaining to the federal structure.\nRegionalism is where an individual\u2019s region is given preference, at times that of other regions as well.\u00a0 In a country as diverse and geographically vast as India, regionalism tends to rear its ugly head from time to time.\nRegionalism is a significant hindrance that stands in front of federalism.\nSome factors can be cultural as in the example of the Northeast states whose denizens feel that they are not culturally close enough to the rest of the country or the case of the Southern states who feel they are not given their fair share of central funds despite having large states.\nIn such situations, people prefer their state over any other state, giving rise to regionalism. After several years of federal rule, we can still find regionalism in India.\nCentralized Amendment Power\nIn a typical federation, the power of amendment to the Federal Constitution lies on a shared basis between the federation and its units. In India, the power of constitutional amendment lies with the Centre under Article 368 and other provisions.\nAlthough ratification of half of the states is sought in some limited areas, the states in the Indian Union have virtually no power in this critical area of governance.\nFederations worldwide have sought a constitutional mechanism to provide equal representation to all units to prevent the predominant influence of larger units on the smaller units. However, there is no such provision for equal representation of units in the Rajya Sabha in India. The States are not allowed to give opinions over the amendments done to the Constitution of India from time to time.\nEncroachments on States\u2019 Autonomy in State Subjects\nIn recent years, several major and politically sensitive decisions have been made without consultation or reference to the relevant states, such as:\nWithout consulting the state legislature, Article 370 was repealed.\nOverstepping its power and forcing a law on the states, Parliament legislated on \u201cagricultural\u201d in the state list to enact the three disputed farm laws.\nThe New Education Policy 2020 has also been criticized for infringing on the polity\u2019s federal nature.\nIn addition, the BSF\u2019s jurisdiction was expanded without consultation with the respective governments in Assam, West Bengal, and Punjab.\nLanguage Conflicts\nIndia is a land of diversity, and people of different cultures and backgrounds reside in India. Diversity in languages in India sometimes causes a blow to the federal spirit of the Constitution. There are 22 languages constitutionally approved in India. Besides, hundreds of dialects are spoken across the country.\nTrouble arises when the strongest unit of the federation attempts to force a particular language on others. The tussle for the official language in India is still a burning issue.\nThe southern states\u2019 opposition to Hindi as the official language of India has led to a deep-seated language crisis in India.\nEconomic Incompatibilities of the Units\nDifferences in economic standards and relative economic and fiscal incompatibilities among the constituent states also pose a threat to a federation.\nThe forces of imbalances in the field are demands for economic planning and development for regional economic equality and the financial autonomy of states. Demand for financial equality in a region creates problems in a federation.\nIn India, some states are declared as poor and on the principle of equalization, are getting grants-in-aid. However, the dilemma in a federation emerges that if the principle of equalization is adhered to, the national income and the total income growth will suffer.\nProblems with the Tax System\nThe ill-conceived Goods and Services Tax (GST) has already stripped states of most of their sovereignty\u00a0and made the country\u2019s indirect tax framework unitary.\nThe Union government routinely breached the GST regime\u2019s reimbursement commitments to the States during the pandemic. The impact of the economic slump was exacerbated by the failure to pay the States their dues.\n\nRead: Types of taxes in India\n\nDivision Of Powers\nUnlike other federations globally, India\u2019s distribution of power is different and unique. According to the Indian Constitution, the division of powers are made under three list among the Central and State governments.\nThe powers of Central and State governments are mentioned in the Union list and State list, respectively. Whereas, some other powers are vested in the hands of both governments, and it is mentioned in the Concurrent List.\nThe division of power among the Central and State governments is one of the significant issues & challenges to the Federal structure.\nCentralized Planning\nAlthough economic and social planning is found in the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, Still, the Union government still gets unconstrained authority over national and regional decision-making and planning in India.\nCentralized planning, through the Planning Commission, now NITI Aayog appointed by the Centre, considerable preponderance in legislative power for the Union, the financial dependence of the states on the Centre\u2019s mercy, and the administrative inferiority of the states make the states meek and weak.\nThe State governments are dependent on the Central Government for financial aid. The lack of powers in the hands of the State government makes it difficult for federalism in India.\nReligious Issue\nAs stated above, India is a land of diversity, and people belonging to different religions live in India. The religious barrier has become one of the significant issues and challenges pertaining to the federal structure.\nReligious conflicts and intolerance among the people of different religions have become one of the most significant issues & challenges about the federal structure.\nSeveral bodies are ineffective\nThe Planning Commission has been abolished, the\u00a0Inter-State Council has only met once in the last seven years, and the National Development Council has never met.\nCovid-19\u2019s impact\nThe states were limited in their ability to control COVID-19 in areas such as testing kits, immunization, the application of the Disaster Management Act of 2005, and the unplanned nationwide lockdown.\nFurthermore, during the Second Wave, an\u00a0unprepared administration responded to criticism by declaring health to be a \u201cState topic.\u201d\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

It is a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic with a parliamentary system of government.\n\nThe Indian Constitution was approved by the Constituent Assembly on November 26, 1949, and took effect on January 26, 1950. The Indian Constitution provides for a Parliamentary form of government which is federal in structure with certain unitary features.\n\nThe Indian Constitution was amended several times. The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 is known as the \u201cMini Constitution\u201d because it made a large number of changes in the various parts of the Constitution.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEssential Features of the Indian Constitution\nLargest Written Constitution\nSovereign Socialist, Secular, Democratic, and Republic\nParliamentary form of Government\nPartly Rigid and Partly Flexible\nFundamental Rights\nDirective Principles of State Policy\nFundamental Duties\nAdult Suffrage\nAn Independent Judiciary\nA Secular Socialist State\nSingle Citizenship\nThree-Tier Government\nEssential Features of the Indian Constitution\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nImportant features of the constitution are as follows:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nLargest Written Constitution\n\nIt is a written constitution containing as many as 395 Articles, originally divided into 22 parts and 9 schedules. At present, there are 448 articles, 25 parts, and 12 schedules in the Indian Constitution.\n\nIndian Constitution is the largest one in the world. The Constitution\u2019s framers included several features to prevent loopholes and flaws because they wanted to ensure there would be no difficulties throughout its implementation.\nThey framed the Chapter on Fundamental Rights on the model of the American Constitution, the parliamentary system of Government from the United Kingdom, the Directive Principles of State Policy from the Constitution of Ireland, and the Emergency provisions from the Constitution of the German Reich and the Government of India Act, 1935.\nMoreover, it lays down the structure not only of the Central Government but also of the States. Another factor contributing to the Constitution\u2019s bulk is the size of the country and the diversity of the people living there.\nSovereign Socialist, Secular, Democratic, and Republic\n\nAccording to the Preamble, India is a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic.\n\nSovereign: The word Sovereign emphasizes that India is no longer dependent upon any outside authority.\nSocialist: The term \u201cSocialist\u201d has been inserted in the Preamble by the Constitution 42nd Amendment Act, 1976. In general, it means some form of ownership of the means of production and distribution by the State. India has chosen a mixed economy and now drifting towards privatization.\nSecularism: The term Secularism means a State which has no religion of its own as a recognized religion of the State. It treats all religions equally.\nDemocratic: The term \u201cdemocratic\u201d indicates that the Constitution has established a form of Government that gets authority from the will of the people. The rulers are elected by the people. Justice, liberty Equality, and Fraternity are the essential features of democracy.\nRepublic: The term Republic signifies that there shall be an elected head of the State who will be the Chief Executive Head. The President of India, unlike the British King or Queen, is not a hereditary monarch but an elected person chosen for a limited period. It is an essential ingredient of a Republic.\nParliamentary form of Government\n\nBoth at the Centre and States, the Constitution established a parliamentary form of Government.\u00a0 The essence of the parliamentary form of Government is its responsibility to the legislature. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lower House i.e., Lok Sabha, and therefore it is called responsible Government.\n\nParliamentary democracy has three important characteristics namely,\n\nThe executive is responsible to the Lower House;\nThe Lower House has a democratic basis i.e. it is elected by the people; and\nThe ultimate legislative and financial control is vested in this Lower House.\n\nThe Parliamentary system of Government in India is based on adult suffrage, whereby all citizens of India who are not less than 18 years of age and are not disqualified on certain grounds like non-residence, unsoundness of mind or corrupt practices have the right to be registered as voters in any election to the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assemblies of the States.\n\nPartly Rigid and Partly Flexible\n\nOne of the important features of the Indian Constitution is that it is partly rigid and partly flexible.\n\nCertain provisions can be amended by a simple majority in Parliament, while there are certain other provisions whose amendment requires not only a special majority in Parliament but also ratification by at least one-half of the State Legislatures.\nFundamental Rights\n\nFundamental Rights are incorporated in part III of the Indian Constitution. This idea of incorporating the Bill of Rights has been taken from the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThese rights impose limitations on the powers of the State. The State cannot take away or abridge these Fundamental Rights of the citizens guaranteed by the Constitution.\nIf it passes such a law it may be declared unconstitutional by the Courts.\nThe Supreme Court is empowered to grant the most effective remedies like Writs of Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Quo Warranto, and Certiorari whenever these rights are violated.\n\nHowever, the Fundamental Rights are not absolute. They are subjected to certain restrictions, based on some social interests.\n\nDirective Principles of State Policy\n\nThe Directive Principles of State Policy is contained in Part IV of the Constitution. Unlike Fundamental Rights, these rights are not justiciable. Though by their very nature, they are not justiciable in the Court of law.\n\nThe idea of the welfare state envisaged in our Constitution can only be achieved if the States endeavor to implement it with a high sense of moral duty.\nDirective Principles of State Policy support villages and rural economy called Gram Swaraj, one of the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi.\nFundamental Duties\n\nThe provisions of fundamental duties were not provided by the original constitution. It was incorporated by the 42nd Amendment Act, of 1976, as a Code of ten \u201cFundamental Duties\u201d for Citizens. These were added on the recommendation of the Swaran Singh Committee.\n\nThe 86th Amendment Act of 2002 added one more fundamental duty (11th). These duties, like the Directive Principles of State Policy, cannot be judicially enforced. However, they remind the responsible citizens what the Constitution expects from them.\nAdult Suffrage\n\nUnder the Indian Constitution, every man and woman above 18 years of age has been given the right to elect their representatives for the legislature. By the 61st Amendment Act of 1988, the voting age was reduced to 18 years from 21 years in 1989.\n\nThe adoption of universal adult suffrage under Article 326 without any qualification of sex, property, taxation, or the like is a bold experiment in India having regard to the vast extent of the country and its population, with an overwhelming illiteracy.\nAn Independent Judiciary\n\nThe Indian Constitution establishes an integrated as well as an independent judicial system. The Supreme Court stands at the top of the integrated judicial system of the country and below it, there are high courts at the state level.\n\nThe Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal, the guarantor of fundamental rights, and the guardian of the Constitution.\n\nA Secular Socialist State\n\nThe Citizens of our country are free to follow any religion and they enjoy equal rights without any distinction of caste, creed religion, or sex. The word \u201csecular\u201d has been included in the Preamble by the 42nd Amendment.\n\nArticle 15 (1) prohibits any discrimination based on religion, and Article 25 (1) provides that subject to public order, morality, and health and the other provisions, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to profess, practice, and propagate religion.\nSecularism is also subject to democratic socialism. Religious freedom cannot, therefore, be used to practice economic exploitation. The right to acquire, own, and administer property by religious institutions is subject to the regulatory power of the State.\nSingle Citizenship\n\nThough the Constitution envisaged a dual polity i.e., Centre and States, it provides for a single citizenship for the whole of India. The American Constitution provides for dual citizenship i.e., the citizen of the USA and a State citizenship. Every Indian has citizenship throughout the country with the same rights.\n\nThree-Tier Government\n\nOne of the prominent features of the Indian Constitution is the three-tier structure of government. The original Constitution, like all other federal constitutions, established a dual polity and contained laws governing the structure and authority of both the federal government and the states. Later, the third level of government (i.e., local) was added by the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992, which is not found in any other constitution in the world.\n\nThe 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 gave constitutional recognition to the panchayats (rural local governments) by adding a new Part IX and a new Schedule 11 to the Constitution. Similarly, the 74th Amendment Act of 1992 gave constitutional recognition to the municipalities (urban local governments) by adding a new Part IX-A and a new Schedule 12 to the Constitution.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nConstitution of India\nBorrowed features of the Indian Constitution\nIndian Constitution: History and Evolution\nHistorical background of Indian Constitution\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

In crisis settings, women often bear the brunt of violence, marginalization, and economic exclusion.\n\nGender justice seeks to address historical and ongoing disparities and discrimination based on gender, striving for a more just and equal society where all individuals have equal rights, opportunities, and access to resources, regardless of their gender identity or expression.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGender justice\nConstitutional provisions of Gender justice\nLandmark Judgments\nWay forward\nPrevious year question\nGender justice\n\nGender justice emphasizes gender equality, which means that individuals of all genders should have equal rights and opportunities. This includes equal access to education, employment, healthcare, and participation in decision-making processes.\n\nIt opposes discrimination based on gender, including discrimination against women, men, transgender individuals, and gender non-conforming people. Discrimination can take various forms, including unequal pay, gender-based violence, and exclusion from certain roles or positions.\nGender justice promotes the empowerment of individuals, especially women and marginalized genders, by giving them the tools, resources, and support needed to make informed choices, participate in society, and achieve their full potential.\n\nAccess to Justice:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEnsuring that individuals have access to legal remedies and protection against gender-based discrimination and violence is a fundamental aspect of gender justice. This includes efforts to strengthen the legal framework, provide support services, and raise awareness about legal rights.\n\nGender justice seeks to prevent and address gender-based violence, which disproportionately affects women and marginalized genders. It advocates for the enforcement of laws against violence, support for survivors, and efforts to change social norms that perpetuate violence.\n\nEmpowerment and Rights:\n\nPromoting gender equality and challenging harmful stereotypes and biases are essential components of gender justice. Education and awareness campaigns help change societal attitudes and behaviors.\n\nGender justice includes economic empowerment initiatives to reduce gender disparities in income, access to resources, and economic opportunities. This often involves measures to promote women\u2019s participation in the workforce and entrepreneurship.\nEnsuring access to healthcare, including sexual and reproductive health services, is a critical aspect of gender justice. It encompasses issues like family planning, maternal health, and access to contraceptives.\nGender justice advocates for equal participation of individuals of all genders in political and decision-making processes. This includes efforts to increase the representation of women and marginalized genders in elected offices and leadership positions.\n\nGender justice recognizes that individuals experience multiple forms of discrimination and disadvantage based on factors such as race, class, disability, and sexual orientation. It aims to address these intersecting forms of discrimination.\n\nRead:\u00a0Women\u2019s Reservation Bill\n\nConstitutional provisions of Gender justice\n\nIndia has a long history of being one of the most unequal and insensitive to gender issues nations in the world.\n\nThis is especially true for women, who suffer from a range of social issues like infanticide, foeticide, child marriage, and gender biases regarding the ownership of coparcenary property, among others.\n\nEven in the 21st century, when the entire world has become aware of the attraction of feminism, India has been unable to break free from the constraints of antiquated social practices and customs in various regions.\n\nIndia continues to be the most significant country in the patriarchal belt of the world, where women are still viewed as less important than males, in a kin-ordered social structure.\n\nIndian women should be treated equally, and the state should protect them, according to the constitution\u2019s creators.\n\nRight to Equality (Article 14): Article 14 of the Indian Constitution guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the law to all citizens, regardless of their gender. It prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex.\nProhibition of Discrimination (Article 15): Article 15 prohibits discrimination based on sex, among other grounds. It empowers the state to make special provisions for women and children.\nEquality of Opportunity (Article 16): Article 16 ensures equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. It prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex, and the state is authorized to make reservations for women in government jobs.\nProtection of Minorities (Article 29): Article 29 protects the educational and cultural rights of minorities, which includes women belonging to minority communities.\nAbolition of Untouchability (Article 17): Article 17 abolishes \u201cuntouchability\u201d in any form and prohibits its practice. While this provision doesn\u2019t explicitly mention gender, it has a significant impact on the lives of women from marginalized communities.\nDirective Principles of State Policy (DPSP) (Article 39): The DPSP includes principles that guide the state in matters of policy. Article 39(a) emphasizes equal pay for equal work for both men and women.\nRights of Women (Article 42): Article 42 directs the state to make provisions for securing just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief for women.\nReservation of Seats in Panchayats (Article 243D): This article provides for the reservation of seats for women in Panchayats (local self-government institutions) to ensure their participation in grassroots-level governance.\nReservation of Seats in Municipalities (Article 243T): Similar to Article 243D, Article 243T mandates the reservation of seats for women in municipal bodies.\nProtection Against Violence (Article 15(3), Article 46, Article 51A(e)): While these articles do not explicitly mention violence against women, they emphasize the need for the state to protect the rights and dignity of women and to promote a culture that respects the dignity of women.\nRight to Privacy (Article 21): The right to privacy, as established by the Supreme Court of India, includes the right to bodily autonomy. This has important implications for issues such as reproductive rights and the prevention of gender-based violence.\nLandmark Judgments\n\nOver the years, the Indian judiciary has delivered numerous landmark judgments that have advanced gender justice, including judgments related to gender-based violence, workplace harassment, and property rights for women.\n\nVishakha v. State of Rajasthan (1997): This landmark judgment by the Supreme Court of India laid down guidelines to prevent sexual harassment of women in the workplace. These guidelines, known as the Vishakha Guidelines, were an important step toward addressing workplace harassment and creating a safer environment for women employees.\nShayara Bano v. Union of India (2017): This case challenged the practice of triple talaq (instant divorce) in Islamic personal law, which disproportionately affected Muslim women. The Supreme Court declared the practice of triple talaq unconstitutional, recognizing the importance of gender justice in matters of personal laws.\nNavtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018): This historic judgment decriminalized homosexuality in India by striking down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized consensual same-sex relations. The judgment was a significant step toward recognizing the rights and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals, including women.\nSarla Mudgal v. Union of India (1995): In this case, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of bigamy and the practice of Hindu men converting to Islam to marry again without divorcing their Hindu wives. The judgment highlighted the need for legal reforms to protect the rights of women in such cases.\nVineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma (2020): This judgment clarified the legal rights of Hindu daughters in matters of ancestral property. It affirmed that daughters have equal rights as sons in ancestral property, irrespective of whether the father was alive or not at the time of the amendment to the Hindu Succession Act.\nIndependent Thought v. Union of India (2017): This case resulted in the Supreme Court raising the legal age of consent for sexual intercourse from 15 to 18 years, recognizing the need to protect the rights and well-being of girls and prevent child marriages.\nJoseph Shine vs Union of India (2018): This landmark judgment challenged the constitutional validity of Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), an archaic law that criminalized adultery, defining it as a crime committed solely by a man having sexual intercourse with a married woman without her husband\u2019s consent.\nWay forward\n\nGender justice is a multifaceted and ongoing effort to create a more equitable and inclusive society.\n\nAchieving gender justice requires the collaboration of governments, civil society organizations, businesses, and individuals to challenge gender-based discrimination and work toward a world where all individuals can live free from gender-related inequalities and injustices.\n\nSocial, political, and economic equality for women is integral to the achievement of all Millennium Development Goals. Hence, gender justice entails ending the inequalities between women and men that are produced and reproduced in the family, the community, the market, and the state.\n\nSince 2020, UNDP and UN Women have worked together to empower women, support their leadership, and fulfill the promise of justice and human rights for all. In 2022, this partnership evolved into the Gender Justice Platform, a framework for strategic cooperation and upscaled joint initiatives.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ.

These included flags with the charkha (spinning wheel) and various colours.\n\nIndians didn\u2019t truly feel the necessity for a flag until the announcement of Bengal\u2019s division. The leaders designated that day as a day of national mourning.\n\nOn the anniversary of the anti-partition campaign a year later, a flag was raised. Sachindra Prasad Bose created it. The flag was forgotten by most people once the split was reversed.\nWhile in Germany for the 2nd International Socialist Congress, Madam Bhikaji Rustom Cama spoke and waved the flag on the political conflict with the British. Hem Chandra Das was the maker of it.\nYears later, in 1917, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Mrs. Annie Besant also created a flag for the Home Rule Movement.\nIn 1921, Gandhi asked Pingali Venkayya to design a national flag, for Freedom Movement.\n\nBirth of the Tricolor:\n\nThe current design of the Indian flag, featuring three horizontal stripes of saffron, white, and green, with a blue Ashoka Chakra (wheel) in the center, was conceptualized by Pingali Venkayya, an Indian freedom fighter and scholar.\n\nHe presented his design to Mahatma Gandhi in 1921 during the All-India Congress Committee meeting.\n\nThe Indian National Congress officially adopted the tricolor flag on July 22, 1947, just before India gained independence from British rule on August 15, 1947.\n\nFlag code of India\n\nFor convenience, the flag code of India is divided into three parts:\n\nPart I: a general description of the flag\nPart II: display of flag by members of public, and private organizations, educational institutions, etc.\nPart III: the display of the national flag by central and state governments and their organizations and agencies.\n\nGeneral description of the flag\n\nThe National Flag shall be a tri-colour panel made up of three rectangular panels or sub-panels of equal widths.

To resolve disputes, dispute processes are used.\n\nThese methods include negotiation, mediation, conflict resolution, and conciliation.\n\nThe typical non-judicial nature of dispute resolution mechanisms means that they do not take place in a court of law.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDispute redressal- Indian scenario\nA brief history\nDispute redressal mechanisms\nAdministrative Tribunal\nNational Company Law Tribunal\nSingle Tribunal for Inter-State Water Disputes\nInter-State Water Dispute Act provisions (1956)\nNational Green Tribunal\nGram Nyayalaya\nLok Adalat\nArbitration And Conciliation\nArbitration\nMediation\nConciliation\nInstitutional mechanism for dispute redressal\nHuman Rights Commissions\nNational Women for Commission (NWC)\nNational Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC)\nNational Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST)\nDispute redressal- Indian scenario\n\nAccording to Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, no individual shall be deprived of his or her liberty except by the method established by law.

In the past, such mediation was known as \u201cPanchayath,\u201d and it was typically led by someone who was respected and held in greater regard by the villagers.\n\nThe Panchayath was presided over by a member of superior stature, quality, and character known as the Village Headman, who was aided by others from various castes in the area who shared his character or cadre.\n\nThe Panchayath heard the conflict between individuals and families, and the verdict was to be accepted by the disputants. The well-being of the disputants and the preservation of their good relations were the key factors taken into account in such Panchayaths.\n\nAlternative modes of dispute resolution (ADR) emerged by creating facilities for providing dispute settlement through arbitration, conciliation, mediation, and negotiation in developing nations like India that are undergoing significant economic reforms within the framework of the rule of law.\n\nThis reduced the burden on the courts and provided means for expeditious dispute resolution. To address the issues, the GOI has established various dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\nGram Sabha, Nyaya Panchayat, Lok Adalat, Family Court, Counseling Centers, Commission of Inquiry, Tribunal, Consumer Court, and Indian Legislation on ADR are a few of the several procedures established in India.\n\nThe system\u2019s main goals are to increase access to justice, promote mediation as opposed to winner-take-all disputes, boost efficiency, and shorten courtroom delays.\n\nHowever, a strong grievance procedure:\n\ngives all parties a predictable, credible, and transparent procedure, resulting in decisions that are regarded as just, practical, and long-lasting.\ndevelops trust as a crucial element of more extensive community relations operations.\nenables more thorough identification of new problems and patterns, allowing for proactive involvement and corrective action.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll talk about several Dispute Redressal Mechanisms\n\nDispute redressal mechanisms\n\nFollowing are some of the dispute redressal mechanisms relevant in the Indian context.\n\nAdministrative Tribunal\n\nIndia is referred to as a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic in the Preamble of its Constitution. These components, in the opinion of our Constitution\u2019s authors, were necessary to create an equitable society and a government based on welfarism.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of the welfare state phenomenon is the administration of justice and the rule of law.\n\nThe government\u2019s duties have multiplied phenomenally as a result of the acceptance of the welfare ideology, giving the executive incredible authority and boosting legislative productivity. More lawsuits have resulted as a result, as have limitations on people\u2019s freedom and ongoing conflicts between them and the authorities.\n\nPart XIV-A, which consists of Articles 323A and 323B, was introduced into the Indian Constitution by the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976. which ultimately resulted in the creation of administrative tribunals.\nArticle 323A: Establishes administrative tribunals to resolve disagreements and complaints over hiring practices, employment terms for those hired to work in the public sector, and other related issues.\nArticle 323B: Provides for the establishment of Tribunals for the adjudication or prosecution of disputes, complaints, or offenses relating to taxes, foreign exchange, labor disputes, land reforms, urban property ceilings, elections to Parliament and State Legislatures, etc.\nAny law may be passed by Parliament by Article 323A, and State Legislatures may also pass laws by Article 323B if they have the necessary legislative authority.\nNational Company Law Tribunal\n\nThe National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) was established by the Central Government by section 408 of the 2013 Companies Act.\n\nThe National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is a quasi-judicial organization that handles equitable jurisdiction that was formerly handled by the Central Government or the High Court. The Tribunal has the authority to control how it conducts itself.\n\nThe following authorities\u2019 corporate jurisdiction is consolidated with the creation of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT):\n\nCompany Law Board\nBoard for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction.\nThe Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction\nJurisdiction and powers relating to winding up restructuring and other such provisions are vested in the High Courts.\n\nThe Ministry of Corporate Affairs has established eleven benches, including one principal bench, in the initial phase. The President, 16 judicial members, and 9 technical members will serve as the chairs of these benches, which will be located in various places.\n\nSingle Tribunal for Inter-State Water Disputes\n\nWater disputes between states are distinct from other interstate conflicts. Article 262 of the Constitution prohibits the Supreme Court and other courts from having jurisdiction over interstate water issues. Disputes are settled by the Interstate (River) Water Disputes Act of 1956. According to its terms, the conflicts must be decided by special, temporary tribunals.\n\nINTER-STATE WATER DISPUTE ACT PROVISIONS (1956)\nThe Inter-State Water Conflicts Act of 1956 governs disputes over river water between states.\nAccording to the 1956 Act\u2019s present provisions, a tribunal can be established if a state government submits a request to the federal government and the federal government is persuaded of the necessity of the tribunal\u2019s establishment.\nThe key recommendations of \u201cThe Sarkaria Commission\u201d were added to this statute in 2002.\nThe modifications prescribed a one-year setup period for the water disputes tribunal as well as a three-year decision-making period.\nWith the first generation of tribunals established shortly after independence to decide disputes involving the Krishna, Narmada, and Godavari rivers, this system has achieved considerable success.\nBut generally speaking, it has found it difficult to reconcile opposing sides and present fair answers.\nNational Green Tribunal\n\nThe National Green Tribunal was established by the National Green Tribunal Act of 2010 to effectively and promptly handle cases involving environmental protection, and the conservation of forests and other natural resources.\n\nIt also deals with the enforcement of any environmental legal rights and the provision of relief and compensation for environmental damages to people and property, as well as for matters related to or incidental to those cases.\nIt is an expert body with the knowledge needed to handle environmental disputes involving many disciplinary issues.\n\nMajor features\n\nThe Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is not a requirement for the NGT to follow; instead, it will act by natural justice principles.\nThe Indian Evidence Act, of 1872\u2019s rules of evidence are not binding on NGT either.\nConservation groups will find it easier to present facts and issues before the NGT (as opposed to going before a court), including pointing out technical problems with a project or suggesting alternatives that could lessen environmental damage but have not been examined.\nThe NGT will use the precautionary principle, the polluter pays principle, and the principles of sustainable development when passing orders, decisions, and awards. However, it should be noted that the NGT has the authority to impose fees, including lost benefits as a result of any temporary injunction if it determines that a claim is untrue.\nGram Nyayalaya\n\nUnquestionably, the idea of a contemporary, democratic, and constitutional India revolves around equality and justice. By conducting its job of administering justice, the State machinery carries out the values of equality and fairness. Systemic issues with India\u2019s judicial system include corruption, holdups, pendency, rising prices, a lack of adequate legal aid, and a shortage of judges and attorneys with the necessary training.\n\nTo address these issues, the Law Ministry established Gram Nyayalays in 2009 to give the underprivileged living in villages a low-cost venue to resolve legal disputes. The Gram Nyayalayas Act of 2008 created it.\nThis Act perpetuates the phenomenon of two distinct groups of Indians: the wealthy urban citizen who can afford and access the courts, and the less connected rural citizen who has access to forums that are primarily focused on resolving their claims without the application of crucial procedural safeguards such as attorneys, appeals, protections for procedural rights, and evidentiary requirements.\nGram Nyayalayas are mobile village courts that were created in India to provide quick and simple access to the legal system in the country\u2019s rural areas.\nThey are designed to bring affordable justice to rural residents at their doorsteps.\nThe Act went into effect on October 2, 2009, Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s birthday. (The symbols Gram, Nyay, and Aalya represent the village, justice, and house, respectively.)\nLok Adalat\n\nEffective justice delivery is a perennial requirement of peace, order, civilization, and national governance under any form of government.\n\nIt is the primary responsibility of the State to ensure that everyone receives equal and impartial justice by regulating how citizens interact with one another, preventing disorder and favoritism of one class of people over others, and upholding all fundamental rights necessary for the existence and advancement of the average person by establishing an efficient justice system.\n\nHowever, in practice, the promise of equality before the law does not satisfy a poor man since he lacks access to justice. Other factors that negatively impacted the administration of justice were delays, corruption, expensive litigation, access issues, a dearth of courts, judges, and government employees, a drawn-out procedure, and a lack of legal aid and legal education for the poor.\n\nLok Adalat has been founded as a result of these flaws in the current legal system.\n\nLegislations related to Lok Adalat:\n\nBy the constitutional requirement in Article 39-A of the Constitution of India, which incorporates several provisions for dispute settlement through Lok Adalat, the National Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 provided Lok Adalats a statutory character.\nTo ensure that no citizen is denied the opportunity to secure justice due to economic hardship or other disabilities, this Act establishes legal services authorities to provide competent and free legal services to the most vulnerable members of society.\nIt also establishes Lok Adalats to ensure that the functioning of the legal system promotes justice on an equal opportunity basis.\nArbitration And Conciliation\nARBITRATION\n\nIn the arbitration procedure, a decision is made on the merits of the case by a neutral third party or parties. In the Indian setting, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1998 broadly defines the rules for the arbitration process, and the parties are free to devise an arbitration process that is appropriate and pertinent to their disputes in the areas covered by the Statute.\n\nMEDIATION\n\nThe mediation process seeks to make it easier for the conflicting parties to come to a mutually agreeable settlement. The Mediator is a neutral third party who oversees the mediation process. The ability of the mediator to help the parties\u2019 negotiations depends on their agreement.\n\nCONCILIATION\n\nA less formal variation of arbitration is conciliation. No prior agreement is necessary for this method to work. Any party may request the appointment of a conciliator from the opposite party. Two or three conciliators are permitted but one is recommended. If there are numerous conciliators, they must all work together. There can be no conciliation if a party declines an offer to do so.\n\nThe conciliator may receive statements from the parties outlining the overall nature of the dispute and the items in contention. A copy of the statement is sent from one side to the other.\nThe conciliator has the right to ask for more information, request a meeting with the parties, and initiate verbal or written correspondence with them. The conciliator may even get proposals from the parties for resolving the conflict.\nWhen the conciliator believes that a settlement has some of the necessary components, he may draft the terms of the agreement and send them to the parties for their approval. The settlement agreement will be final and binding after both parties have signed it.\n\nAlso read: Alternative dispute resolution\n\nInstitutional mechanism for dispute redressal\nHuman Rights Commissions\n\nIn 1994, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established as a result of the 1993 Protection of Human Rights Act. It noted that \u201cincreasing concern about issues linked to human rights\u201d had been expressed both domestically and internationally.\n\nIt had been deemed necessary to review the current rules and processes as well as the administrative structure to increase efficiency and transparency in light of this as well as the shifting social realities and new trends in crime and violence.\n\nThe Human Rights Protection Act of 1993 makes it possible for the State Government to establish a State Human Rights Commission to exercise the authority granted to it and carry out the duties specified in the Act.\n\nNational Women for Commission (NWC)\n\nThe National Commission for Women was established as a statutory body in January 1992 with the charge of reviewing the constitutional and legal protections for women, suggesting corrective legislative measures, assisting with grievance redress, and advising the government on all policy issues affecting women.\n\nThe Commission has all the authority of a Civil Court hearing a case to carry out these duties, as is the case with the NCSC/NCST.\n\nThe Union Government arranges for the Commission\u2019s reports on the operation of the protections for women to be presented to each House of Parliament, along with an update on any actions taken in response to the Commission\u2019s recommendations and any explanations for any rejections, if any.\n\nWhen it comes to concerns involving a State Government, the report and accompanying Action Taken Report are presented to the State Legislature.\n\nNational Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC)\n\nThere used to be a Special Office for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under Article 338 of the Constitution. The Office of Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was given this title. A multi-member Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was established in 1978 as a result of the 46th Amendment.\n\nBy the Constitution (Eighty-ninth Amendment) Act of 2003, separate commissions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were to be established. As a result, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) was established for the first time in 2004.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s responsibility is to provide the President with annual and special reports. These Reports include suggestions for actions that the Union and State Governments should take to effectively implement the safeguards and other welfare measures.\n\nThese Reports must be presented to both Houses of Parliament along with a Memorandum outlining the course of action taken or being considered by each Ministry or Department and any grounds for rejection, if any. If the suggestions apply to state governments, a comparable Memorandum containing the recommendations must be presented to the appropriate state legislatures.\n\nNational Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST)\n\nThe NCSC and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes both had similar beginnings. It was established as a separate Commission in 2004 as a result of the Constitution (Eighty-ninth Amendment Act, 2003), which added Article 338A and amended Article 107.\n\nBefore that, as was already indicated, a single organization was in charge of overseeing the constitutional protections offered to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\nThe National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) shares several characteristics with the NCSC, including its composition, terms, powers, and reporting mechanism. Scheduled Tribes receive the same constitutional protections and legal protections as SCs.\n\nSix units make up the NCST and they are responsible for administration, coordination, socioeconomic and educational development, service safeguards, and atrocities-related issues. The NCST has six regional offices that give it a regional perspective.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Grievance redressal mechanism\n\nArticle written by: Caroline"

The primary aim of the bill is to enhance women\u2019s political representation and participation in decision-making processes at the highest levels of government. Read here to learn the latest developments.\n\nIndian Parliament passed the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill on September 18, 2023. It is a landmark moment for gender equality, especially in terms of women\u2019s political leadership.\n\nThe passage of the bill is testimony to India\u2019s commitment to women-led development, for which it mobilized global support during its G20 Presidency in 2023.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Women\u2019s Reservation Bill 2023\nWomen\u2019s Reservation Bill: History\nObjectives of the Bill\nCriticism of the bill\nSignificance of the bill\nConclusion\nPrevious year question\nThe Women\u2019s Reservation Bill 2023\n\nThe Women\u2019s Reservation Bill 2023, officially titled The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Eighth Amendment) Bill 2023, was introduced in the Parliament of India, marking a significant moment in the legislative arena.\n\nThe current legislation aims to reserve 33 per cent of seats in both the directly elected Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies exclusively for women.\n\nIt was historic as being the first bill considered in the newly inaugurated parliament building.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe women\u2019s reservation would be implemented following the first delimitation, which is currently on hold until 2026.\n\nWomen\u2019s Reservation Bill: History\n\nThe bill has its roots in the recommendations of various committees and commissions, including the National Commission for Women and the United Nations, which have advocated for increased women\u2019s participation in politics.\n\nThe bill was first introduced in Parliament in the 1990s but has faced numerous challenges in the legislative process.\n\nOver the years, the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill has been introduced in Parliament multiple times but has not been passed into law. It has lapsed or been deferred several times due to political disagreements and resistance.\n\nThe bill has faced opposition from various quarters, including some political parties and lawmakers.\n\nCritics have raised concerns about its implementation, its potential impact on other marginalized groups, and whether it addresses the broader issue of women\u2019s empowerment beyond political representation.\nDespite its challenges, the bill has received support from women\u2019s rights activists, civil society organizations, and many women politicians. They argue that it is a necessary step to break down gender barriers in Indian politics.\nSupporters of the bill iterate that it will help address gender disparities in political representation and empower women to actively participate in policy formulation and decision-making. It is seen as a step toward achieving gender equality in politics.\n\nSome states in India have taken independent measures to increase women\u2019s representation in local governance. For example, several states have introduced a quota system to reserve seats for women in panchayats (local self-government bodies).\n\nObjectives of the Bill\n\nThe proposed bill calls for the reservation of one-third (33.33%) of the total seats in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies for women.\n\nIt mandates 33 percent reservation for women in the Lok Sabha, the state Legislative Assemblies, and the Delhi Assembly.\nIt also reserves one-third of seats for women within the existing SC and ST reservations.\nSeats will be reserved on a rotational basis, and reservations will cease after 15 years.\nCriticism of the bill\n\nTwo reasons call for criticism of the 2023 Bill.\n\nFirst, the implementation schedule\u2019s complexity. The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Amendment) Act of 2023 would go into effect once \u201can exercise of delimitation is undertaken for this purpose after the relevant figures for the first Census taken after that date have been published,\u201d according to the bill. The election cycle from which women will get their fair share is not specified.\nSecond, the new Bill does not offer women\u2019s reservation in the Rajya Sabha and state legislative councils, in keeping with the previous regimes. Women are currently underrepresented in the Rajya Sabha compared to the Lok Sabha. The Lower and Upper Houses must both adhere to the concept of representation.\n\nPreviously, numerous critical arguments against the reservation for women in politics had surfaced-\n\nSome argue that reservation policies can lead to tokenism, where women are seen as filling quotas rather than being genuinely supported and empowered.\nThere can be resistance and backlash against women in leadership roles, which may not necessarily dismantle entrenched patriarchy.\nReservation policies typically apply to political representation but may not address broader societal and cultural norms that perpetuate patriarchy.\nThe effectiveness of reservation policies may vary for women of different social, economic, and cultural backgrounds. Intersectionality\u2014the overlapping of multiple forms of discrimination\u2014needs to be considered.\nReservation policies may be a starting point, but achieving lasting change in gender equality requires addressing systemic issues beyond political representation.\nSignificance of the bill\n\nThe significance of the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill in India is multifaceted and has far-reaching implications:\n\nUnder Representation of Women in Legislature: Globally, women currently occupy only 26.7% of parliamentary seats and 35.5% of local government positions. Such a step by India, a large economy can have a positive impact globally as well.\nGender Equality and Empowerment: The primary objective of the bill is to promote gender equality and empower women by providing them with adequate political representation. Women constitute nearly half of India\u2019s population, and ensuring their participation in decision-making processes is a fundamental aspect of gender justice.\nPolitical Participation: The bill aims to increase the political participation of women at all levels of government. By reserving seats for women, it encourages women to enter politics, contest elections, and hold public office.\nWomen\u2019s Voices and Issues: Increased representation of women in legislatures ensures that women\u2019s voices are heard on critical issues, including those related to women\u2019s rights, education, health, and safety. It can lead to policies and legislation that address gender-based discrimination and violence.\nWomen elected to political office can serve as role models for other women and girls, inspiring them to pursue leadership roles in various fields, including politics.\nTackling Patriarchy: The reservation\u00a0of seats for women challenges traditional gender roles and stereotypes, challenging the patriarchal nature of Indian politics and society.\nGender Inclusive Governance: Research has shown that gender diversity in decision-making bodies, including legislatures, often leads to better governance and decision-making, as diverse perspectives and experiences are considered.\nSocial and Economic Development: Empowering women politically can have positive effects on social and economic development. It can lead to policies that promote gender-sensitive development, improved access to education and healthcare for women, and increased economic opportunities.\nAddressing Gender Disparities: The bill can contribute to reducing gender disparities in various sectors, including education, employment, and healthcare, as women\u2019s concerns and priorities are more likely to be addressed.\nInternational Commitments: India is a signatory to international agreements and conventions that call for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Implementing the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill demonstrates India\u2019s commitment to these international obligations.\nThe bill encourages political parties to promote women leaders and give them opportunities to contest elections, which can lead to a more inclusive and diverse political landscape.\n\nRelated articles: Women in Politics, Women in Judiciary, Women in Armed Forces, Women in STEM\n\nConclusion\n\nAccording to the United Nations, \u201cThis quota reserving 33% seats for women will leapfrog India into one of 64 countries around the world who have reserved seats for women in their national Parliaments. Typically, achieving a critical mass of 30 percent representation by women in Parliament is known to yield positive outcomes for women\u2019s empowerment. However, we hope that implementing such reservations will ultimately lead to achieving 50 percent representation of women in Parliaments across the globe.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill has faced opposition and debates within India\u2019s political landscape.\n\nSome critics argue that it might perpetuate tokenism, while others believe that it is necessary to address the underrepresentation of women in politics.\n\nReservation for women in politics can be a valuable tool in challenging patriarchy and promoting gender equality, but it should be part of a broader strategy that addresses cultural norms, education, economic empowerment, and social change to create a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of such policies can vary, and their success depends on various factors, including their design and implementation.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ. \u201cThe reservation of seats for women in the institutions of local self-government has had a limited impact on the patriarchal character of the Indian Political Process.\u201d Comment.

The process of framing the Constitution began in the 1930s, with the formation of the Indian National Congress and the demand for self-governance.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDuring the freedom movement, various constitutional frameworks were proposed, including the Nehru Report of 1928, the Karachi Resolution of 1931, and the Bombay Plan of 1944. These proposals formed the basis for the Constituent Assembly, which was elected in 1946 to draft a new Constitution for the newly independent nation.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly was composed of elected representatives from all the provinces of British India, as well as representatives from the princely states. It was chaired by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, who played a key role in the drafting of the Constitution.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly held its first meeting on 9 December 1946, and over the next three years, it debated and discussed the various provisions of the Constitution. The Constitution was finally adopted on 26 November 1949, and it came into effect on 26 January 1950, marking the birth of the Republic of India.\n\nThe Constitution of India reflects the country\u2019s diverse culture and the values of its founding fathers, who were inspired by the ideals of democracy, justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.

The process of amending the Constitution is set out in Article 368, which requires a special majority in both houses of Parliament, as well as the ratification of at least half of the states in the country.\n\nThe Constitution has been amended more than 100 times since its adoption. The amendments have been made to reflect the changing needs and aspirations of the country, as well as to incorporate new laws and policies.\n\nSome of the significant amendments to the Constitution include:\n\nThe First Amendment Act of 1951, amended the freedom of speech and expression and added the Ninth Schedule to protect certain laws from judicial review.\nThe Seventh Amendment Act of 1956, reorganized the states of India on linguistic lines.\nThe Ninth Amendment Act of 1960, recognized the right to property as a fundamental right.\nThe Twenty-Fourth Amendment Act of 1971, abolished the privy purse and abolished the privy council as a court of appeal for the princely states.\nThe Thirty-Ninth Amendment Act of 1975, recognized Sikkim as a state of India.\nThe Forty-Second Amendment Act of 1976, amended several provisions of the Constitution, including the Preamble, and added the words \u201csecular\u201d and \u201csocialist\u201d to it.\nThe Seventy-Third Amendment Act of 1992, recognized the rights of the scheduled castes and tribes to participate in local self-governance.\nThe Ninety-Fourth Amendment Act of 2006, provided reservations for the scheduled castes and tribes in the promotion to higher posts in the civil services.\n\nThe Constitution of India has played a vital role in shaping the country\u2019s political and social landscape, and it continues to evolve to meet the changing needs of the nation.\n\nIndian Constitution: Features\n\nThe Constitution of India has several features that set it apart from the constitutions of other countries. Some of the key features of the Indian Constitution are:\n\nWritten and comprehensive: The Constitution of India is a written document that sets out the framework for the country\u2019s political system and the rights and duties of its citizens. It is the longest-written constitution of any sovereign country in the world, with 444 articles in 22 parts and 12 schedules.\nFederal system: The Constitution of India establishes a federal system of government, in which power is divided between the central government and the states. The central government has exclusive powers in certain areas, such as foreign affairs and defense, while the states have powers in matters such as education and law and order.\nParliamentary democracy: The Constitution of India establishes a parliamentary form of government, in which the executive is responsible to the legislature. The President of India is the head of state, while the Prime Minister is the head of government.\nFundamental rights: The Constitution of India guarantees a set of fundamental rights to all citizens, which include the right to equality, freedom of speech and expression, and the protection of life and personal liberty. These rights are enforceable by the courts, and any law that violates these rights can be struck down by the courts.\nDirective principles: The Constitution of India also lays down a set of directive principles of state policy, which are non-enforceable guidelines for the government to follow in the formulation of its policies. These principles include the promotion of international peace and security, the protection of the environment, and the promotion of the welfare of the people.\nIndependent judiciary: The Constitution of India establishes an independent judiciary, which is responsible for interpreting the laws of the country and upholding the rights of citizens. The Supreme Court is the highest in the country, and it has the power of judicial review, which allows it to declare a law or government action unconstitutional.\nAmendment process: The Constitution of India provides a detailed process for amending its provisions. An amendment requires a special majority in both houses of Parliament, as well as the ratification of at least half of the states in the country. This ensures that any changes to the Constitution are made with the consensus of the majority of the people.\nIndian Constitution: Amendments\n\nThe process of amending the Constitution of India is set out in Article 368 of the Constitution. According to this article, an amendment to the Constitution can be initiated by the introduction of a bill in either house of Parliament.\n\nThe bill must be passed by a special majority in both houses of Parliament, which means that it must be supported by at least two-thirds of the members present and voting in each house.\n\nOnce the bill is passed by Parliament, it must be ratified by at least half of the states in the country. The ratification must be done by the state legislatures, and it must be obtained within six months from the date of the passing of the bill.\n\nIf the bill is ratified by at least half of the states, it becomes an act and is added to the Constitution as an amendment. If the bill is not ratified by the required number of states, it lapses and cannot be reintroduced in Parliament.\n\nThe process of amending the Constitution of India is designed to ensure that any changes to the Constitution are made with the consensus of the majority of the people. The special majority requirement in Parliament and the ratification by the states ensure that the amendment has the support of a wide cross-section of the country.\n\nAlso read: Amendments of Indian Constitution\n\nSignificant Provisions of the Indian Constitution\n\nThe Indian Constitution is a comprehensive document that outlines the rights and duties of citizens, as well as the structure and functions of the government.

This doctrine was propounded by the Supreme Court of India in the landmark case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala in 1973.\n\nThe basic structure doctrine has not been explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India. Rather, it has been inferred by the Supreme Court from the provisions of the Constitution and the principles underlying it. According to this doctrine, the following are the basic features of the Constitution that cannot be amended:\n\nSupremacy of the Constitution\nRepublican and democratic form of government\nSecular Character of the Constitution\nSeparation of powers between the legislature, executive, and judiciary\nFederal character of the Constitution\nFree and fair elections\nIndependence of the judiciary\nJudicial review\nThe principle of equality before the law and prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, gender, or place of birth.\n\nThe basic structure doctrine has been instrumental in protecting the fundamental rights of citizens and preserving the basic tenets of the Constitution. It has also served as a check on the powers of the Parliament to amend the Constitution, ensuring that any amendments are consistent with the basic principles and values of the Constitution.\n\nAlso read: Basic Structure of Indian Constitution\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Constitution of India is the supreme law of the land and the foundation of the Indian democratic system. It outlines the powers and functions of the various organs of the government and guarantees the fundamental rights of citizens. The Constitution also contains provisions for the protection of the country\u2019s cultural and linguistic diversity and the promotion of social justice.\n\nThe basic structure doctrine is a key principle of the Constitution which holds that certain fundamental features of the Constitution, such as the supremacy of the Constitution, the republican and democratic form of government, and the secular character of the state, cannot be amended by the Parliament.\n\nThis doctrine has played a crucial role in protecting the fundamental rights of citizens and preserving the basic tenets of the Constitution.\n\nOverall, the Constitution of India serves as a model for other countries around the world and has played a vital role in the country\u2019s development and progress over the past seven decades.

This model divides the state into branches, each with its independent authorities and domains of authority, ensuring that the authority of one branch does not conflict with that of the other branches.\n\nThe French philosopher Montesquieu advanced the Separation of Power doctrine.\nThe basic philosophy behind the theory of separation of power is that there be no concentration of Government power in a single authority.\nThe French Revolution taught us that one individual with unchecked power might wreak devastation.\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, French philosopher Justice Bodin and British politician Locke both published their opinions on this topic.\nSeparation of powers was first included in a national constitution by the United States.\nThe Constitution\u2019s creators thought it was too late to incorporate the Separation of Powers idea because it had already been drafted.\nIndia developed a parliamentary system of governance as well. They, therefore, determined it would be wise to steer clear of adopting the American model of complete division of powers.\n\nTypically, there are three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial. In a parliamentary system where the executive and legislative are combined, it can be distinguished by the merging of the two branches of government.\n\nFor the benefit of individual freedom, the Theory of Separation of Powers is based on the notion and idea.\n\nAlso read: Indian Federalism \u2013 15 Issues that Challenge the Federal Structure of India\n\nThe doctrine of separation of powers\n\nAccording to the doctrine of separation of powers, the three branches of government should be kept apart from one another.\n\nEach department should be given a distinct group of employees with autonomous jurisdictions over the others and restrictions on their operations.\nNo government entity should release any duties that it is not required to. According to the principle, each branch of government must be limited to performing just its duties and cannot interfere with those of other branches.\n\nA single set of people won\u2019t be able to control the state\u2019s machinery because each branch will act as a check on the others.\n\nAccording to the doctrine of separation of powers:\n\nNo person should hold more than one position within any of the three branches of the government.\nThere should be no interference from that one government organ with any other government organs.\nThe duties delegated to any other organ of government should not be performed by that one organ. This is the older, less modern interpretation of the doctrine of the division of powers. Because the economy was so simplistic back then when these researchers and theorists first presented their theories, a new concept of separation of powers emerged.\n\nThe doctrine\u2019s primary goal is to stop the abuse of power in various areas of government. Public power is regulated by the constitution in our constitutional democracy. Each branch of government should stay within its purview.\n\nOur constitution is ultimately protected by the courts, who have a responsibility to uphold it whenever it is misunderstood.\n\nThe courts are more likely to wrestle with the decision of whether to enter the purview of other parts of government while carrying out their constitutionally mandated duties, according to Moseneke CJ.\n\nThe courts have a responsibility to guarantee that the other arms of government execute their authority in a manner consistent with the Constitution within the framework of the theory of separation of powers.\n\nConcept of the separation of powers\nThe trias politica theory serves as the foundation for the separation of powers. By requiring the consent of all three branches when creating, enforcing, and managing laws, it lessens the likelihood of arbitrary government actions.\nThe doctrine of the separation of powers primarily refers to three formulations of governmental powers; one individual should not serve in more than one capacity within any one of the three branches of government.\nAny interference from one governmental organ with another is improper.\nIt is improper for one organ to perform the duties allocated to another.\nConstitutional Provisions on the Separation of Powers\nOur Constitution does not contain any specific clauses addressing the doctrine of separation of powers. However, the Constitution has a few guiding principles:\nThere is no formal or established division of powers outside of what is stated in Article 50 of our constitution, which states that \u201cthe state shall take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive in the public services of the state.\u201d\nThe executive authority of the Union and the State shall be vested in the President and the Governor, who are exempt from civil and criminal liability under Articles 53 and 143.\nArticles 121 and 211: Judicial behavior of a Supreme Court and High Court judge. Articles 121 and 211 prohibit discussion of the judicial actions of Supreme Court and High Court judges in the Parliament and State Legislature.\nArticles 122 and 212: No court may challenge the legality of legislative or parliamentary proceedings.\nAccording to Article 361 of the Constitution, neither the President nor the Governor is subject to legal accountability for how they carry out their official responsibilities.\nSeparation of powers between various organs\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that there are three main categories of governmental functions-\n\nLegislative\nExecutive\nJudicial\n\nLikewise, there are three main organs of the Government in a State:\n\nLegislature\nExecutive\nJudiciary\nThe Legislature\n\nAccording to the Indian Constitution, the legislature is held in high regard. It is mostly connected to the adoption of general laws that apply to all facets of how its citizens and institutions behave.\n\nParliament: The Indian Parliament is a bicameral legislature consisting of two houses: the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the Lok Sabha (House of the People).\n\nRajya Sabha: Members of the Rajya Sabha are not directly elected by the people but are appointed by the President on the advice of the state legislatures. It represents the states and serves as the upper house of Parliament.\nLok Sabha: Members of the Lok Sabha are directly elected by the people of India through general elections. It represents the people and serves as the lower house of Parliament.\n\nState Legislatures: India also has state legislatures in each of its states and union territories, each with its legislative assembly and council (if applicable). These legislatures have the power to make laws on state subjects.\n\nThe Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha are two of India\u2019s Parliament\u2019s two legislative houses.\n\nIt can start investigations, notably against the executive branch, choose the heads of the executive branch, impose taxes, authorize borrowing, draught and administer the budget, and ratify treaties.\nIt also has the only authority to declare war. It can represent the will of the people by preserving an authentic and full democracy.\n\nGiven that it protects a real and complete democracy and represents the will of the people, it can be assumed that the Legislature alone cannot carry out this function entirely. If the nation\u2019s chief financial officer is given total power, democracy is in imminent danger.\n\nThe Constitution protects a proper system of checks and balances to the doctrine of separation of powers by making the executive answerable to the popular house.\n\nOther facades throughout the overall system can support the same goal. As a result, the two other pillars\u2014the judiciary and the Executive\u2014become important.\n\nThe Judiciary\n\nThe Indian constitution was written with such precision that it calls for an impartial, independent judiciary to interpret the document and protect citizens\u2019 rights through judicial review. As a result, the judiciary is required to interpret laws rather than create them.\n\nSupreme Court: The Supreme Court of India is the apex court in the country and is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and ensuring its enforcement. It has the power of judicial review, allowing it to review and strike down laws and executive actions that are found to be unconstitutional.\nHigh Courts: Each state in India has its High Court, which has jurisdiction over the state. High Courts primarily hear cases related to state laws, but they also handle cases involving fundamental rights and constitutional matters.\nLower Courts: Below the High Courts are various subordinate or lower courts, including district courts, which handle civil and criminal cases at the district level.\n\nThey are not to set forth the government\u2019s broad standards of conduct. A crucial component of the government is the judiciary (Harihar Bhattacharyya, 2015).\n\nOne of the most powerful courts in the world is the Supreme Court of India. The judiciary has been essential in interpreting and upholding the Constitution since 1950.\nThe controversy regarding the higher court\u2019s role in hearing and considering public-interest petitions has centered on India\u2019s Supreme Court, particularly.\n\nThe judiciary gives the government various directives in deciding these petitions, including the drafting of laws in many different areas. The judiciary\u2019s duty should be strictly limited to vetting the laws\u2019 constitutionality and not to ordering the government to pass legislation.\n\nA law or executive action is only subject to judicial review if it is within the purview of the legislature, or the executive branch, or if it is by the fundamental rights protected by the Constitution and other mandatory laws.\n\nThe other branches of the government, such as the executive and legislative, must not obstruct the judiciary\u2019s ability to carry out its duties. This is what is meant by the judiciary\u2019s independence.\n\nThe other branches of the government shouldn\u2019t meddle with a court\u2019s ruling.\n\nJudges must be able to carry out their duties impartially.\n\nExecutive\n\nThe Executive has the authority to appoint judges, veto laws, command the military, issue legal regulations and executive orders, make judgments or declarations, and refuse to spend money set aside for specific uses.\n\nPresident: The President of India is the ceremonial head of state and the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Armed Forces. However, the President\u2019s powers are mostly limited to constitutional and ceremonial roles. The President appoints the Prime Minister and other high officials and represents India in diplomatic matters.\nPrime Minister: The Prime Minister is the head of government and holds the highest executive authority. The Prime Minister is typically the leader of the political party or coalition with a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament) and is responsible for running the government, formulating policies, and making most executive decisions.\nCouncil of Ministers: The Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, is responsible for implementing government policies and decisions. Ministers are typically members of Parliament and are responsible for various ministries and departments.\nBureaucracy: The civil services, including the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS), are responsible for implementing government policies and decisions. Bureaucrats are career civil servants who work under the direction of political leaders.\n\nIt also has the authority to pardon criminals who have been found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe Executive is a steadfast ally of democracy and is similarly anticipated to be free from interference from the other two constitutional entities.\n\nAlthough it has been proven that the Executive is separate from the other two, the contradiction still exists. In real usage, it is lost. The reason is that the judiciary and legislature regularly challenge the executive\u2019s decisions. The Executive\u2019s independence is severely weakened as a result.\n\nThe issue of duty does not simply arise in the context of executives. Although the legislative and judiciary are both accountable, there is a structure built into each of them for carrying out those duties. This is the actual situation as it is in the real world.\n\nAlthough the Indian Constitution grants the President and Governors executive powers (Articles 53 (1) and 154 (1), respectively), it also grants them certain legislative powers (Articles 123, 213 and 356) and certain judicial powers (Articles 103 and 192).\n\nSimilarly, the judiciary only performs a limited number of legislative and executive responsibilities, while the legislature performs some judicial functions (Articles 105 and 194) (Articles 145, 146, 227, and 229)\n\nHowever, in the State\u2019s public services, the judicial and executive are kept separate (Article 50). Legislation has been used in certain states to completely separate the judiciary and executive branches.\n\nAccording to Articles 52 and 53 of the Indian constitution:\n\n52. The President of India \u2013 There shall be a President of India.\n53. Executive power of the Union. \u2013 (1) The executive power of the Union shall be vested in the President and shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate to him by this Constitution.\n(3) Nothing in this article shall-(a) be deemed to transfer to the President any functions conferred by any existing law on the Government of any State or other authority, or (b) prevent Parliament from conferring by law functions on authorities other than the President.\nEXECUTIVE AUTHORITY\n\nHe is the person who signs off on all executive decisions made by the Union administration. On the advice of the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India, and the judges of the Supreme Court and High Court, he appoints members of the Union Government, the Prime Minister, and the Council of Ministers.\n\nHe names the Attorney General of India, the Chief Election Commissioner, other Election Commissioners, the Chairman of the UPSC, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the State Governors, members of the Finance Commission, and ambassadors.\n\nPresident of India \u2013 Discretionary Powers You Never Knew Existed! \u2013 Clear IAS\n\nChecks and balances on the principle of separation of powers\nThe Indian Constitution is founded on the concept of \u201cchecks and balances\u201d rather than the strict division of powers.\nTo prevent any one organ from becoming overly dominant, there are checks and balances in place. The Constitution ensures that any organ\u2019s discretionary authority is used democratically.\nThe judiciary has the authority to scrutinize executive and legislative actions.\nParliament passed a bill in 1972 to implement Article 50, taking away the judicial authority previously held by the executive magistrate and transferring it to the judicial magistrate.\nThe Indian Constitution\u2019s Doctrine of Checks and Balance was introduced by the Supreme Court in the 1993 decision of P. Kannadasan v. Tamil Nadu State.\nBy Article 13, if a statute is arbitrary or unconstitutional, the judiciary has the authority to invalidate it.\nAdditionally, it has the authority to deem unconstitutional presidential actions void.\nThe legislature also assesses the performance of the executive.\nEven though the judiciary is autonomous, the executive appoints the judges.\nJudicial Decisions Regarding The Separation Of Powers\n\nBecause we follow a separation of functions rather than a separation of powers in India, we don\u2019t adhere to the notion in its strictest form.\n\nAlthough the notion of the separation of powers is not expressly established in the Constitution, the court found that it is broken when one organ of government fulfills the duties of another in the case of Ram Jawaya v. The State of Punjab.\nTherefore, it is plausible to conclude that our constitution does not contemplate the assumption of functions that fundamentally belong to other bodies of government, even though the Indian Constitution did not recognize the theory of separation of powers in its full rigor.\nIn I.C. Golak Nath v. State of Punjab, the Supreme Court asserted that the Ninth Schedule breaches the Kesavananda Bharati notion of fundamental structure. As a result, the Ninth Schedule was made subject to judicial review, which is another aspect of the basic structure theory. If a statute is unconstitutional under the terms of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has the authority to declare it void.\nIn the case of Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain, the court concluded that our Constitution broadly embraces the doctrine of separation of powers. In contrast to the United States and Australia, India does not adhere to a strict definition of the separation of powers.\nThe Supreme Court was asked to decide in the Kesavananda Bharti Case of 1973 how much the legislature might alter the Constitution by the Constitution\u2019s provisions.\n\nAlso Read: Important Judgements\n\nConclusion\n\nThe principle of separation of powers between various organs ensures that each branch of government operates independently within its defined sphere of authority.\n\nHowever, there are mechanisms for cooperation and checks and balances between these branches to prevent the abuse of power.\n\nFor example, the Executive is accountable to the Legislature, and the Judiciary has the authority to review and strike down unconstitutional actions by the other branches. This system of governance is designed to protect the rights and freedoms of the Indian people and maintain the rule of law.\n\nA democratic government and diverse people like India cannot function under a constitution with a strict separation of powers between various organs.\n\nHowever, the three pillars of government can cooperate democratically thanks to deliberate and moderate constitutional functional overlaps.\n\nBy bridging the gap between the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of government, mutual collaboration improves the efficiency of government. A democracy cannot function well without adhering to the doctrine of separation of powers.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

The Governor serves as the official leader of the State Executive, while the Chief Minister leads the Council of Ministers and is the state\u2019s attorney general.\n\nThe legislature, the executive branch, and the judiciary make up the three branches of the government, which is built on the separation of powers.

The Government of India Act of 1935, which was implemented, established a single system of courts to uphold both federal and state laws.\n\nSupreme Court of India\n\nThe Supreme Court and the High Court are at the top and bottom, respectively, of an integrated legal system established by the Indian constitution. There is a system of inferior courts below the HC.\n\nThe Government of India Act of 1935, which was implemented, established a single system of courts to uphold both federal and state laws.\n\nIn the USA, however, separate courts\u2014one at the federal level and the other at the state level\u2014enforce both federal and state laws.\n\nThe GoI, 1935 provisions led to the establishment of the SC as India\u2019s federal court. Part V of the constitution deals with the SC\u2019s structure, independence, remit, authority, and processes in Articles 124 to 147. The legislature has the power to regulate them\n\nHigh Court\n\nHigh courts serve as lower courts in India\u2019s judicial hierarchy than the Supreme Court. A high court and a system of lower courts make up the state\u2019s judicial system. When the high courts were established in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras in 1862, the High Court institution was born in India.\n\nAccording to the Indian Constitution, there is a high court for each state, but the Parliament has the power to establish a common high court for two or more states.\n\nA state\u2019s territory and a high court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction are contiguous. Additionally, the Parliament has the authority to increase or decrease a high court\u2019s jurisdiction over a Union Territory.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0Writs jurisdiction\n\nSub-ordinate courts\n\nBelow the High Courts are subordinate courts, which include district courts and other specialized courts. These courts handle cases at the district and lower levels, including civil, criminal, and family matters.\n\nAt the district and state levels, these courts serve as an adjunct to the High Court.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS\n\nThe following provisions are made by Articles 233 to 237 in Part VI of the constitution to control how subordinate courts are set up and to guarantee their independence from the executive.\n\nDistrict judge appointments: The governor consults with the high court before making any appointments.\n\nSTRUCTURE AND JURISDICTION\n\nThe organization, jurisdiction, and nomenclature of the subordinate judiciary are laid down by the states\n\nThere are three tiers of civil and criminal courts below the high court.\n\nCriminal courts:\n\nSessions judge\u2019s court (district level)\nChief Judicial Magistrate court\nJudicial magistrate court\n\nCivil court:\n\nDistrict Judge\nSubordinate Judge\u2019s court\nMunsiff\u2019s court\n\nThe district judge is the most senior member of the judicial branch. In both civil and criminal cases, he has both original and appellate authority.\n\nHe is referred to as the district judge when handling civil cases and as the session judge when hearing criminal proceedings. A convicted felon could get both life in prison and the death penalty from the session\u2019s judge. However, the High Court should affirm such a judgment.\n\nIndependence of Judiciary\n\nAlthough the idea of judicial independence is relatively new, it is largely acknowledged as a distinguishing feature of a liberal democratic society. However, there is no definition of independence in the Indian Constitution.\n\nJudicial independence, in terms of law, is the capacity to uphold the Rule of Law, individual liberty and freedom, equality before the law, and impartial, effective judicial oversight of the administrative and executive functions of the Government free from bias or fear.\n\nAs a result, no other organ or branch of the government should have any authority over the judicial arm of the state. According to this perspective, judicial independence is founded on the fact that the courts have the power to exercise their authority free from influence from the executive branch.\n\nJudicial review\n\nWhen a claim is made by the impacted party, the judiciary has the authority to assess any act or order made by the legislative or executive branches and to rule on its constitutionality. The Indian Constitution itself confers the authority for judicial review (Articles 13, 32, 136, 142, and 147 of the Constitution).\n\nIndia has an independent judiciary with broad authority over legislative and executive actions. It is possible to define judicial review as the doctrine that allows the judiciary to assess legislative and executive decisions. It is typically seen as the foundation of an independent judiciary (Indira Gandhi vs. Raj Narain case).\n\nThe three types of judicial review, however, are reviews of legislative activities, reviews of judicial decisions, and reviews of administrative actions. Judges must therefore uphold the correct balance of authority and defend citizens\u2019 rights to life and liberty as well as human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nJudicial Overreach and Judicial Activism\n\nJudicial activism is a theory of judicial decision-making that substitutes constitutionalism for the judges\u2019 individual opinions on matters of public policy.\n\nBenefits of Judicial Overreach and Judicial Activism:\n\nSupports constitutional morality: The Naz Foundation Case, a significant case that creatively applied this idea, used constitutional morality to invalidate Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and decriminalize homosexuality.\nExecutive deficiency Political tenacity: In the Sabarimala ruling, Justice Chandrachud went against the majority of religious opinion by ruling that women should be permitted admission into the Sabarimala temple.\nDefend fundamental rights In 2017, triple talaq was outlawed because it violated Muslim women\u2019s fundamental rights.\nIf the executive branch or Parliament had proposed the legislation, it would not have been approved. For instance, Article 21 made the right to privacy a fundamental right.\nMost reliable institution: Indians had 80% trust in the Supreme Court, according to a People\u2019s Survey of India survey. The supreme court is important to protect the rule of law, while not being a body that is elected. Ex: Until Parliament passed legislation on the matter, the Whistle Blowers Act was provided against corrupt authorities and politicians.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0Judicial Review vs. Judicial Activism vs. Judicial Overreach\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas\u00a0"

Only 6 states in our country have bicameral legislature i.e., two houses namely, Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, and the rest of the States just have one house which is known as the Legislative Assembly.\n\nThe Indian states with bicameral legislature include\u00a0Odisha, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nParliament and State Legislatures: Functioning\n\nFunctions are assigned to the Ministry under the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 made by the President under Article 77(3) of the Constitution of India.\n\nParliament\n\nThe Parliament has the power to make laws on the Union List, and Concurrent List, and the power to make laws over subjects under the Residuary List. The functions and powers of the Indian Parliament can be divided into legislative, executive, financial, and other categories.\n\nThe President of India is an integral part of the Parliament and plays a key role in the legislative process, including giving assent to bills passed by both houses.\n\nIn simpler terms, the functions of Parliament are:\n\nMaking and passing laws on various subjects.\nDiscussing and debating important national issues.\nScrutinizing the work of the government through questions, debates, and discussions.\nApproving the government\u2019s budget and expenditures.\nAmending the Constitution and other important legislation.\nRepresenting the interests of the people and states.\nState Legislatures\n\nThe primary function of the State Legislature, like the Union Parliament, is law-making.

The Governor shall make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the Government of the State, and for the allocation among Ministers of the said business in so far as it is not business concerning which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion.\n\nParliament and State Legislatures: Powers and privileges\n\nParliamentary Privileges are a sum of special rights, immunities, and exemptions enjoyed by the two houses of the Parliament, the State Legislature, their committees, and their members. Privileges are necessary to secure the independence and effectiveness of their actions.\n\nParliament\n\nThe Constitution of India has extended parliamentary Privileges to those persons who are entitled to speak and take part in the proceedings of the House of Parliament or its committees. That means the Attorney General of India and the Union Ministers are entitled to such privileges.\n\nNote that the Parliamentary Privileges do not extend to the president.\n\nAlso Read: COM, Prime Minister, and Attorney General\n\nState Legislatures\n\nThe Constitution of India has also extended the Privileges of the State Legislature to those persons who are entitled to speak and take part in the proceedings of the House of the State Legislature or its committees. These include the Advocate General of the State and State Ministers.\n\nIssues\n\nRecent years have seen considerable thought and discussion regarding the demise of Parliament, the devaluation of parliamentary authority, declining standards of discussion, deterioration in the conduct and quality of Members, low levels of participation, and similar issues. Unsettling trends include a general skepticism about parliamentary institutions, a decline regarding customary parliamentary procedures, and disrespect for members.\n\nParliament\n\nParliament faces several challenges including the Criminalisation of Politics, the Decline of Representative Democracy, the Evil of Anti-Defection Law, Lowering Standards of Parliamentary Scrutiny, the Curb on Freedom of Speech, Weakened Opposition, etc.\n\nState Legislatures\n\nIf there is a sense of unease with the way the\u00a0 State legislatures are functioning, it may be due to a decline in recent years in both the quantity and quality of work done by them. Over the years the number of days on which the houses sit to transact legislative and other business has come down very significantly including the use of force to intimidate opponents, shouting, and shutting out of debate and discussion resulting in frequent adjournments.\n\nThere is increasing concern about the decline of the State legislature, falling standards of debate, and erosion of the moral authority, and prestige of the supreme tribune of the people. Also, it is of the utmost importance for the survival of democracy that Parliament and State Legislature continue to occupy a position of the highest esteem in the minds and hearts of the people.\n\nAlso read: Motions in Parliament\n\nParliament and State Legislatures: Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the Parliament and State Legislature in India serve as the primary legislative bodies at the central and state levels, respectively.\n\nThey play a crucial role in the lawmaking process, representing the interests of the people, discussing important issues, and holding the government accountable for its actions.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Motions are, in fact, the basis of all Parliamentary proceedings. Any matter of importance/public interest can be the subject matter of a motion. Read here to know about different motions in Parliament.\n\nA no-confidence was recently evoked in the Parliament monsoon session 2023.\n\nIn the Indian Parliament, members of both the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) participate in various types of motions to discuss and deliberate upon important matters, raise issues of public concern, and influence the legislative process.\n\nMotions in parliament play a crucial role in shaping debates, policy decisions, and the functioning of the parliamentary system.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMotions in Parliament\nTypes of motions in parliament\nSubstantive Motions\nSubstitute Motions\nSubsidiary Motions\nAncillary Motions\nSuperseding Motions\nAmendments\nOther types of motions in Parliament\nAdjournment Motion\nNo-Confidence Motion\nCensure Motion\nCalling Attention Motion\nPrivilege Motion\nSense of the House Motion\nMotion of Thanks\nMotion for a Select Committee\nNo-Day-Yet-Named Motions\nAdmissibility of motions in parliament\nResolutions\nTypes of Resolutions\nDifference between resolutions and motions in parliament\nConclusion\nMotions in Parliament\n\nThe term \u2018motion\u2019 in its wide sense means any proposal made to elicit a decision of the House.\n\nTo ascertain the will of the House regarding a matter before it, every question to be decided by the House must be proposed by a member in the form of a motion.\nEvery matter is determined in the House using a question put by the Chair on a motion made by a member and resolved in the affirmative or negative, as the case may be.\nThe question should repeat the terms of the motion and should be so framed as to be capable of expressing a decision of the House.\n\nDiscussion on a motion is initiated by the mover of the motion, and later, unless he withdraws it, the House either adopts in toto or with such amendments as it may like to make or it may reject it altogether.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe mover of a motion frames it in a form in which he/she wishes it ultimately to be passed by the House and on which the vote of the House can conveniently be taken.\nThe members who wish the motion to be passed in a different form may move amendments after the original motion has been proposed by the Speaker.\nThese amendments too should be in the form in which the motion as amended can be passed by the House and must, therefore, be relevant to the subject matter of the main motion.\n\nHowever, there are certain motions in parliament which per se are not put to vote in the House.\n\nRule 342 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha which governs such types of motions inter-alia provides that \u201ca motion that the policy or situation or statement or any other matter be taken into consideration shall not be put to the vote of the House, but the House shall proceed to discuss such matter immediately after the mover has concluded his speech and no further question shall be put after the debate at the appointed hour unless a member moves a substantive motion in substitution of the original motion in appropriate terms to be approved by the Speaker and vote of the House shall be taken on such motion\u201d.\n\nAlso read: Parliamentary Privileges\n\nTypes of motions in parliament\n\nMotions can be classified under the following categories, namely:\n\nSubstantive Motions\nSubstitute Motions\nSubsidiary Motions\nSubstantive Motions\nA substantive motion is a self-contained, independent proposal submitted for the approval of the House and drafted in such a way as to be capable of expressing a decision of the House, e.g., all resolutions are substantive motions.\nA substantive motion is a formal proposal made by a member for consideration by the House. It usually involves a substantive issue that requires a decision.\nSubstitute Motions\nMotions moved in substitution of the original motion for taking into consideration a policy or situation or statement or any other matter are called substitute motions.\nSuch motions, though drafted in such a way as to be capable of expressing an opinion by themselves are not, strictly speaking, substantive motions in as much as they depend upon the original motion.\nA substitute motion is presented as an alternative to an original motion that is under consideration. It allows members to propose different approaches or solutions to a problem.\n\nAfter the original motion that the policy or situation, etc. be taken into consideration has been placed before the House and the mover of the motion has concluded the speech, the House proceeds to discuss the matter.\n\nNo further question is put thereon after the debate. However, before the discussion commences, a member can move a substitute motion which, while conforming to the subject matter of the original motion, is so drawn up as to express an opinion of the House.\nThe substitute motion, being like an amendment to the original motion, is also placed before the House and is discussed along with the original motion.\nAmendments to substitute motions are not permissible. At the end of the debate, the substitute motion only is put to the vote of the House.\nSubsidiary Motions\n\nThey depend upon or relate to other motions or follow up on some proceedings in the House. They by themselves have no meaning and are not capable of stating the decision of the House without reference to the original motion or proceedings of the House.\n\nSubsidiary motions can be further divided into:\n\nAncillary Motions\nSuperseding Motions\nAmendments\nANCILLARY MOTIONS\n\nThese are motions that are recognized by the practice of the House as the regular way of proceedings with various kinds of business. Examples of ancillary motions are:\n\nThat the Bill be taken into consideration.\nThat the Bill be passed.\nSUPERSEDING MOTIONS\n\nThese are motions which, though independent in form, are moved in the course of debate on another question and seek to supersede that question. In this class fall all motions of dilatory character.\n\nThe following are superseding motions about the motion for taking into consideration a Bill:\n\nThat the Bill be re-committed to a Select Committee.\nThat the Bill be re-committed to a Joint Committee of the Houses.\nThat the Bill be circulated for eliciting further opinion thereon.\nThat consideration of the Bill or the debate on the Bill is adjourned sine-die or to some future date.\nAMENDMENTS\n\nThese are subsidiary motions that interpose a new process of question and decision between the main question and its decision.\n\nAmendments may be to the clauses of a Bill, to a resolution or to a motion, or an amendment to a clause of a Bill, resolution, or motion.\n\nOther types of motions in Parliament\n\nThe notice of a motion is given in writing and addressed to the Secretary-General. Notices of motions can be given from the date following the date of issue of summons for a session.\n\nTo ensure that members who are not in Delhi are not at a disadvantage regarding the tabling of notices of motion, inter-se priority of notices on the same subject received within a specified period after the date of issue of summons is determined by ballot.\nThe priority of notices received thereafter is determined according to the date and time of receipt.\nAdjournment Motion\n\nAn adjournment motion is moved by a member to draw the attention of the House to a specific matter of urgent public importance.\n\nIt leads to the suspension of normal business to discuss the matter immediately.\nIf admitted, the House may be adjourned to discuss the issue raised.\nNo-Confidence Motion\n\nA no-confidence motion is moved by a member to express a lack of confidence in the council of ministers (the government).\n\nIf the motion is accepted and debated, the government must prove its majority in the House.\nIf the motion is passed, it could lead to the resignation of the government.\nCensure Motion\n\nA censure motion is moved to criticize the government for specific actions or policies.\n\nIt does not entail the removal of the government but serves as a strong expression of disapproval.\nCalling Attention Motion\n\nA calling attention motion is moved by a member to call the attention of a minister to a specific matter of public importance and seek a reply.\n\nIt is typically used for matters that require immediate attention.\nPrivilege Motion\n\nA privilege motion is moved by a member who believes that their privileges, as well as the privileges of the House as a whole, have been violated.\n\nIt may relate to contempt of the House or breach of parliamentary privileges.\nSense of the House Motion\n\nA sense of House motion is a non-binding motion that seeks to express the collective opinion or sentiment of the members on a particular issue.\n\nMotion of Thanks\n\nThis motion is moved to express gratitude to the President of India for their address to both Houses of Parliament at the beginning of the session. It is typically moved in the Lok Sabha.\n\nMotion for a Select Committee\n\nA motion may be moved to refer a particular matter to a select committee for detailed examination and report.\n\nNo-Day-Yet-Named Motions\n\nIf the Speaker admits a notice of a motion and no day is fixed for its discussion, it is called a \u2018No-Day-Yet-Named Motion\u2019.\n\nAll such admitted motions are notified in Bulletin Part-II and are placed from time to time before the Business Advisory Committee which selects the motions according to the urgency and importance of the subject matter thereof and recommends time for discussion of the same.\nAdmissibility of motions in parliament\n\nThe admissibility of a motion or part thereof is decided by the Speaker. A motion may be disallowed by the Speaker if in his/her opinion it is an abuse of the right of moving a motion or is calculated to obstruct or prejudicially affects the procedure of the House or is in contravention of the rules.\n\nThe Speaker has the inherent power to rule out a motion at any time before it is voted upon on the ground that it involves an abuse of the forms and procedure of the House.\n\nA motion to be admissible must satisfy the following conditions:\n\nit shall raise substantially one definite issue;\nit shall not contain arguments, inferences, ironical expressions, imputations, or defamatory statements;\nit shall not refer to the conduct or character of persons except in their public capacity;\nit shall be restricted to a matter of recent occurrence;\nit shall not raise a question of privilege;\nit shall not revive discussion of a matter which has been discussed in the same session;\nit shall not anticipate discussion of a matter which is likely to be discussed in the same session;\nit shall not relate to any matter which is under adjudication by a court of law having jurisdiction in any part of India;\nif it contains a statement the member shall make himself responsible for the accuracy of the statement;\nit shall not seek discussion on a paper or document laid on the Table by a private member;\nit shall not ordinarily relate to matters which are under consideration of a Parliamentary Committee;\nit shall not ask for an expression of opinion or the solution of an abstract legal quest or a hypothetical proposition;\nit shall not relate to a matter which is not primarily the concern of the Government of India;\nit shall not raise a matter under the control of bodies or persons not primarily responsible to the Government of India;\nit shall not relate to a matter with which a Minister is not officially concerned;\nit shall not refer discourteously to a friendly foreign country;\nit shall not refer to or seek disclosure of information about matters which are in their nature secrets such as Cabinet discussions or advice given to the about elation to any matter in respect of which there is a constitutional, statutory, or conventional obligation not to disclose information; and\nit shall not relate to a trivial matter. (Rule 186)\nResolutions\n\nA resolution is one of the procedural devices to raise a discussion in the House on a matter of general public interest. Subject to the provisions of the rules, a member or a Minister may move a resolution.\n\nA resolution for being admissible should satisfy the following conditions:\n\nit shall be clearly and precisely expressed;\nit shall raise substantially one definite issue;\nit shall not contain arguments, inferences, ironical expressions, imputations, or defamatory statements;\nit shall not refer to the conduct or character of persons except in their official or public capacity; and\nit shall not relate to any matter which is under adjudication by a court of law having jurisdiction in any part of India. [Rule 173]\nTypes of Resolutions\n\nResolutions may be classified as:\n\nPrivate Members\u2019 Resolutions\nGovernment Resolutions\nStatutory Resolutions\n\nPrivate Members\u2019 Resolutions\n\nResolutions that are moved by private members are termed Private Members\u2019 Resolutions.\nA member who desires to move a resolution has, in the first instance only to give written intimation to that effect at least two days before the date of ballot. The names of members from whom such intimations are received are balloted.\nA Private Member\u2019s Resolution, when adopted, is not binding. It is up to the Government to implement the provisions contained in the resolution which had been adopted by the House.\n\nGovernment Resolutions\n\nThough no period of notice has been prescribed for Government resolutions, in actual practice, Ministers give notice of their resolutions several days in advance of the date on which the item is proposed to be included in the list of business.\n\nAfter the notice of a resolution given by a Minister has been admitted by the Speaker, it is published in the Bulletin.\nTime for discussion of a government resolution is allotted by the House on the recommendation of the Business Advisory Committee.\nThe resolution may be moved by the Minister-in-charge or, in his/her absence, by any other Minister on his/her behalf.\n\nThe four broad categories under which Government resolutions may be classified are:\n\nResolutions approving international treaties, conventions, or agreements to which the Government is a party\nResolutions declaring or approving certain policies of the Government\nResolutions approving recommendations of certain Committees\nResolutions for approval of the proposal of the Government to reject the Award given by the Board of Arbitration\n\nStatutory Resolutions\n\nResolutions tabled in pursuance of a provision in the Constitution or an Act of Parliament are termed statutory resolutions.\n\nNotice of such resolutions may be given either by a Minister or by a private member.\nCertain enactments, however, expressly require the Government to bring forward a resolution within a period of time.\nThere is no particular period of notice for moving a statutory resolution unless the period itself is prescribed in the particular article of the Constitution or in the section of the statute under which it is tabled.\nA statutory resolution, after it has been admitted by the Speaker, is published in the Bulletin, under the heading \u2018Statutory Resolution\u2019 for information of the members\nDifference between resolutions and motions in parliament\nAll resolutions are substantive motions. However, all motions need not be substantive, that is to say, they may not require to be voted upon in the House.\nThe difference between a resolution and a motion is more of a procedural nature than of content.\nQuite often both motion and resolution on the same subject are admitted with some slight change of form.\nConclusion\n\nThe motions of parliament provide members with a platform to voice their concerns, engage in debates, and influence legislative decisions.\n\nResolutions in the Indian Parliament provide a formal and structured way for members to express their opinions, seek decisions on specific matters, and influence policy discussions. They play a significant role in shaping the legislative process, deliberations, and the functioning of the parliamentary system.\n\nAlso read: Types of Majorities Used in the Indian Parliament \u2013 Absolute, Effective, Simple, and Special Majority\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

            "[CONTENT]": "What is the Supreme Court Verdict on ECI Appointments? Why Independence of the Election Commission of India is important? Read further to know.\n\nIn its ruling on March 2023, the Supreme Court of India effectively rewrote several of the Constitution\u2019s provisions by assuming the role of the Constituent Assembly.\n\nThe Court ordered that new rules be followed pertaining to the appointment of the Election Commissioner.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the Supreme Court\u2019s Verdict on ECI Appointments?\nBackground\nWhat is the Challenge?\nIndependence of Chief Election Commissioner\nAbout Chief Election Commissioner\nFunctions\nRemoval\nWhat is the Supreme Court\u2019s Verdict on ECI Appointments?\n\nAs per the latest Supreme Court Verdict on ECI Appointments, Supreme Court said that the President\u2019s appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and Election Commissioners will depend on the recommendations of a distinguished three-member committee, consisting of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India (CJI).\n\nBackground\n\nAnoop Baranwal filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in 2015, contending that successive governments failed in the constitutional obligation to set up a \u201cfair, just and transparent process\u201d for the selection of Election Commissioners.\n\nThe petitioner contended that the President\u2019s appointments were based solely on the counsel of the Executive, providing significant leeway for the governing party to pick someone whose allegiance is guaranteed, which makes the selection process susceptible to manipulations and bias.\n\nThe Centre opposed the petition, saying that there was no case so far of abuse of power by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC). According to the Centre, the State\u2019s executive branch is \u201cconsciously and purposefully\u201d involved in the appointment of Election Commissioners to the highest election body.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe dissatisfaction led the bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, to refer the matter to a five-judge Constitution Bench in October 2018 for a thorough examination.\n\nWhat is the Challenge?\n\nThe question of Separation of Power arises from the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the appointment of the Election Commission of India (ECI) as the Constitution places the power to make any law in this regard in the hands of Parliament. However, the Supreme Court has made it clear that its ruling is subject to any law passed by Parliament, which implies that Parliament can overturn it by passing a law.\n\nAlternatively, some argue that since Parliament has not passed any law on this issue, the Court has a responsibility to fill the \u201cconstitutional vacuum\u201d and provide guidance on the appointment of the ECI.\n\nIndependence of Chief Election Commissioner\n\nThe independence of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) is crucial for the functioning of a fair and impartial electoral process. The CEC is responsible for overseeing the conduct of elections in a country, and they play a critical role in ensuring that elections are free, fair, and transparent.\n\nIf the CEC is not independent, it may be subject to external pressures, such as political influence or interference, which could compromise its ability to carry out its duties impartially. This can lead to a range of negative consequences, such as voter suppression, biased election results, and a loss of public confidence in the electoral process.\n\nTo prevent such scenarios, it is essential to ensure that the CEC is free from any undue influence or interference, and they are empowered to carry out their duties without fear or favor. This can be achieved through various measures, such as providing the CEC with legal protections, giving them operational autonomy, and ensuring their appointment is made in a transparent and non partisan manner.\n\nAbout Chief Election Commissioner\n\nThe Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) is the head of the Election Commission of India (ECI), which is responsible for conducting free and fair elections in India. The CEC is appointed by the President of India and is assisted by two Election Commissioners. The appointment of Election Commissioners falls under the purview of Article 324(2) of the Constitution.\n\nUnder the Election Commission (Conditions of Service of Election Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991, the CEC and Election Commissioners have a tenure of six years, or until they attain the age of 65, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe CEC has a range of responsibilities, including overseeing the conduct of elections, supervising the registration of political parties, enforcing the Model Code of Conduct, and resolving disputes related to elections. The CEC also has the power to disqualify candidates for electoral malpractice and to cancel an election in case of gross irregularities. The CEC plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and fairness of the electoral process in India.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) is the head of the Election Commission of India, which is an autonomous constitutional body responsible for conducting free and fair elections in the country. The primary functions of the Chief Election Commissioner include:\n\nConducting Elections: The CEC is responsible for overseeing the entire electoral process in India, from the preparation of the electoral rolls to the conduct of elections and counting of votes.\n\nVoter Education: The CEC is also responsible for educating voters on the importance of participating in elections and the electoral process. This involves organizing awareness campaigns, voter registration drives, and other activities to encourage voter participation.\n\nElectoral Reforms: The CEC is responsible for recommending changes in the electoral process to ensure free and fair elections. This includes suggestions for changes in electoral laws, rules, and regulations.\n\nPolitical Party Registration: The CEC is responsible for the registration and de-registration of political parties in India. This includes ensuring that political parties follow the guidelines set by the Election Commission.\n\nElectoral Disputes: The CEC is also responsible for resolving electoral disputes and complaints related to the conduct of elections. This involves hearing complaints from political parties and individuals and taking appropriate action.\n\nRemoval\n\nThe Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) of India is appointed by the President of India and can only be removed from office under specific circumstances outlined in the Indian Constitution.\n\nAccording to Article 324 of the Indian Constitution, the CEC can be removed from office only on the grounds of proven misbehavior or incapacity. The process for removal is initiated by a petition to the President of India, signed by at least 100 members of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) or 50 members of the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament).\n\nThe petition is then referred to the Chief Justice of India, who appoints a three-member committee to investigate the charges. If the committee finds the charges to be true, the President can remove the CEC from office.\n\nIt is worth noting that the removal of the CEC is a rare occurrence, and there have been only a few instances where such action has been taken in the history of independent India. This is because the office of the CEC is considered to be non-partisan and independent, and any attempt to remove the CEC for political reasons would be viewed as a threat to the integrity of the electoral process.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

What are the challenges associated with this concept?\n\nThe right to be forgotten has been recognized by the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in 2018.\n\nThe GDPR provides individuals with the right to request the deletion of their personal information from online platforms or search engines, subject to certain conditions and limitations.\n\nIn this article, let us look deeply into the concept of the right to be forgotten.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRight to be Forgotten: Key Points\nK.S.

Visakha Industries 2018\nDraft of MeitY\nSignificance of the Right to be Forgotten\nChallenges\nOther Government Steps to Protect Privacy\nConclusion\nRight to be Forgotten: Key Points\n\nThe right to be forgotten is a legal concept that allows individuals to request the removal of their personal information from online platforms or search engines. It is based on the idea that individuals should have control over their personal data and the right to have their personal information deleted or removed from online platforms or search engines if it is no longer relevant or necessary.\n\nThe right to be forgotten is often associated with the right to privacy and data protection. It is designed to protect individuals from the potentially harmful effects of having their personal information available online, such as identity theft, cyberbullying, or discrimination.\n\nThe right to be forgotten is a relatively new concept in India and has not yet been fully recognized by the courts or the legislature. However, there have been some developments in recent years that have touched upon issues related to data privacy and the right to be forgotten.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso read: Digital Personal Data Protection\n\nK.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India 2017\n\nOne of the significant developments in this area was the recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right under article 21 of the Indian Constitution in the landmark case of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Another v. Union of India and Others in 2017. This case laid the foundation for recognizing the importance of data privacy and individual autonomy in India.\n\nGoogle LLC v. Visakha Industries 2018\n\nIn 2018, the Delhi High Court, in the case of Google LLC v. Visakha Industries and Another, directed Google to de-index certain web pages that contained allegedly defamatory content. While this case did not explicitly recognize the right to be forgotten, it did provide some guidance on how the courts in India may approach issues related to data privacy and online content.\n\nDraft of MeitY\n\nIn 2019, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released a draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill, which includes provisions related to the right to be forgotten. The bill recognizes the right of individuals to have their personal data erased in certain circumstances, including when the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, or if the individual withdraws their consent for the data to be processed.\n\nSignificance of the Right to be Forgotten\n\nThe right to be forgotten is a complex legal concept that can have both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of the key advantages of the right to be forgotten:\n\nProtects Privacy: The right to be forgotten can help individuals protect their privacy and personal information by allowing them to request the removal of their personal information from online platforms or search engines.\n\nReduces the Risk of Harm: The right to be forgotten can help reduce the risk of harm to individuals by preventing their personal information from being used for malicious purposes, such as identity theft.\n\nSupports Freedom of Expression: The right to be forgotten can support freedom of expression by allowing individuals to control their personal information and ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date.\n\nAlso read: Data Localisation\n\nChallenges\n\nHere are some of the key challenges of the right to be forgotten:\n\nLimitations on free speech: The right to be forgotten can potentially limit freedom of speech and the public\u2019s right to access information, as it can result in the removal of legitimate and important information from online platforms or search engines.\n\nTechnical challenges: The implementation of the right to be forgotten can be technically challenging, as it requires online platforms and search engines to develop complex systems for managing and removing personal information.\n\nConflicts with other legal rights: The right to be forgotten can conflict with other legal rights, such as the right to access information, the right to freedom of expression, and the right to conduct research and journalism.\n\nAlso read: Right to Disconnect\n\nOther Government Steps to Protect Privacy\n\nThe government has taken several steps to protect privacy in India. Here are some of the key steps taken by the government:\n\nAadhaar Act: The Aadhaar Act was enacted in 2016 to establish a unique identification system for Indian residents. The act includes provisions related to data protection and privacy, including the requirement to obtain consent from individuals before collecting their personal information.\nPersonal Data Protection Bill: The government introduced the Personal Data Protection Bill in 2019, which aims to provide a comprehensive framework for the protection of personal data in India. The bill includes provisions related to data privacy, data localization, and the right to be forgotten.\nThe Cyber Security Policy: The Indian government introduced the National Cyber Security Policy in 2013, which includes measures to protect personal data from cyber threats and enhance cybersecurity in India.\nIT Act: The Information Technology Act was enacted in 2000 to provide legal recognition for electronic transactions and protect electronic records and data. The act includes provisions related to data privacy and data protection.\nConclusion\n\nOverall, the right to be forgotten is still in the process of development in India, and there is no specific case that has been solely responsible for its development. Moreover, with the recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right and the introduction of the Personal Data Protection Bill, the right to be forgotten is gaining increasing attention from both the courts and the legislature in India.\n\nHowever, it is important to carefully balance the right to be forgotten with other legal and social interests, such as freedom of expression and access to information, in order to ensure that it is used in a responsible and ethical manner.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

However, the government established a separate Ministry of Cooperation in July 2021.\nBy way of the 97th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2011, Section IXB was added to the Constitution.\nIt is now necessary to revise the Act in light of the addition of Part IXB.\nThe ability to establish cooperative societies is a part of the right to freedom under the 97th Amendment (Article 19(1)).\nAs one of the DPSPs, the promotion of cooperative societies was added (Article 43-B).\nMoreover, modifications to the Act were required as a result of developments throughout time to enhance the cooperative movement in multi-State cooperative organizations.\nWhat are the Proposed Amendments to Cooperative Society?\n\nOnly multi-state cooperative societies are permitted to merge and create new multi-state cooperative societies, according to a law that was passed 20 years ago.\n\nThe merger of Cooperatives:\nA resolution adopted by a majority (at least 2/3rds) of the members present and voting at a general meeting of such society is required by the Bill for \u201cany cooperative society\u201d to merge into an existing MSCS.\nCurrently, only an existing MSCS can merge to create a new MSCS.\nCo-operative Election Authority:\nThe bill aims to create a \u201cCo-operative Election Authority\u201d to implement \u201celectoral reforms\u201d in the cooperative industry.\nThe Authority will have a Chairperson, a Vice-Chairperson, and up to three other members who will be chosen by the Center.\nAll of the members will be available for reappointment after serving for three years or until they turn 65, whichever comes first.\nStricter Punishments:\nThe Bill aims to raise the fines associated with specific offenses.\nIf the board of directors or officials receive any illegal gains while conducting business on behalf of this society, they will be punished with either a fine or imprisonment for a time that must be at least one month long but may go up to one year.\nCooperative Ombudsman:\nThe government has suggested appointing one or more \u201cCo-operative Ombudsman\u201d positions with geographical jurisdiction to look into member complaints.\nThe Co-operative Ombudsman will have civil court-like authority over summoning and interrogation.\nRehabilitation and Development Fund:\nThe Bill also seeks the \u201cestablishment of the Co-operative Rehabilitation, Reconstruction and Development Fund\u201d for the revival of \u201csick MSCS\u201d.\nIt also proposes to insert a new section\u00a070A relating to \u201cconcurrent audit\u201d for MSCSs\u00a0having an annual turnover or deposit of more than the amount as determined by the Central Government.\nSection 70A:\nThe bill proposes to insert a new Section 70A relating to\u00a0concurrent audits for such multi-state societies with an annual turnover or deposit of more than the amount as determined by the Centre.\nFund for sick cooperative societies:\nThe Bill has a provision to establish the Co-operative Rehabilitation, Reconstruction and Development Fund for the revival of sick multi-state co-operative societies. A sick multi-state co-operative society has accumulated losses equal to or exceeding the total of its paid-up capital, free reserves, and surpluses, and has suffered cash losses in the past two years.\nThe Fund will be financed by multi-state co-operative societies that are in profit for the last 3 financial years. They will deposit either one crore rupees or 1% of the net profit into the Fund, whichever is less.\nSpecified cooperative societies:\nAccording to the original Act, the Union government may give directions and supersede the boards of specified multi-state co-operative societies where the Union government has a shareholding of at least 51%.\nThe new Bill amends this provision and added that the Union government may give directions and supersede the boards of any multi-state co-operative society where the government has any shareholding or has extended any loan, financial assistance, or guarantee.\nComposition of the board of directors:\nUnder the original Act, the board of a multi-state co-operative society has a maximum of 21 directors. The board may co-opt two additional directors.\nThe Bill amends the composition of the board of directors to mandate the inclusion of; one Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe member, and 2 women members.\nThe co-opted members must have experience in the field of banking, financing, co-operative management, or specialization fields related to the functioning of the multi-state co-operative society.\n\nAlso read: Biological Diversity (Amendment) Bill 2021\n\nWhat are the Criticisms of the Proposed Bill?\n\nThe new fund will put an additional burden on MSCSs and affect their autonomy.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAgainst the federal structure:\n\nThe bill seeks to take away state governments\u2019 rights and is against the country\u2019s federal structure.\nThe Bill seeks to amend Section 17 of the principal act to allow the merger of any State cooperative society with an existing MSCS.\nOpposition members argued that this was beyond the Centre\u2019s legislative competency as State cooperatives are not its domain.\n\nMismanagement and corruption:\n\nGovernment and legislative control of cooperatives increased over the years, there were increasing reports of mismanagement and corruption.\nWay Forward\n\nMore than 1500 multi-State cooperative organizations exist in India, and they are a significant resource for advancing the economic and social well-being of their members.\n\nThe amendment includes provisions for the establishment of the Cooperative Election Authority, Cooperative Information Officer, and Cooperative Ombudsman to make the governance of these multi-State Cooperative societies more democratic, open, and responsible.\n\nChanges to the current Act were required as a result of developments throughout time to boost the cooperative movement in multi-state cooperative societies. As a result, the administration suggested changing the Act.\n\nThe constitutional domain of States in regulating cooperative societies was upheld by the Supreme Court last year when it struck down a part of the 97th Constitution Amendment.\n\nThe court held that the Centre required the ratification of the Amendment by 50% of the state legislatures as it sought to give a framework for State legislation on cooperative societies.\n\nSC upheld only the part of the amendment that related to MSCSs, for which Parliament was competent to enact laws.\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed"

Read further to know more.\n\nIndian Penal Code is the principal criminal code of India that defines crimes and provides punishments for almost all kinds of criminal and actionable wrongs. The IPC in its various sections defines specific crimes and provides punishment for them.

It is applicable to all Indian citizens. Since then, the IPC has been amended numerous times and is now supplemented by a variety of other criminal provisions. The IPC is currently divided into 23 chapters\u00a0and has\u00a0511 sections\u00a0in total.\nThe Indian Penal Code is the official criminal code of the Republic of India. It is a complete code intended to cover all aspects of criminal law.\nIt came into force in 1862 in all British Presidencies, although it did not apply to the Princely states, which had their own courts and legal systems.\nThe Indian Penal Code is a body of\u00a0substantive law. Substantive law is a law that defines civil law rights and responsibilities, as well as criminal law crimes and punishments.\nAs a result, the Indian Penal Code is the law that specifies the punishable offences, as well as their punishments or penalties, or both.\nThe punishments under this code are classified into five categories: death, life imprisonment, general imprisonment, forfeiture of property, and fine.\nPrior to the implementation of the Indian Penal Code,\u00a0Mohammedan Criminal Law\u00a0was applied to both Muslims and Hindus in India.\nHistory of the Indian Penal Code\nThe first draft of the Indian Penal Code was prepared by the First Law Commission, chaired by Thomas Babington Macaulay.\nThe draft was based on the simple codification of the law of England, while at the same time borrowing elements from the Napoleanic Code and Louisiana Civil Code of 1825.\nThe first draft of the Code was presented before the Governor-General in council in the year 1837, but subsequent revisions and amendments took two more decades.\nThe complete drafting of the code was done in 1850 and presented to the Legislative Council in 1856. It was delayed being placed on the statute book of British India due to the Indian Revolt of 1857.\nThe code came into force on January 1st, 1860 after undergoing many revisions and amendments by Barnes Peacock who would go on to serve as the first Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court.\nBefore the advent of the British, the penal law prevailing in India, for the most part, was the Muhammedan law. For the first few years of its administration, the East India Company did not interfere with the criminal law of the country and although in 1772, during the administration of Warren Hastings, the Company for the first time interfered, and henceforth till 1861, from time to time, the British Government did alter the Muhammedan law, yet up to 1862, when the Indian Penal Code came into operation, the Muhammedan law was undoubtedly the basis of the criminal law excepting in the presidency towns.\nThe epoch of the administration of Muslim criminal law in India extended for a considerable period and has even supplied many terms for the vocabulary of Indian law.\nStructure of the Indian Penal Code\n\nThe IPC in its various sections defines specific crimes and provides punishment for them. It is sub-divided into 23 chapters that comprise of 511 sections. The basic outline of the code is given in the table below:\n\nIndian Penal Code, 1860 (Sections 1 to 511)\nChapter\tSections covered\tClassification of offences\nChapter I\tSections 1 to 5\tIntroduction\nChapter II\tSections 6 to 52\tGeneral Explanations\nChapter III\tSections 53 to 75\tOf Punishments\nChapter IV\tSections 76 to 106\tGeneral Exceptions of the Right of Private Defence (Sections 96 to 106)\nChapter V\tSections 107 to 120\tOf Abetment\nChapter VA\tSections 120A to 120B\tCriminal Conspiracy\nChapter VI\tSections 121 to 130\tOf offences against the state\nChapter VII\tSections 131 to 140\tOf Offences relating to the Army, Navy, and Air Force\nChapter VIII\tSections 141 to 160\tOf Offences against the Public Tranquility\nChapter IX\tSections 161 to 171\tOf Offences by or relating to Public Servants\nChapter IXA\tSections 171A to 171I\tOf Offences Relating to Elections\nChapter X\tSections 172 to 190\tOf Contempts of Lawful; Authority of Public Servants\nChapter XI\tSections 191 to 229\tOf False Evidence and Offence against Public Justice\nChapter XII\tSections 230 to 263\tOf Offences relating to coin and Government Stamps\nChapter XIII\tSections 264 to 267\tOf Offences relating to Weight and Measures\nChapter XIV\tSections 268 to 294\tOf offences affecting the Public Health, Safety, Convenience, Decency and Morals\nChapter XV\tSections 295 to 298\tOf Offences relating to religion\nChapter XVI\tSections 299 to 377\tOf Offences affecting the Human Body.\n\nOf Offences Affecting Life including murder, culpable homicide (Sections 299 to 311)\nOf the Causing of Miscarriage, of Injuries to Unborn Children, of the Exposure of Infants, and of the Concealment of Births (Sections 312 to 318)\nOf Hurt (Sections 319 to 338)\nOf Wrongful Restraint and Wrongful Confinement (Sections 339 to 348)\nOf Criminal Force and Assault (Sections 349 to 358)\nOf Kidnapping, Abduction, Slavery and Forced Labour (Sections 359 to 374)\nSexual Offences including rape and Sodomy (Sections 375 to 377)\n\nChapter XVII\tSections 378 to 462\tOf Offences Against Property\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nOf Theft (Sections 378 to 382)\nOf Extortion (Sections 383 to 389)\nOf Robbery and Dacoity (Sections 390 to 402)\nOf Criminal Misappropriation of Property (Sections 403 to 404)\nOf Criminal Breach of Trust (Sections 405 to 409)\nOf the Receiving of Stolen Property (Sections 410 to 414)\nOf Cheating (Section 415 to 420)\nOf Fraudulent Deeds and Disposition of Property (Sections 421 to 424)\nOf Mischief (Sections 425 to 440)\nOf Criminal Trespass (Sections 441 to 462)\n\nChapter XVIII\tSection 463 to 489 \u2013 E\tOffences relating to Documents and Property Marks\n\nOffences relating to Documents (Section 463 to 477-A)\nOffences relating to Property and Other Marks (Sections 478 to 489)\nOffences relating to Currency Notes and Bank Notes (Sections 489A to 489E)\n\nChapter XIX\tSections 490 to 492\tOf the Criminal Breach of Contracts of Service\nChapter XX\tSections 493 to 498\tOf Offences Relating to Marriage\nChapter XXA\tSections 498A\tOf Cruelty by Husband or Relatives of Husband\nChapter XXI\tSections 499 to 502\tOf Defamation\nChapter XXII\tSections 503 to 510\tOf Criminal intimidation, Insult and Annoyance\nChapter XXIII\tSection 511\tOf Attempts to Commit Offences\nCrimes against the Human Body:\n\nThese offences are provided for in Chapter XVI of the Code spanning from Section 299, which deals with culpable homicide to Section 377, which deals with unnatural offences.\n\nThe chapter deals with all kinds of offences which can be committed against the human body, from the very lowest degree i.e. simple hurt or assault to the gravest ones which include murder, kidnapping and rape.\n\nCrimes against Property:\n\nThese crimes are defined and punished under Chapter XVII and range from Section 378 which defines theft, to Section 462 which prescribes punishment for the offence of breaking upon an entrusted property. The offences that are dealt with under this chapter include, among others, theft, extortion, robbery, dacoity, cheating and forgery.\n\nCrimes against Public Tranquillity:\n\nThe definitions and punishment for this category of offences are provided in Chapter VIII which ranges from Section 141 to 160. This chapter lays down the acts which are considered to be criminal in nature because they disturb and destroy public tranquillity and order.\u00a0 This chapter includes offences like being a member of an unlawful assembly, rioting and affray.\n\nOffences against the State:\n\nChapter VI, which deals with offences of this nature, and includes Sections 121 to 130 are some of the most rigorous penal provisions of the entire code. This includes the offence of waging war against the state under Section 121 and the much-debated, criticised, and abused offence of Sedition under Section 124A. The offence defined under this Section has been much maligned as it was used by the British to prosecute many freedom fighters; it has also been used post-independence to silence critics of the government and continues to date which is why many experts advocate repealing the same.\n\nGeneral Exceptions:\n\nSections 76-106 (Chapter IV) embody the general exceptions which are exceptional circumstances where the offender can escape criminal liability. A basic example in this context is the Right of Private Defence (Section 96-106). Other concepts that are elaborated upon in this chapter include Insanity, Necessity, Consent, and acts of children below a certain age.\n\nDebated Provisions of the Indian Penal code:\n\nThe IPC has been successful by and large in its attempt to prosecute and punish individuals who commit the crimes that are defined in this Code, but like Sedition there have been certain other provisions that have invited scrutiny time and again. Some of these provisions are as follows:\n\nUnnatural Offences-Section 377:\n\nThis Section, among other things, punished consensual sexual acts between consenting adults belonging to the same sex. With the advent of time, several voices advocated for the decriminalisation of this part which punishes homosexuality. The Supreme Court, finally in the case of Navtej Johar, obliged and decriminalised the portion of this Section which punished consensual acts of this nature.\n\nAttempt to Commit Suicide \u2013 Section 309 of Indian Penal code:\n\nThis Section prescribed punishment of up to one year for attempting suicide. There is a longstanding recommendation of the Law Commission to decriminalise attempting suicide by dropping Section 309 from the statute books. But the amendment to this effect has not been carried, albeit, the use of the provision has minimized, by the coming into force of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017.\n\nAs per the non-obstante clause contained in Section 115(1) of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, there is the presumption of severe stress on a person who attempted suicide and such person is not to be punished under Section 309 IPC.\n\nBut the reports about the use of Section 309 IPC are not unknown and continue to be reported from almost all the parts of the country. As such, it is the need of the hour that the police authorities should be sanitized about the issue.\n\nAdultery \u2013 Section 497 of Indian Penal code:\nThis Section, which criminalised and prescribed punishment, was criticised for treating a woman as the private property of her husband and imposing moral principles on married couples.\nThis Section was finally struck down by the Supreme Court in September 2018 while disposing of the case of Joseph Shine v. Union of India.\nThe Code also provides for imposing the death penalty in certain offences like murder, rape, and waging war against the government. Several human rights groups call for the abolition of the death penalty citing data to suggest that the imposition of this punishment, in addition to being arbitrary, is also against the very human rights of the offender.\nReview of the Indian Penal Code Post-Independence\nIPC as a statute has survived and flourished over the last 160 years, which speaks volumes about its effectiveness as a penal code of high stature. However, over these years it has not been able to shed away some of its provisions that reek of colonialism e.g. sedition.\nThe Malimath Committee report while advocating criminal justice reforms has provided the Parliament with an opportunity to revamp the Code and other criminal laws. It has been 17 years since the submission of the report and no concrete steps have been taken in this respect.\nIt is about time that the legislature steps in to make the Code more in sync with modern times than with the times of British colonialism. It does not reflect well on the legislature when the apex court intervenes and strikes off laws because it is the job of the legislature to do so in the first place.\nEven though the IPC has been haphazardly amended more than 75 times, no comprehensive revision has been undertaken despite the 42nd report of the law commission in 1971 recommending it \u2014 the amendment bills of 1971 and 1978 lapsed due to the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. As such it has undergone many amendments that have been ad hoc and reactive.\nThe nature of the Indian Penal Code has been highlighted as that one of \u2018Master and Servant\u2019, with some of the provisions having no place in Independent India.\nSome of the sections that need reform and review are as follows:\nA re-examination of the sedition law, inserted in 1898, is necessary.\nThe offence of blasphemy should have no place in a liberal democracy and, therefore, there is a need to repeal Section 295A, which was inserted in 1927.\nA criminal conspiracy was made a substantive offence in 1913. The offence is objectionable because it was added to the code by the colonial authorities to deal with political conspiracies.\nUnder Section 149 on unlawful assembly, the principle of constructive liability is pushed to unduly harsh lengths.\nSexual offences under the code reveal patriarchal values and outdated Victorian morality. Though the outmoded crime of adultery gives the husband sole proprietary rights over his wife\u2019s sexuality, it gives no legal protection to secure a similar monopoly over the husband\u2019s sexuality.\nIndian Penal Code \u2013 Significance\nThe Indian Penal Code applies to all Indian citizens who commit crimes or act in a way that suggests misconduct on Indian territory.\nThe document applies to ships as well as aircraft operating in Indian seas or airspace.\nIt serves as a standard document for all decision-making and penalising norms in cases of crimes or misconduct.\nThe impartial nature of the judgments promoted by the Indian Penal Code is the document\u2019s most important feature. The Indian Penal Code makes no exceptions for any special person in any position.\nThe Indian Penal Code contains all relevant criminal offences dealing with offences against the state, public offences, armed forces offences, kidnapping, murder, and rape.\nIt deals with religious offences, property offences, and has an important section for marriage offences, cruelty from husband or relatives, defamation, and so on.\nCriticism of Indian Penal code\nThe nature of the Indian Penal Code has been characterized as that of\u201dMaster and Servant,\u201d\u00a0with some provisions having no place in Independent India.\nThe Code allows for the death penalty to be imposed for certain crimes such as murder, rape, and waging war against the government.\nSeveral human rights organizations have called for the abolition of the death penalty, citing data to show that, in addition to being arbitrary, the imposition of this punishment violates the offender\u2019s very human rights.\nThis code has not been able to shed some of its provisions that reek of colonialism, such as\u00a0sedition,\u00a0over the years.\nWhile advocating criminal justice reforms, the\u00a0Malimath Committee report\u00a0has provided the Parliament with an opportunity to revise the Code and other criminal laws.\nIt has been 17 years since the report was submitted, and no concrete steps have been taken in this regard.\nIt is high time that the legislature intervenes and makes the Code more in line with modern times rather than British colonialism.\nWhen the Supreme Court intervenes and strikes down laws, it does not reflect well on the legislature because it is the legislature\u2019s responsibility to do so in the first place.\nAreas that need reforms in Indian Penal code\n\nSome of the concepts underlying the code are either problematic or have become obsolete.\n\nA re-examination of the\u00a0sedition law,\u00a0inserted in 1898, is necessary.\nThe\u00a0offence of blasphemy\u00a0should have no place in a liberal democracy and, therefore, there is a need to repeal Section 295A, which was inserted in 1927.\nCriminal conspiracy\u00a0was made a substantive offence in 1913. The offence is objectionable because it was added to the code by the colonial masters to deal with political conspiracies.\nUnder\u00a0Section 149 on unlawful assembly,\u00a0the principle of constructive liability is pushed to unduly harsh lengths.\nThe\u00a0distinction between \u201cculpable homicide\u201d and \u201cmurder\u201d\u00a0was criticised even by Stephen as the \u201cweakest part of the code\u201d, as the definitions are obscure.\nSexual offences under the code reveal patriarchal values and Victorian morality.\u00a0Though the outmoded crime of adultery gives the husband sole proprietary rights over his wife\u2019s sexuality, it gives\u00a0no legal protection to\u00a0secure similar monopoly over the husband\u2019s sexuality.\nSection 377\u00a0also needs a review.\nWay forward\n\nThe Malimath Committee (2003) has made following suggestions for a comprehensive for reforming and restructuring of IPC:\n\nLegal research:\u00a0There is a need to have empirical legal research showing areas required to be contemplated as new offences in the code.\nEnforceability check:\u00a0The same process should also be applied in case of identification of offences to be dropped from the IPC on account of being outdated nature and issues of enforceability involved in them.\nGender-based offences:\u00a0There is no separate chapter on sexual offences in IPC. It is therefore the right time to dedicate a full chapter on this subject to bring all sexual offences at one place.\nCover modern laws:\u00a0To be comprehensive enough, the IPC must also include chapters on cyber laws, economic offences, and terrorist offences in the code. This would be helpful in avoiding duplicity and confusion.\nIndigenization:\u00a0In revision, the indigenousness in the framing of laws must be given space which was completely left out by the IPC.\nParallel reforms in Policing:\u00a0Although revamping IPC will lead to reforming the criminal justice system, additional changes in the police structure are also needed.\nConclusion\nOverall, the modern Indian Penal Code has eliminated almost all of its flaws and evolved into a modern law-enforcing document that considers the humane side of the personalities of perpetrators as well.\nThis has elevated and improved the Indian legal system to greater heights, resulting in a strong respect for it among all citizens of the country.\nThe Indian Penal Code is the most important document for all law enforcers and the entire Indian judiciary.\nReforming the criminal justice system is not just a one-step process.\nRevamping IPC is a major step to modernize the criminal law of India and make it in accordance with the Indian democracy.\nFulfilling political agendas should not be the reason behind adding specific provision.\n\nRead:\u00a0Revised Criminal Laws\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

Read further to know more.\n\nThe Center categorises states with socioeconomic and geographic disadvantages as having special category status to help them flourish. Under the Fifth Finance Commission\u2019s advice, this classification was made in 1969.\n\nIndia is a \u201cunion of the states\u201d. There are currently 29 states and 7 union territories in India. According to the recommendations of the Finance Commission, which the President of India established, all of these states and union territories receive a portion of the central government\u2019s revenues every five years.\n\nAccording to Article 275 of the Indian Constitution, the central government may provide any state with additional financial aid outside of the recommendations of the Finance Commission. Out of the 29 Indian states, 11 already have the designation of Special Category States, and 5 more are requesting it. This is important to note.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSpecial Category Status\nHistorical Perspective\nCriteria to give the status of Special Category States\nStates with Special Category Status\nBenefits of Special Category Status\nConcerns Related To Special Category Status\nConclusion\nSpecial Category Status\n\nThree states\u2014Jammu and Kashmir (currently union territories), Assam, and Nagaland\u2014were granted the status of Special Category States in 1969 by the Fifth Finance Commission, under the chairmanship of Mahavir Tyagi. When the Gadgil formula was authorised in 1969, the idea of Special Category Status was first introduced.\n\nThe social, economic, and geographic backwardness of these three states was the justification for granting them special status.\nStates that meet certain requirements, including hilly and challenging terrain, strategic border locations, low per capita income, low population density, the presence of sizable tribal populations, economic and infrastructure backwardness, and the unviable nature of State finances, are given special category status.\n\u00a0In order to attain uniform growth, and equality, and promote inclusive development, some states require special attention due to their non-uniformity, unequal development, tribal areas, backwardness, and people\u2019s desires.\nOn the other hand, all of these special arrangements have emerged as a result of ongoing constitutional changes.\nThe Constitution does not contain any SCS provisions.\nThe National Development Council has in the past granted States with a variety of characteristics that call for particular consideration Special Category Status for plan assistance. Today, the central government handles it.\nHistorical Perspective\nGoal: To provide central assistance and tax breaks to underprivileged states as preferential treatment. Many states have received help from the National Development Council in the past as part of the Central Plan.\nAt first, only Assam, Nagaland, Jammu, and Kashmir received special status.\nUnder the 4th Five-Year Plan, Assam, Nagaland, and Jammu & Kashmir received special status (1969-1974).\nNote: On August 5, 2019, the Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order, 2019, was published by the President of India. The unique status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 is revoked.\nFive more states were included in the special category between 1974 and 1979. These include Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Sikkim, and Tripura.\nThe number of states with Special Category status rose to eleven in 1990, with the accession of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram.

Typically, this is done under the justification that the information is extremely sensitive and could jeopardise public safety or even national security.\n\nState authorities also use the fact that the revelation might have an impact on ongoing investigations as their justification.

Still, the Supreme Court has the authority to apply it thanks to Section 123 of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872 and Rule 7 of Order XIII of the Supreme Court Rules.\nLegality of Sealed Cover Jurisprudence\n\nThe doctrine of sealed cover is not defined by any specific law.\n\nRule 7 of Order XIII of the Supreme Court Rules:\nAccording to the aforementioned rule, no party shall be permitted access to the contents of any information if the Chief Justice or court instructs that it be kept under sealed cover or deems it to be confidential.\nExceptions include situations in which the Chief Justice personally directs that the opposing party be granted access.\nAdditionally, it states that material may be kept private if the public is not thought to benefit from its disclosure.\nSection 123 of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872:\nThis act protects official, unpublished papers about state business and prohibits public officials from being forced to reveal them.\nAdditional situations in which information may be sought in confidence or secrecy include those in which its disclosure may jeopardise an ongoing investigation, such as when it pertains to material included in a police case diary.\nOther instances:\nIf the disclosure of information jeopardises an ongoing investigation or invades a person\u2019s privacy, secrecy or confidence may be requested.\n\nAlso read: Procedure Established by Law vs Due Process of Law\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat are the issues with the Sealed Cover Jurisprudence?\n\nOnly a limited subset of public agency actions must be kept secret in a democracy. Such actions not only keep the public in the dark, but they also have an impact on how democracy makes general policy decisions or manages the welfare state.\n\nAgainst the Principles of Transparency and Accountability:\nIt is unfavourable to the Indian justice system\u2019s guiding principles of openness and accountability since it opposes the concept of an open court where decisions can be made in front of the public.\nEvidence \u201cmust be shared with both parties to the dispute in any adjudication process, especially one that includes fundamental rights,\u201d according to the law.\nReduce the Scope of Reasoning:\nTo increase the potential for arbitrariness in court rulings since judges are required to justify their judgements, which is impossible when those judgements are based on sensitive information.\nFurther debate is whether the state should be given the right to submit information in secret when previously existing protections, such as closed-door hearings, are adequate for sensitive data.\nObstruction to Fair Trial and Adjudication:\nIt is also\u00a0argued that not providing access to such documents\u00a0to the accused parties\u00a0obstructs their passage to a fair trial and adjudication.\nArbitrary in Nature:\nInstead of being a standard procedure, sealed covers depend on the individual judges\u2019 need to support a position in a given case.\nThis renders the exercise haphazard and random.\nCriticisms/Issues with Sealed Cover Jurisprudence\n\nThere are several criticisms raised against sealed cover jurisprudence.\n\nArbitrariness in Judgements:\nDue to the inability of judges to justify their conclusions when they are based on sensitive information, sealed envelopes increase the potential for arbitrariness in court judgements.\nSufficient protection already available:\nBecause current protections like in-camera hearings already provide appropriate security to sensitive information, the state shouldn\u2019t be given the prerogative to submit information in secrecy.\nPrinciple of natural justice:\nThe parties to a lawsuit must be given a fair opportunity to review the evidence, according to the principles of natural justice.\nDenying the accused parties access to such papers prevents them from receiving a fair trial and ruling.\nTransparency:\u00a0\nOne of the things that give the judiciary institution its legitimacy is transparency, which is severely constrained by this process.\nRight to know:\nThe justifications for court decisions must be made public so that the public can scrutinise them.\nCitizens cannot have this taken away from them by the Supreme Court\u2019s Guardians of Basic Rights.\n\nAlso read: Must Know Articles of Indian Constitution\n\nUse of Sealed cover jurisprudence by Courts in India\n\nIn this section, we list a few prominent cases where sealed-over jurisprudence was employed.\n\n2014 BCCI reforms case: In this case, the cricket body\u2019s probe committee filed its report to the Supreme Court in a sealed envelope, requesting that the names of nine cricketers suspected of the match and spot-fixing not be made public.\nBhima Koregaon case:\u00a0In this case, activists were arrested under the\u00a0Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. The Supreme Court had relied on information submitted by the Maharashtra police in a sealed cover.\nRafale fighter jet deal:\u00a0In this case, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to submit details in a sealed cover as the Centre had contended that the details related to the Rafale deal were subject to the Official Secrets Act and secrecy clauses in the agreement.\nNational Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam: The Supreme Court mandated the coordinator of the NRC to submit periodic reports in a sealed cover, which could neither be accessed by the government nor the petitioners.\nAre there any judgments dealing with Sealed Cover Jurisprudence?\n\nYes, there are. Following are some of the judgements made by the Supreme court and various high courts about sealed cover jurisprudence.\n\nIn\u00a0P Gopalakrishnan V. The State of Kerala, 2019,\u00a0the Supreme Court had said that disclosure of documents to the accused is constitutionally mandated, even if the investigation is ongoing.\nIn the\u00a0INX Media case in 2019, the Supreme Court criticised the Delhi High Court for basing its decision to deny bail on documents submitted by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a sealed cover.\nIn 2022, in a case involving the Bihar government, the Bench headed by Justice Ramana made it clear that it wanted all arguments to be presented in open court.\nOn hearing an appeal against the Centre\u2019s ban in the\u00a0MediaOne case, the SC said that it is not in favor of sealed cover jurisprudence.\nCritical Analysis of Sealed Cover Jurisprudence\n\nOn analyzing it deeply, we can identify both, arguments in favor of and arguments against sealed cover jurisprudence.\n\nArguments in favor Sealed Cover Jurisprudence\nThe authority of our Supreme Court has been expanded to include the capability of receiving case data in sealed envelopes.\nThis is done in extremely sensitive situations like defence deals or cases involving policies that would have a big influence on the economy of the nation.\nFor reasons of national security, sealed envelopes take on a key role in these circumstances and must always be used.\nEven in private cases, courts have in-camera procedures. This is so that incidents concerning people\u2019s private life are not permitted in court records.\nThe sealed cover doctrine is sometimes required because of this.\nArguments Against Sealed Cover Jurisprudence\nAgainst the principle of an open court:\u00a0The sealed cover orders fundamentally go against the cardinal principle of an open court and militate against the Supreme Court\u2019s function of public reasoning.\nAgainst principles of natural justice:\u00a0They violate the principles of natural justice as well, preventing parties from having a full appreciation of the facts of the case. It is not favourable to the principles of transparency and accountability of the Indian justice system.\nAgainst the Right to Know: The doctrine of sealed cover goes against the citizens\u2019 \u201cright to know\u201d. It excludes the public from crucial issues that impact their lives directly or indirectly.\nReasoning not given by Supreme Court:\u00a0The court orders provide no justifications for using sealed cover practice. There isn\u2019t even a verbal commitment to assess if the public interest is better served by the disclosure of truth.\nIt manipulates the final decision:\u00a0It vitiates the decision-making process and affects the outcome. Sealed covers have been allowed in cases where facts presented by the state needed to be debated and examined to settle the question of law.\nViolation of SC judgment:\u00a0It is argued that not providing access to such documents to the accused parties obstructs their passage to a fair trial and adjudication. In the 2019 judgment in the case of P Gopalakrishnan V. The State of Kerala, the Supreme Court said that disclosure of documents to the accused is constitutionally mandated.\nWay Ahead\nTribunals must make sure that opposing parties are given a fair chance to state their case and refute any supporting data or arguments.\nThe constitutional values of due process, a fair trial, and open justice must be balanced with the practice of sealed cover jurisprudence, which also needs to be justified in light of the particulars of the case.\nIn matters involving national security, the Supreme Court has recommended an alternative to habitually filing documents in sealed covers.\nThe judicial review procedure is important because it holds the executive responsible.\nParticularly when fundamental rights like the right to free speech are restricted, the executive branch must persuasively defend its actions.\nThe executive branch is not given carte blanche by the Indian Constitution to issue arbitrary orders that violate these rights.\nA court that watches any presidential action with quiet complacency is a crude example of democratic disintegration.\nThe court must consider the action\u2019s legality in light of proportionality when it is claimed that it has restricted basic rights.\nConclusion\nThere is currently uncertainty in the law about sealed covers.\nWhile confidentiality is required in some situations, it must be proven to be necessary.\nIn addition to maintaining the public\u2019s confidence in the court\u2019s decision-making and imposing checks and balances on the court\u2019s power, this would give sealed cover jurisprudence constitutional legitimacy.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

It implies that those who will be impacted by such decisions and their implementation have immediate and open access to the information.\nIt alludes to political and administrative decisions and actions being transparent in government.\nCivic rights like the right to information, open meetings, financial transparency, budgetary review and audit, and others are included in it.\nWhat Is Accountability?\nAccountability indicates that officials and administrative bodies must carry out the duties and responsibilities associated with their posts.\nGovernment, business, and civil society organisations must answer to the general public and institutional stakeholders for their decisions. The government must be held accountable at all levels because accountability is crucial for fighting corruption, which is widely regarded as a serious problem in governance.\nAccountability can be thought of as a form of acknowledgement, in contrast to transparency, which places a focus on openness.\nSimply put, it is having to defend one\u2019s decisions or actions.\nA person or organisation must take responsibility for their activities, own up to them, and transparently communicate the results.\nWhat has been done, what is being done right now, and what is planned are all explained and justified.\nCompliance with organisational policies, legal requirements, professional codes of behaviour, and responsiveness to all key stakeholders are often ways to attain accountability.\nIn today\u2019s setting of globalisation, there are many stakeholders, including the market, civil society, individuals, and the media, and accountability is complicated by everyone\u2019s participation in the governance process.\nTransparency and Accountability: Importance\nIt is crucial that the government operates openly and is held responsible for its decisions and deeds.\nThe government\u2019s role and operations are expanding: for quick development and social change.\nThe growth of women, children, the physically disabled, marginalised groups, and other issues were addressed by the new policies. All of this led to the expansion of governmental organisations with overlapping functional divisions.\nIn this situation, the need for transparency and accountability was felt in order to monitor how various departments were performing..\nTo check the powers and duties: The permanent executive became both the creator and the administrator of laws. Hence, the executive\u2019s powers were expanded.\nAs a result, accountability and transparency were vital to check the executive\u2019s powers and duties.\nParticipatory governance:\u00a0It can help to increase confidence and the effect of programmes.\nTransparency and accountability in governance may lead to significant changes in work culture, resulting in more concern for society.\nInformation:\u00a0Accountability and transparency provide a new method of giving real-time information through an online dashboard. This not only answers people\u2019s issues, but it also improves service quality.\nThe\u00a0link\u00a0between the government and the people may be improved, and citizens can feel\u00a0more connected.\nA two-way information channel will be established to better understand what consumers desire. \u201cListen, inquire, act, interact, and inform\u201d are concepts.\nInitiatives To Enhance Transparency In India\n\nRight to Information Act, Right to Public Service Legislation, Citizens Charters, e-Governance, and e-procurement are some of India\u2019s major initiatives to improve transparency.\n\nRight to Information (RTI) Act:\nIt is an act of the Indian Parliament that establishes the laws and procedures for\u00a0citizens\u2019 access to information.\u00a0It took the place of the\u00a0previous Freedom of Information Act of 2002.\nUnder the RTI Act, any Indian citizen may seek information from a \u201cpublic authority\u201d (a government entity or \u201cstate instrumentality\u201d), which is supposed to respond promptly or within thirty days.\nThe information must be delivered within 48 hours if the matter involves a petitioner\u2019s life or liberty. The RTI Bill was passed by the Parliament of India on 15 June 2005 and came into force with effect from\u00a012 October 2005.\nRight to Public Services legislation:\nIt consists of statutory laws that ensure the timely delivery of services for a variety of government services provided to citizens, as well as a system for disciplining errant public servants who fail to provide the service required by the statute.\nCitizen\u2019s Charter:\nA Citizens\u2019 Charter represents the commitment of the Organisation towards standard, quality, and time frame of service delivery, grievance redress mechanism, transparency, and accountability.\nIn its attempts to create a more responsive and citizen-friendly administration, the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances coordinates the efforts to formulate and operationalize Citizens\u2019 Charters.\nE-Governance:\nIt is defined as the use of information and communication technology (ICT) at all levels of government to provide citizens with services, interact with businesses, and communicate and exchange information between different government departments in a timely, efficient, and transparent manner.\nE-Procurement:\nCentral Public Procurement Portal is a robust and secure platform offering full transparency in public procurement for the Government of India, most States, and Local Governments across India.\nInitiatives To Enhance Accountability In India\nLokpal and Lokayukta\nIn the Republic of India, a Lokpal is an\u00a0anti-corruption authority\u00a0or ombudsman agency that represents the public interest.\nLokayukta is appointed by and for each of India\u2019s State Governments.\nLokpal has jurisdiction over the central government to investigate charges of corruption against its public officials and other corruption-related matters.\nLokayukta comes into action in a state after the state legislature passes the Lokayukta Act and a person with a good reputation is nominated for the position.\nFollowing Anna Hazare\u2019s Jan Lokpal agitation in 2011,\u00a0the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act was enacted with revisions in parliament in 2013.

Bhagwati\u00a0introduced public interest litigation (PIL) as a means of securing public interest and demonstrating the availability of justice to socially disadvantaged parties.\nCentralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS):\nPublic Problems Redressal is one of the hallmark efforts for governance reform launched by the Indian central government by addressing the grievances of the general public.\nThe\u00a0Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances\u00a0established CPGRAMS in June 2007.\nAny citizen of India can use the public grievance process to bring their problems, grievances, or requests to the attention of national and state government Ministries and Departments.\nCentral Vigilance Commission (CVC):\nThe Central Vigilance Commission is the apex vigilance institution, independent of any executive authority, charged with overseeing all vigilance activity under the Central Government and advising various authorities in Central Government organisations on vigilance planning, execution, review, and reform.\nVigilance entails taking clean and timely administrative action to improve staff efficiency and effectiveness, as well as the organisation\u2019s overall efficiency and effectiveness, as a lack of Vigilance leads to waste, losses, and economic deterioration.\nComptroller and Auditor General (CAG):\nThe CAG\u00a0is a constitutionally mandated person\u00a0tasked with keeping an eye on the government\u2019s finances and operations.\nHe/she is critical in making the government more transparent and responsible to both the legislature and civil society.\nThe CAG\u00a0audits the finances of the federal and state governments, as well as entities that are owned or funded by the government.\nThe CAG evaluates the performance of various government agencies, enterprises, pieces of legislation, and even welfare programs like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.\nPublic Accounts Committee:\nThe Public Accounts Body is a committee of selected members of parliament established by the Indian Parliament to audit the government\u2019s revenue and expenditure.\nThey ensure that parliament has control over the executive, based on the fundamental idea that parliament represents the people\u2019s will.\nSocial Audit in Local Governments\nA social audit, in the context of government schemes, is an accountability mechanism that measures, assesses, and identifies gaps in service delivery, as well as pledges to fix those gaps, with the direct participation of intended beneficiaries.\nConclusion\n\nAccountability and transparency are now recognised as crucial tenets for governing democratic democracies. Let\u2019s define accountability and transparency before discussing how they are benefited, what they need, and how significant they are. Additionally, accountability will be encouraged if the governance system is adequately transparent. Accountability and transparency should be related to an organization\u2019s goal, which should prioritise achieving the public good.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

            "[CONTENT]": "What are the important aspects of governance? What are the stakeholders of governance? Read further to know more.\n\nGovernance is commonly defined as political leaders exercising power or authority for the benefit of their country\u2019s citizens or subjects.\n\nIt is the complex process by which certain sectors of society wield power and enact and promulgate public policies that have a direct impact on human and institutional interactions, as well as economic and social development.\n\nThe proper and effective use of resources is central to governance.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nImportant aspects of Governance\nStakeholders of Governance\nGood Governance\nCorporate Governance\nProbity Governance\nTransparency and accountability\nConclusion\nImportant aspects of Governance\n\nGovernance refers to the processes and systems by which a society, organization, or group is managed and controlled. There are many important aspects of governance, including:\n\nParticipation: According to researchers, participation is an important factor for both males and females in good governance. Participation could be direct or via legitimate intermediary institutions or representatives. It can be established that representative democracy does not always imply that the concerns of the most vulnerable members of society are taken into account in decision-making. Participation must be well-informed and well-organized.\nRule of law: Good governance necessitates neutrally prescribed impartial legal structures. It also necessitates the full protection of human rights, particularly those of minorities. Impartial law enforcement necessitates an independent judiciary as well as an impartial and incorruptible police force. The rule of law is defined as the institutional process of creating, interpreting, and enforcing laws and other regulations. It means that government decisions must be based on the rule of law and that private businesses and individuals are protected from arbitrary decisions. Governance that is reliable is free of distortionary incentives such as corruption, favouritism, patronage, or capture by narrow private interest groups; it guarantees property and personal rights; and it achieves some level of social stability.\nResponsiveness: Institutions and processes must strive to serve all stakeholders within a reasonable timeframe.\nConsensus-oriented: Good governance necessitates the intervention of various interest groups in the culture in order to reach a broad agreement in a society for the benefit of the entire community and the manner in which it can be accomplished.\nEquity and inclusiveness: The well-being of a society is dependent on ensuring that all of its members believe they have a stake in it and do not feel excluded from the society\u2019s mainstream. This necessitates providing opportunities for all groups, particularly the most vulnerable, to improve or maintain their well-being.\nEfficiency: Governance should be efficient and effective, with processes and systems that are streamlined and optimized to achieve desired outcomes.\nStakeholders of Governance\nTypically, the stakeholders of governance at the national level can be categorised into three broad categories \u2013 State, Market and Civil Society.\nThe State consists of the various government organs (Legislature, Judiciary, and Executive) and their instrumentalities, as well as independent accountability mechanisms. It also includes various segments of actors (elected representatives, political executives, bureaucracy/civil servants at various levels, and so on).\nThe market includes both the organised and unorganised private sectors, which include businesses ranging from large corporate houses to small-scale industries/ establishments.\nCivil Society is the most diverse and typically includes all groups not included in (1) or (2). It includes Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Voluntary Organizations (VOs), media organisations/ associations, trade unions, religious groups, pressure groups\nGood Governance\n\nAccording to UNESCAP, good governance means processes and institutions that produce results which meet the needs of society while making the best use of resources at their disposal.

Read here more.\n\nProbity Governance\n\nProbity is defined as complete and confirmed integrity having strong moral principles. It is strict adherence to a code of ethics based on undeviating honesty. Never resorting to illicit practices or cheating during an exam can be good examples of probity. Read here more\n\nTransparency and accountability\n\nThis is critical for ensuring good governance in the public sector. Transparency is unquestionably required for accountability. This is inextricably linked and mutually beneficial. Read here more.\n\nConclusion\n\nEvery citizen of the country is concerned about the efficient operation of government. Citizens are willing to pay a premium for good government services, but what is required is a transparent, accountable, and understandable governance system free of bias and prejudice.\n\nTo restore good governance in the country, we need to reformulate our national strategy so that the Gandhian principle of \u201cAntyodaya\u201d takes precedence. India should also focus on developing governance probity, which will make governance more ethical.\n\nThe government should keep working on the ideals of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, and Sabka Vishwas in order to achieve inclusive and sustainable development.\n\nArticle written by: Remya"

The boundary realignment will be based on a line drawn by a committee in 1960.\nThe Namsai district in southern Arunachal Pradesh is headquartered in Namsai.\nThe background behind Namsai declaration\nThe controversy stretches back to the British Empire, when they introduced inner line control in 1873.\nThe North-East boundary tracts were eventually referred to the British-delineated planes and frontier Hills in 1915. Today\u2019s Arunachal Pradesh is made up of these Northeastern boundary tracts.\nIn 1954, the administrative authority was transferred to Assam, and the frontier tracts were given the new name Northeast Frontier Agency (NEFA).\nHowever, a subcommittee led by the chief minister of Assam issued several recommendations regarding the management of NEFA in 1951.\nAccording to the committee\u2019s report, Assam\u2019s Darrang and Lakhimpur districts received 3648 sq. km. of the plain region that had previously been in Arunachal Pradesh. This notification\u2019s rejection by Arunachal Pradesh has become a point of contention.\nIn 1954, it was given a new name\u2014North East Frontier Agency\u2014and given to the Central government.\nArunachal Pradesh, which became a union territory in 1972, has a complaint that Assam was arbitrarily given control over a number of forested tracts on the lowlands that had historically belonged to hill tribal chiefs and clans.\nPresent-day The North East Frontier Tract, which became Arunachal Pradesh in February 1987, was governed by the Governor of Assam on behalf of the President of India.\nA tripartite committee was established following the statehood of Arunachal Pradesh in 1987, and it made recommendations for the transfer of several Assamese regions to Arunachal Pradesh.\nThe boundary between the two states is 804.1 kilometres long. The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in this case after Assam objected.\nThe boundary between Arunachal Pradesh and Assam will be realigned in order to settle a long-running conflict using the line drawn on 29 topo-sheets by a high-powered committee in 1960.\n\nAlso read: Assam-Meghalaya Border Dispute: Recent Developments\n\nWhy did the demarcation become a bone of contention?\nAccording to Assam, the delineation set forth in the 1951 announcement is legitimate and constitutional.\nHowever, Arunachal Pradesh maintains that its residents were not consulted prior to the move. It was arbitrary, flawed, and no Arunachal Pradesh tribal leader was contacted. The tribes also paid taxes to the Ahom kings, and AP had customary rights over these areas.\nWhat steps were taken to handle the boundary dispute between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh?\nOut of 800 km in 1983\u20131984, 489 km were marked as boundaries. The suggestions were rejected by Arunachal Pradesh, preventing further demarcation.\nIn 1989, Assam brought a lawsuit before the Supreme Court exposing encroachment by Arunachal Pradesh. In 2006, the Court established a commission. In its report, which was submitted in 2014, the commission urged debate and consensus-building as a means of resolution.\nKey Highlights of Namsai declaration\n\nSome of the major highlights of the declaration are discussed here.\n\nBoundary line delineated by High-Powered Tripartite Committee taken as a basis of Namsai declaration.\nThe declaration specifies that both states would use the boundary line that was drawn and signed on 29 toposheets by the High-Powered Tripartite Committee as the notified boundary during the year 1960 as the foundation for realigning the border.\n12 Regional committees: In order to jointly verify 123 villages, both states decided to form 12 \u201cregional committees\u201d that each covered 12 districts in Arunachal Pradesh and their corresponding districts in Assam.\nThey will consider historical context, administrative convenience, contiguity, and the public\u2019s desire to define the interstate boundary when making their recommendations to the respective governments.\nRegarding 37 villages, both parties had general agreement.\nThe final decision on the basis of regional committees:\nBased on the recommendations of the regional committees, the ultimate choice will be made.\n\nAlso read: India-China Border Disputes \u2013 What is the Doklam Issue?\n\nDistribution of villages of Namsai declaration:\n28 villages that are part of Arunachal\u2019s constitutional border would still be included.\nAssam would retain possession of three villages for which Arunachal withdrew its claims.\nSix villages could not be found in Assam, and if they are there in Arunachal, they will remain there.\nWhy do inter-state border disputes remain unresolved?\nThough the 1956 States Reorganization Commission was founded on administrative convenience, the reformed states were mostly based on the notion of one language, one state.\nGeographical Complication: Geography has added another layer of complexity, as many rivers, hills, and woods literally traverse two states.\nLarge portions of the northeast outside of Assam have been labelled on colonial maps as \u201cdeep forests\u201d or \u201cunexplored,\u201d respectively.\nIndigenous Communities: In general, indigenous communities were left unattended. When the \u201cneed\u201d arose, boundaries would be drawn for administrative ease.\nThe differences were not resolved by the 1956 delineation.\nIt was still not solved when Assam was divided into new states (Nagaland in 1963, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Manipur in 1972, and Arunachal Pradesh in 1987).\nWay Forward\nThe exact border locations can be mapped using satellite technology to resolve boundary disputes between the states.\nAn alternative for settling an interstate disagreement is to revive the Inter-state council.\nThe Inter-state council is mandated by Article 263 of the Constitution to resolve disputes, examine issues that are relevant to all states, and offer suggestions for more effective policy cooperation.\nSimilar to this, it is necessary to resurrect Zonal councils in order to debate issues that affect states in each zone equally, such as interstate transportation, border conflicts, and social and economic planning.\nIndia is a wonderful example of harmony in contrast. The centre and state governments must both adopt the cooperative federalism mindset, nevertheless, if they want to further cement this unity.\nUPSC Civil Services Examination, Previous Year Questions (PYQs)\n\n1.

The French Revolution taught us that one individual with unchecked power may wreak devastation.\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, French philosopher Justice Bodin and British politician Locke both published their opinions on this topic.\nSeparation of powers was first included in a national constitution by the United States.\nIndia\u2019s case: The Constitution\u2019s drafters thought it was too late to incorporate the Separation of Powers principle because it had already been written. India developed a parliamentary system of governance as well. They, therefore, determined it would be wise to steer clear of adopting the American model of complete division of powers.\nConcept of the separation of powers\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

By requiring the consent of all three branches when creating, enforcing, and managing laws, it lessens the likelihood of arbitrary government actions.\nThe doctrine of the separation of powers primarily refers to three formulations of governmental powers; one individual should not serve in more than one capacity within any one of the three branches of government.\nAny interference from one governmental organ with another is improper.\nOne organ shouldn\u2019t do the duties that belong to another organ.\nNeed For Separation Of Power\nThere is a risk of poor management, corruption, nepotism, and the misuse of power when the government\u2019s power is concentrated in a single hand.\nTherefore, the separation of powers is necessary to prevent authoritarian rule in the nation, foster efficient government, stop the legislature from passing arbitrary or unconstitutional legislation, and protect individual liberty.\n\nAlso read: Indian Federalism \u2013 15 Issues that Challenge the Federal Structure of India\n\nConstitutional Provisions\n\nOur Constitution does not contain any specific clauses addressing the doctrine of separation of powers. However, the Constitution has a few guiding principles:\n\nThere is no formal or established division of powers outside of what is stated in Article 50 of our constitution, which states that \u201cthe state shall take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive in the public services of the state.\u201d\nThe executive authority of the Union and the State shall be vested in the President and the Governor, who are exempt from civil and criminal liability under Articles 53 and 143.\nArticles 121 and 211 prohibit discussion of the judicial actions of Supreme Court and High Court judges in the Parliament and State Legislature.\nArticles 122 and 212 which say no court may challenge the legality of legislative or parliamentary proceedings.\nAccording to Article 361 of the Constitution, neither the President nor the Governor is subject to legal accountability for the way in which they carry out their official responsibilities.\n\nAlso Read : Constitution of India: List of All Articles (1-395) and Parts (1-22) \u2013 Clear IAS\n\nDoctrine Of Separation Of Power\n\nIn a strict sense, the idea of separation of powers states that there should be a system of checks and balances as well as a clear demarcation between the three organs and their respective roles. When there is an improper blurring of the lines between the three organs\u2019 roles, the doctrine of separation of powers is violated.\n\nSeparation of Powers Between Various Organs\n\nPowers are separated as follows:\n\nLegislature\nThe Lok Sabha is the ultimate authority for the Council, which also produces ministers.\nIn cases of violation of its privileges, the impeachment of the President pursuant to Article 61, and the dismissal of judges, the legislature acts as a court.\nAccording to Article 105, the legislative body has the ability to punish (3).\nExecutive\nThe President of India is the Union\u2019s head of the Executive and a member of Parliament (Articles 53 and 74). He plays a legislative role in the Parliament (Article 111). Thus, the passage of the Bill required his approval.\nHe has the authority to issue ordinances under Article 123, as well as the judicial authority under Articles 103(1) and 217(3), consultation authority with the Supreme Court of India under Article 143, and pardoning authority under Article 72 of the Constitution.\nBy choosing judges for the Chief Justice of India and other offices, the executive has an impact on the judiciary as well.\nJudiciary\nAccording to Articles 142 and 145 of our constitution, the Supreme Court has the authority to rule that law passed by the legislature and executive actions are unconstitutional and void if they violate any provisions of the constitution or, in the case of legislative actions, the law passed by the legislature.\nEven Parliament\u2019s ability to modify the constitution is open to the Court\u2019s review.\nIf a constitutional amendment modifies the fundamental design of the document, the Court may declare it invalid. Courts have frequently given the Parliament instructions on how to formulate policies.\nChecks and balances provisions in the Indian Constitution\n\nThe Indian Constitution is founded on the concept of \u201cchecks and balances\u201d rather than the strict division of powers.\n\nTo prevent any one organ from becoming overly dominant, there are checks and balances in place. The Constitution makes ensuring that any organ\u2019s discretionary authority is used in a democratic manner.\nThe judiciary has the authority to scrutinise executive and legislative actions.\nParliament passed a bill in 1972 to implement Article 50, taking away the judicial authority previously held by the executive magistrate and transferring it to the judicial magistrate.\nThe Indian Constitution\u2019s Doctrine of Checks and Balance was introduced by the Supreme Court in the 1993 decision of P. Kannadasan v. Tamil Nadu State.\nIn accordance with Article 13, if a statute is arbitrary or unconstitutional, the judiciary has the authority to invalidate it.\nAdditionally, it has the authority to deem unconstitutional presidential actions void.\nThe legislature also assesses the performance of the executive.\nEven though the judiciary is autonomous, the executive appoints the judges.\nJudicial Decisions Regarding The Separation Of Powers\n\nBecause we follow a separation of functions rather than a separation of powers in India, we don\u2019t adhere to the notion in its strictest form.\n\nAlthough the notion of the separation of powers is not expressly established in the Constitution, the court found that it is broken when one organ of government fulfils the duties of another in the case of Ram Jawaya v. The State of Punjab. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that our constitution does not contemplate the assumption of functions that essentially belong to another organ or part of the state by one organ or part of the state, despite the fact that the Indian Constitution did not recognise the doctrine of separation of powers in its absolute rigidity. This is because the functions of the various parts or branches of the government were sufficiently differentiated.\nIn I.C. Golak Nath v. State of Punjab, the Supreme Court asserted that the Ninth Schedule breaches the Kesavananda Bharati notion of fundamental structure. As a result, the Ninth Schedule was made subject to judicial review, which is another aspect of the basic structure theory. If a statute is unconstitutional under the terms of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has the authority to declare it void.\nIn the case of Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain, the court came to the conclusion that our Constitution broadly embraces the doctrine of separation of powers. In contrast to the United States and Australia, India does not adhere to a strict definition of the separation of powers.\nThe Supreme Court was asked to decide in the Kesavananda Bharti Case of 1973 how much the legislature might alter the Constitution in accordance with the Constitution\u2019s provisions. It was claimed that Parliament was \u201cbetter\u201d and embodied the people\u2019s free will. As a result, the court lacked the authority to determine whether or not a statute\u2019s amendment to restrict individual freedom or the reach of judicial review was constitutional. The Court, however, rejected this claim and decided in favour of the appellant, citing the idea of the division of powers as a component of the \u201cbasic structure\u201d of our Constitution. Because of this, the idea of \u201cseparation of powers\u201d is acknowledged as a key component of our Constitution.\nConclusion\n\nA democratic government and diverse people like India cannot function under a constitution with a strict separation of powers. However, the three pillars of government can cooperate democratically thanks to deliberate and moderate constitutional functional overlaps.\n\nBy bridging the gap between the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of government, mutual collaboration like this improves the efficiency of government. A democracy cannot function well without adhering to the doctrine of separation of powers.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

The States should be included in the formulation of the Finance Commissions\u2019 final terms of the contract in an efficient manner.\nIt expressed worry over the rise in the amount of money being raised through cesses and surcharges. In order to reduce their contribution to gross tax income, it was advised that the Central Government review all of the current cesses and surcharges.\nDue to the strong connections between planned and unplanned spending, an expert committee may be formed to investigate how to distinguish between planned and unplanned spending.\nThe Finance Commission and the Planning Commission ought to work much more closely together. This cooperation will be greatly enhanced by synchronising the Finance Commission\u2019s and the five-year plan\u2019s time frames. The Punchhi Commission advised that another period synchronisation attempt be conducted.\nThe Ministry of Finance\u2019s Finance Commission Division should be turned into a full-fledged department, according to the 12th Finance Commission\u2019s recommendation. This would make it the permanent secretariat of the Finance Commission. This 12th Finance Commission recommendation was approved by the Punchhi Commission.\n\nAlso read: Indian Federalism \u2013 15 Issues that Challenge the Federal Structure of India\n\nCommission On Governor\n\nThe commission gave its recommendations on the post of Governor to ensure cordial center state relations. They include :\n\nHe needs to be from outside the State and a cool, aloof person who isn\u2019t very involved in its regional politics. At least two years before his appointment, he should be someone who has not participated actively in politics, generally or particularly recently.\nAfter consulting with the Chief Minister of the relevant State, he must be nominated.\nIt is necessary to establish a committee that will be in charge of selecting the governors. The Prime Minister, the Home Minister, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, and the affected State\u2019s Chief Minister may all be members of this committee.\nThe Constitution\u2019s Doctrine of Pleasure is repealed.\nHis tenure in office must be guaranteed, and it shouldn\u2019t be interrupted unless there are incredibly strong reasons or if he is the target of legal action. He must be given a fair chance to object to the grounds for removal and a chance to explain justification. In the event that the Governor is fired or resigns, the government is required to present a statement to both Houses of Parliament outlining the reasons for the termination or resignation, as applicable.\nImpeachment of the Governor is recommended by the state legislature.\nOther Important Punchhi Commission Recommendations\n\nSome other important recommendations of the Punchhi Commission are given below:\n\nIn the context of Article 355 and Article 356\nThe report suggested that Articles 355 and 356 of the Constitution should be changed in relation to those two articles. By limiting the misuse of authority by the centre, the suggestion aims to protect the interests of the States.\nIt was stated that the Center should just have control over the troublesome area rather than declaring an emergency over the entire state. An emergency should last for longer than three months.\nRegarding the Communal Violence Bill\nAccording to the Commission\u2019s recommendation, the Communal Violence Bill should be amended to allow the Centre to temporarily deploy its forces in the State without the State\u2019s permission.\nSuch a deployment of the military is only permitted for a week, after which the state must be consulted \u201cpost-facto.\u201d\nWith regard to the Concurrent List\nBefore laws are filed on issues that are on the concurrent list, the Commission advised that the States be consulted through the inter-state council.\nRegarding the National Integration Council\nIt suggested developing a superseding system for issues involving internal security. The National Integration Council could be the name of this organisation.\nAdditionally, it was suggested that this council hold at least one annual meeting and that a delegation of five council members visits any communally afflicted area within two days.\nRegarding the President\u2019s veto power\nThere should be a clause mandating that the State in question get notice within six months of the President\u2019s decision to use his pocket veto power.\nRegarding the Union\u2019s authority to make treaties\nThe commission recommended that the union\u2019s ability to negotiate treaties be restricted to those involving subjects on the State list. This will increase the representation of states in their internal affairs.\nThe Commission came to the conclusion that states ought to participate more in the drafting of treaties in response to their worries. This will make it possible for the various governmental levels to cohabit peacefully.\nPunchhi Commission On Choosing A Chief Minister By The Governor\n\nAdditionally, the Punchhi Commission provided the Governor with several recommendations for selecting a Chief Minister. The following principles should guide the Governor in selecting a Chief Minister:\n\nThe party or coalition of parties that enjoy the broadest support in the Legislative Assembly should be asked to form the government.\nThe head of the party should automatically be requested to become the Chief Minister if that party holds an absolute majority in the assembly.\nIn the absence of such a party, the Governor should appoint a Chief Minister from the party or group of parties listed below by giving each one of them a hearing in the order of preference listed below.\nA coalition of parties is established before the elections.\nWith the backing of other parties, including \u201cindependence,\u201d the largest single party stakes a claim to form the government.\nA post-election coalition of parties in which all the members form governments.\nA\u00a0 post-election coalition of political parties, including \u201cindependents,\u201d with some members coming from a government and others supporting it from the outside.\nConclusion\n\nInsightful recommendations for seamless coordination and cooperation between the union government and state governments were provided in the M.M. Punchhi Commission\u2019s report. Some of the ideas have been put into practice, such as having the governor come from outside the state. To get the most benefit from these guidelines, they should be carried out within a sound framework.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

There is a direct connection between physical infrastructure, personnel infrastructure, digital infrastructure, and pendency.\nEssential during difficult times: The criticality of adequate judicial infrastructure, particularly the digital, was very much felt during the course of the pandemic when courts were forced to opt for virtual mode.\nWhat are the reasons behind infrastructural lag?\nLack of funds: One of the primary reasons for the infrastructural lag in trial courts is the lack of funds.\nTo develop judicial infrastructure,\u00a0funds are extended by the central government and states\u00a0under the\u00a0Centrally-Sponsored Scheme\u00a0for Development of Judiciary Infrastructure, which\u00a0began in 1993\u00a0and was extended for another five years in July 2021.\nHowever,\u00a0states do not come forward with their share of funds\u00a0and consequently, money allocated under the scheme is often left unspent with them and lapses.\nUnderutilization of funds:\u00a0Not only lack of funds, but underutilization of funds meant for specific judicial infrastructure projects does not help either.\nIn some cases, they claimed,\u00a0states have also transferred part of the fund for non-judicial purposes.\nEven in the judiciary, particularly trial courts, nobody is willing to take responsibility for executing infrastructure projects.\nPoor budgetary allocations: Even after more than seven decades of independence, the budgetary allocations, including states, are still below 1 percent of the GDP.\n\nAlso read: Women in Judiciary\n\nWhat is the solution, then?\nThe National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation has been proposed by CJI. It will serve as the focal point for advancements in infrastructure.\nThe centrally supported program calls for both the federal and state governments to donate their respective portions of the monies to the NJIC, which will subsequently release the funds to the high courts in accordance with their specifications.\nGenesis and Need of Judicial Infrastructure in India\n\nEven before he assumed office, CJI Ramana initially put up the concept for such an organization in March of this year. A survey of 6,000 trial courts in different states was conducted as part of the CJI\u2019s work on the National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation (NJIC) shortly after he was sworn in.\n\nThe main goal of NJIC is to keep state governments from having undue influence over HC chief justices, who frequently work on infrastructure-related projects in trial courts. The NJIC will be an \u201chonest\u201d organization that will keep an eye on how the job being paid for with cash is being carried out.\n\nTo Manage the Funds:\nOf a total of Rs. 981.98 crores sanctioned in 2019-20 under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) to the States and Union Territories for the development of infrastructure in the courts, only Rs. 84.9 crores was utilized by a combined five States, rendering the remaining 91.36% funds unused.\nThe issue has plagued the Indian judiciary for nearly three decades since the CSS was introduced in 1993-94.\nManage a Rising Number of Litigations:\nThe Indian judiciary\u2019s infrastructure\u00a0has not kept pace with the sheer number of litigations\u00a0instituted every year.\nA point cemented by the fact that the\u00a0total sanctioned strength of judicial officers in the country\u00a0is 24,280, but the number of court halls available is just 20,143, including 620 rented halls.\nGreater Autonomy:\nThe improvement and maintenance of judicial infrastructure are still being carried out in an ad-hoc and unplanned manner.\nThe need for \u201cfinancial autonomy of the judiciary\u201d and the creation of the NJIAI will work as a central agency with a degree of autonomy.\nHow would National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation resolve the crisis?\nSpeedy implementation:\u00a0The\u00a0National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation (NJIC)would act as a coordinating agency to speed up the works.\nEnd bureaucratic hurdles: It would include the CJI, judges of the Supreme Court, and high courts, finance secretaries of the Centre, and states concerned. It can quickly end bureaucratic hurdles and challenges of coordination amongst multiple bodies.\nEnsuring a smooth funding process: The proposed body is intended to monitor and address the issues of delay in land allotment, funds diversion for non-judicial purposes, and evasion of responsibilities by the high courts and trial courts, amongst others.\n\nIn India, the judicial infrastructure really needs a big push. In this regard, the NJIC can make critical interventions in key issues which are responsible for poor infrastructure and can open the doors for speedy resolution.\n\nWay Forward\nThe courts in India\u00a0had repeatedly upheld the rights and freedoms of individuals and\u00a0stood up\u00a0whenever individuals or society were at the receiving end of executive excesses.\nIf we want a different outcome from the judicial system, we cannot continue to work in these circumstances.\nInstitutionalizing the mechanism for augmenting and creating state-of-the-art judicial infrastructure is the best gift we can give to our people and our country in this 75th\u00a0year of our Independence.\nThe CSS Scheme will\u00a0increase the availability of well-equipped Court Halls and Residential Accommodations\u00a0for Judges/Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts all over the country.\nSetting up digital computer rooms will also improve digital capabilities and give impetus to the digitization initiation being pursued as a part of India\u2019s\u00a0Digital India vision.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

ST is only allowed in the districts with the highest percentage of Scheduled Tribe residents.\nThe Delimitation Commission considers two factors when deciding how to divide up Scheduled Castes.\nIt chooses congressional districts where the population of Scheduled Castes is more prevalent.\nHowever, it also disperses these constituencies across the State\u2019s various regions.\nBecause the population of Scheduled Castes is typically distributed evenly across the nation, this is done.\nEvery time the Delimitation exercise is carried out, these reserved constituencies can be switched out.\nOther underprivileged groups are not similarly protected by the Constitution.\nFunctions of the Delimitation Commission\n\nThe Delimitation Commission is a powerful organisation, and its decisions are binding. Its decisions cannot be contested in court. The copies of the orders are presented to the Lok Sabha and the relevant legislative assemblies, but no modifications are allowed.\n\nThe Delimitation Commission must choose the number and boundaries of the constituencies in such a way that, as practically possible, the population of each seat is the same.\nThe Commission also specifies which seats in areas with sizable scheduled castes and scheduled tribes population are to be reserved for those communities.\nIf there is disagreement among the Commission members, the decision of the majority will be considered.\nThe Commission publishes draught proposals for public comment in regional language newspapers as well as the Indian Gazette and official state gazetted.\nAdditionally, it holds open meetings where the general public can voice their opinions orally or in writing.\nThe draught proposal is amended if deemed necessary.\nThe final order is published in the Gazettes and takes effect on the day that the President specifies.\nDuties of the Delimitation Commission\n\nOn the basis of the most recent population census data, the Commission shall be responsible for readjusting the representation of the various territorial constituencies in the House of the People and of the various territorial constituencies in the Legislative Assembly of each state.\n\nDelimitation Commission \u2013 Significance\nThe Delimitation Commission of India has been regarded as having absolute jurisdiction, and any court or piece of legislation can never overturn a decision made by this commission.\nHowever, it has been demonstrated that these instructions from the Indian Delimitation Commission are being followed as of a specific date provided by the Indian President.\nA legislatively supported body that functions independently of the executive branch and political parties is the Delimitation Commission.\nTo ensure that the population is roughly equal throughout all constituencies, it establishes the number and boundaries of constituencies.\nIdentifies seats in areas with a significant population that are reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\nDelimitation Commission \u2013 Criticism\nStates that don\u2019t care about population control might end up with more seats in the House of Representatives. States in the South that supported family planning ran the risk of having fewer seats available.\nThe number of seats in the Assemblies and Parliament that were decided upon in 1971 remained the same despite delimitation being done in 2008 based on the 2001 census.\nIn accordance with the constitution, there are a maximum of 550 Lok Sabha seats and 250 Rajya Sabha seats, respectively, and growing populations are each represented by a single representative.\nWay Forward\nAnother amendment has delayed this until 2026, even though the number of Lok Sabha and Assembly seats should have been unfrozen following the 2001 Census.\nThis was justified on the grounds that by 2026, there would be a uniform population growth rate across the nation.\nA national consensus exercise should be started in order to resolve issues before 2026.\nThe Finance Commission\u2019s weighting of the population can be lowered to 10% or even 5%.\nThe strength of the Lok Sabha is anticipated to increase from 543 to 888 when parliamentary constituency boundaries are redrawn, according to data from the 2011 Census. The Rajya Sabha could have 384 members instead of the current 245.\nConclusion\n\nThe Indian government established the Delimitation Commission of India, also referred to as the Boundary Commission of India, in accordance with the Delimitation Commission Act. The commission\u2019s main duty is to redraw the boundaries of each assembly and Lok Sabha seat in light of a recent census.\n\nAlthough it was anticipated that the limit on the number of Lok Sabha and Assemblies seats would be lifted after the 2001 Census, an amendment delayed it until 2026. This was supported by the prediction that by 2026, the nation\u2019s population growth rate would be uniform.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

In this system, the political party that garnered the most votes and the majority of seats in the House of Parliament during the general election takes office as the ruling party.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court, the Constitution is based on the British parliamentary system, where the administration is thought to be primarily responsible for formulating governmental policy and ensuring that it is passed into law by maintaining the Lok Sabha\u2019s trust.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe central government\u2019s parliamentary system is outlined in Articles 74 and 75.\nThe parliamentary system is provided for the states under Articles 163 and 164.\nThe executives under this system sit in the legislature because they are lawmakers, unlike the Presidential system.\nAs long as the lower house of the legislature supports them, executives can use their authority and continue serving in their positions.\nFeatures of the Parliamentary System\nThe real executive and the nominal executive are the two executives. The real executive is the Prime Minister, who is the head of government, not the head of state (president or monarch).\nRule by the party that has the majority in the Lok Sabha.\nThe cornerstone of the parliamentary system of government is collective responsibility (Art. 75) to the Lok Sabha.\nOnly for Lok Sabha, no-confidence vote (cannot introduce in Rajya Sabha )\nPolitical homogeneity is provided. Shared party affiliation and ideologies.\nMinisters have dual membership in the legislative and executive branches.\nA minister loses their position if they are absent from the Parliament for six months in a row\nThe length of the government\u2019s tenure depends on whether it has a majority in the lower chamber. The council of ministers must resign if a motion of no confidence in the government is unsuccessful. A new administration will be formed after the elections.\nThe Prime Minister is in charge of this system of government. The PM is often chosen from among the leaders of the parties that gain a majority in the lower chamber.\nA close working relationship exists between the legislature and the executive in this situation. The Parliament is legislative, and the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers make up the executive. Since the members of parliament chose the prime minister and the ministries, it appears that the executive branch is derived from the legislature.\nMerits\nBetter coordination between the executive and the legislature: Since the executive is a part of the legislature and the majority of lawmakers often support the government, passing legislation and putting them into effect is made easier.\nThere is no authoritarianism since the executive is answerable to the legislative and subject to a motion of no confidence. Furthermore, power is not centralised like it is under the presidential government.\nInclusive and participatory decision-making\nResponsible government. The Parliament holds ministers accountable for their actions.\nDiscussions, a motion for adjournment, and a motion for no confidence are all used as tools.\nPrepare an alternative government in the event that the majority dissents.\nUnder this arrangement, the parliament provides representation to the nation\u2019s many groups.\nThis is particularly significant for a nation like India.\nThe system is flexible because it is simple to replace the PM when necessary. Winston Churchill succeeded Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister of Great Britain during the Second World War. This is in contrast to the presidential system, where a president can only be removed if impeached or after serving the term.\n\nAlso Read :Parliamentary Committees in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha \u2013 Clear IAS\n\nDemerits\nCabinet-level dictatorship. The government is headed by the prime minister.\nMinisters may not be subject matter experts.\nPM has few options when choosing ministers\nCivil officials have a lot of power. They provide advice to the ministers on a variety of issues and are not accountable to the legislature.\nParliamentary government is susceptible to non-constitutional pressures.\nNo consistency in the policies. Changes in the government are typically followed by changes in the government\u2019s policy.\nThe absence of a true separation of powers makes it impossible for the legislative always to hold the executive accountable. If the government holds a sizable majority in the house, this is particularly true\nAdditionally, lawmakers are unable to employ their free will and cast votes in accordance with their beliefs and understanding due to anti-defection laws. They must adhere to the party line.\nThere is instability if there is no clear winner after the elections since governments can only last as long as they can demonstrate a majority in the parliament. Coalition governments typically have a limited lifespan and are highly unstable. As a result, the administration must concentrate on maintaining power rather than worrying about the welfare or state of the populace.\nThe system produces lawmakers with the sole goal of advancing to the executive branch. They lack the necessary qualifications to pass laws.\nThe Council of Ministers frequently delays making big, long-term policy choices because it has no fixed tenure.\n\nAlso Read: Parliamentary Committees in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha \u2013 Clear IAS\n\nDifference between the Parliamentary System of Britain and India\nBritish parliamentary system\nThe ruler is a monarch who was not chosen by the populace.\nIt is a sovereign body, the parliament.\nThe lower house includes the Prime Minister.\nMinisters are held accountable by the law.\nThey have a clause that allows the opposition to form a shadow cabinet.\nIndian parliamentary system\nThe people chose the Republic as their leader.\nThe powers of the parliament are constrained.\nAny of the house\u2019s members may serve as the prime minister.\nMinisters are not subject to any legal obligations.\n\nAlso read: Types of Majorities Used in the Indian Parliament \u2013 Absolute, Effective, Simple, and Special Majority\n\nReasons for adopting the parliamentary system in India\nThe constitution\u2019s drafters correctly chose the parliamentary model. The causes of it are found in both India\u2019s socio-political system and its political legacy from colonial times. The following are the causes of this:\nIndia had considerable experience with the parliamentary system prior to the constitution\u2019s drafting thanks to the Government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935. Indians were therefore aware of it.\nThis event also demonstrated that the people\u2019s representatives can effectively control the executives.\nThe constitution\u2019s authors intended for the government to be answerable to and responsive to the needs of the people.\nBecause the presidential system provides the president tremendous power and allows him to function independently of the legislature, its creators were hesitant to adopt it.\nThe personality cult of the president is another weakness of the presidential system.\nThe authors of the constitution aimed to avoid the possibility of a personality cult by creating a strong executive branch with robust checks and balances.\nThere are various processes in the parliamentary system that increase the executive\u2019s accountability to and control over the representatives of the people.\nTherefore, a parliamentary system was approved by the constitution of India.\nConclusion\n\nParliament is a key component of our democracy since it serves as the representative body that scrutinises the actions of the administration. In order for Parliament to serve its constitutional mission, good operation is essential. A careful analysis of bills is also a crucial element of effective legislation. Legislation is passed without consulting legislative committees, undermining democracy.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

The effectiveness of an organization can be improved with the use of social audits.\n\nIt encourages effective leadership and strengthens supervision and accountability.\n\nThis can help you bridge the gap between your ideal situation and the actual situation, as well as between effectiveness and efficiency.\nIt gives us the ability to evaluate, confirm, document, and improve the social effects of any government effort or organisation.\n\nA social audit and a development audit are not the same things. A social audit focuses on the frequently ignored subject of social consequences, whereas a development audit has a broader focus that includes environmental and economic issues, such as the effectiveness of a project or programme.\n\nOrigin of Social Audit in India\n\nThe first organisation in India to conduct social audits was Tata Iron and Steel Company Ltd. (TISCO), Jamshedpur, in 1979.\n\nIt gained significance with the 73rd amendment to the constitution, which addressed Panchayat Raj institutions.\n\nThe 9th FYP (2002-07) approach paper laid a strong focus on social audit for the efficient operation of Panchayat Raj institutions and gave grama sabhas the authority to perform Social Audits\u00a0in addition to their other duties.\n\nThe National Rural Employment Guarantee Act of 2005 stipulates that \u201cSocial Audits\u201d must be conducted on a regular basis to maintain the program\u2019s accountability and openness.\n\nObjectives of Social Audit\nPrevents the misuse of both funds and authority.\nMoreover, it strengthens an organization\u2019s social performance.\nProper financial management in accordance with the budget.\nTo make the development programme more successful and efficient.\nTo promote both organisational and public participation in social programmes.\nPrinciples of Social Audit\n\nFrom social auditing methods used all across the world, some distinct basic principles have been found, these are as follows:\n\nTransparency: Complete openness in the administration and decision-making processes, with a duty on the part of the government to proactively provide the public with unrestricted access to all pertinent information.\nAccountability: Immediate and open accountability of elected officials and other government employees to all parties involved and impacted by their relevant actions or inactions.\nParticipation: the right-based participation in the process of decision-making and validation of all the affected individuals, not just their representatives.\nRepresentative Participation: The right of the affected parties to provide informed consent as a group or an individual, as appropriate, in situations when options are predetermined out of necessity.\nComprehensive Report: Report in detail on every facet of the organization\u2019s performance and activities.\nRegular-based: Create social accounts on a regular basis to ensure that the idea and the practise are ingrained throughout the entire organization\u2019s culture.\nComparative: Provide a way for the organisation to compare its performance to industry benchmarks and the performance of other organisations.\nVerified: Social accounts are audited by a qualified individual or organisation that has no financial stake in the organisation.\n\nAlso read: Indian Companies Act 2013: Salient Features\n\nSignificance of Social Audit\nDiscover Malpractices: It keeps a careful eye on government activities and reveals anomalies and malpractices in the public sector, eradicating leaks and corruption.\nMonitoring and Feedback: It evaluates a company\u2019s social and ethical impact and offers proper feedback on its operations.\nAccountability and Transparency: It fills the trust gap between residents and local governments by ensuring that local government bodies are accountable and transparent in their operations.\nParticipatory: It stimulates and increases their openness to social participation in the development of programmes. Social Audit gives more voice to Gram Sabha, the cornerstone of rural administration.\nDesigning Policies: Establishing demands in a socially responsible and accountable manner by identifying real issues serves as the basis for designing policies.\nEnhances Professionalism: By mandating Panchayats to maintain sufficient records and reports of expenditures made with financing from the government and other sources, It enhances the professionalism of the public sector.\nChallenges Associated with Social Audit\nRules not followed: In several states, Gram Panchayats are not required to provide Social Audit Units with records pertaining to work completion and expenditures, and Gram Sabhas are not provided with social audit reports in their native tongues.\nLack of Independency: Many governments do not adhere to the transparent selection procedure for the director of the Social Audit Units as specified in the requirements. Several Social Audit Units do not have enough personnel to cover all of the panchayats even once a year.\nNot Institutionalised: Auditors are subject to implementing agencies that face resistance and intimidation and struggle to even get access to original data for verification because the government has not regulated the institutionalisation of Social Audit.\n\u00a0Lack of Stringent Penalty: Because there are no fines or legal repercussions for breaking rules and guidelines, Social Audit is a pointless endeavour.\nInadequate Knowledge: Due to unawareness, members of the Gram Sabha are unaware of their legal entitlement to social audits.\nLack of an Intelligent Information System: Government agencies rely on an ambiguous and imprecise system of referencing government accounts and government reporting methods to track the progress of a plan, making it challenging for auditors to take stock, accelerate, decelerate, or implement corrective actions.\nNo Incentive to Participate: The lack of participation in village activities is a result of people\u2019s worries about their livelihood.\nSteps\u00a0 To Be Taken\nCreating Citizens Groups: The political administration and implementing agencies must be held to account by citizens\u2019 groups, who must fight for the improvement of social auditing.\nEstablishing an Expert Group: A group of social audit specialists should be established to instruct the social audit committee members.\nConduct Training Programmes: It is important to create training programmes on social auditing practises like conducting and writing reports, as well as presenting at Gram Sabha.\nParticipation in Civil Society: It should be promoted that individuals, including students from various universities, take part as Village Resource Persons. As an illustration, Jharkhand established a formal system by inviting well-known members of civil society to join the Social Audit panel.\nSystem Institutionalising: For the system of social audits to become an institutionalised structure that cannot be challenged by vested interests, it needs widespread support and encouragement from several authorities.\nSupport for Implementing Agencies: Rules that mandate implementing agencies to participate in the social audit process and act fast on the findings must be established.\n\u00a0Legally Sanctioned Results: State governments should set up specific rules to make sure that social audit results are legally sanctioned.\nUtilizing\u00a0 Management Information System: The planning, implementation, and feedback phases of a program\u2019s life cycle are streamlined by using MIS to track specifics of schemes at all levels.\nPunitive Action for Non-compliance: The state government should take swift action to identify the responsible parties and to punish defective SAU employees as well as other ground-level auditors.\nMonitoring : The implementing agency\u2019s response to the social audit findings, or lack thereof, should be observed by the Ministry of Rural Development. A quarterly meeting between SAU, the implementing agencies, and MoRD officials should be convened to monitor the action-taken reports.\nIncreasing the Frequency: It must be conducted by each Gram Panchayat once every six months.\nRole of Media: The media\u2019s role is to reach rural communities and raise awareness through specially crafted programmes that concentrate on matters of rural concern, particularly Gram Sabhas and their capacity for social audit.\nSocial Audit Law\n\nMeghalaya was the first state in India to implement the Meghalaya Community Participation and Public Services Social Audit Act, 2017.\n\nElements of the Act:\nA social audit facilitator will be recruited to carry out the audit directly with the people who will submit findings to the Gram Sabha, which will then add inputs and ultimately send the outcome to the auditors.\nThe Social Audit Council (SAC), a council, has been established to assess government projects as they are implemented.\nThe Act includes a list of the projects, programmes, and schemes that need to be audited.\nBest Practises for Social Audit\n\nSome of the best practices include the following\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh, the Society for Social Audit, Accountability and Transparency was established as an independent organisation free from intervention from the government.\n\nIn terms of implementing SA, the state of Andhra Pradesh has emerged as a model for all other states.\n\nIts main objective is to uphold the idea of the populace\u2019s constant vigilance, which is made easier by the collaboration of social activists and the government.\n\nIt seeks to both prevent leakage and waste of public funds while empowering rural residents who are beneficiaries of social programmes like MGNREGA.\n\nPublic vigilance, verification of various implementation stages, and \u201cSocial Audit Forums-Public Hearings\u201d are all parts of the SSAAT\u2019s social audit process.\n\nJharkhand\n\nJuries made up of representatives from CSOs and Panjayathi raj institutions hear public hearings.\n\nA recommendation for action to be made in response to specific anomalies has been developed for the jury members\u2019 input.\n\nHearings are held at the panchayat, block, district, and state levels.\n\nThere are specialised audits and tests conducted.\n\nFor IEC activities, a cultural workshop was held, and songs in eight different languages were composed.\n\nChattisgarh\n\nThe Gram Sabha\u2019s Sachiv and Sarpanch receive complaints from the social audit team regarding matters other than MGNREGA and deliver them to them.\n\nTo guarantee active community engagement in the social audit process, muster rolls, bills, and measuring books are written on the wall.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe need for a social audit is essential. Due to its wider breadth and similarity to financial and operational audits, this is a useful tool for giving society and stakeholders assurance.\n\nGlobal experience with Social Audits is encouraging despite its shortcomings. The Andhra Pradesh Government\u2019s endeavour is a milestone in this field.\n\nSuch inspections and comments are very helpful in identifying the gap between what people need and what they get through social programmes.\n\nArticle written\u00a0by: Aryadevi E S"

Indian constitution also divides the legislative power between the centre and states with respect to both territories and the subjects of legislation.\n\nThere are four aspects of the legislative relationships between the union and the states:\n\nTerritorial extent of central and state legislation\nDistribution of legislative subjects\nParliamentary legislation in the state field\nCentre\u2019s control over state legislation\nTerritorial Extent of Central and State Legislation\n\nThe ability to pass legislation that covers all or a portion of India\u2019s territory belongs to Parliament (territory includes union, state, UT)\n\nLaws can be passed by the state legislature that is applicable to the entire state or only a portion of it. Unless there is a sufficient connection\n\nbetween the state and the object, state laws are not applicable outside of the state.\n\nThe only body with the power to pass \u201cextraterritorial\u201d legislation is Parliament.\n\nSituations where parliamentary laws aren\u2019t applicable in the following areas:\n\nThe President has the authority to enact rules that have the same force and effect as laws passed by parliament for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Ladakh and Lakshadweep.\nGovernor is empowered to direct that an act of Parliament does not apply to scheduled areas in the state or apply with specified modifications and exceptions.\nDistribution of Legislative Subjects\n\nThe Union List, State List, and Concurrent List are the three divisions established by the constitution.\n\nParliament is the exclusive authority when it comes to the Union list.\n\nIn most cases, the state legislature alone has the power to pass legislation pertaining to the things on the state list.\n\nThe state and federal governments can both pass laws on the subjects mentioned in the concurrent list.\n\nThe ability to pass laws with a recurring theme rest with Parliament.\n\nThe concurrent list is given precedence over the state list, and the union list is given precedence over the state list.\n\nThe power to make laws with respect to residuary subjects is vested in the Parliament.\n\nParliamentary Legislation in the State Field\nThe Constitution permits Parliament to enact laws on any topic included in the state list under the following five exceptional circumstances:\nWhen Rajya Sabha approves a resolution with the support of two-thirds of the members present and voting, it will provide parliament with the authority to enact legislation on a state list issue that is best for the nation. Such a resolution lasts for a full year. A resolution like this can be renewed a number of times, but not for more than a year at a time. The laws passed in accordance with the resolution cease to be in force six months after it was adopted. In the event of a disagreement between state and union legislation, the latter prevails. A state may, however, pass legislation on the same issue.\nWhen a declaration of a National emergency is in force the Parliament may pass laws on any matter covered by the state list. The legislation passed under this are only valid for six months before they expire.\u00a0State law may also enact legislation on the matter, but in the event of a conflict, union law will take precedence.\nWhen a state makes a request to Parliament to act on a list of issues by passing a resolution to that effect, Parliament is given the power to do so. The state forfeits all rights there once this resolution is approved.\u00a0To implement International Agreements, the parliament can make laws on any matter in the state list for implementing International Treaties, agreements and conventions.\nWhen President\u2019s Rule is imposed in a state, the parliament becomes empowered to make laws with respect to any matter in the State List.\nCentre\u2019s Control Over State Legislation\n\nAccording to the Constitution, the federal government is authorised to exercise the following influence over state legislative affairs:\n\nSpecific laws established by the state legislature may be set aside by the governor for presidential consideration. They are entirely under the president\u2019s power.\nBills on specified subjects listed in the state list can only be filed in the state legislature with the President\u2019s prior consent. For instance, interstate trade and commerce.\nThe President may ask a state to lay aside money bills and other financial bills for his consideration in the case of a financial emergency.\nAdministrative Relations\n\nThe distribution of legislative authority has resulted in a shared executive branch between the federal government and the states.\n\nArticle 256 to 263 of the constitution deals with the administrative relation between the Centre and States.\n\nDistribution of Executive Powers\n\nThe centre\u2019s power encompasses the entire nation when it comes to matters over which it has exclusive jurisdiction (union list), as well as when it exercises any rights, jurisdiction, or authority granted to it by a treaty or agreement.\n\nThe subjects listed in the state list fall under the state\u2019s purview.\n\nThe states have the executive authority in matters involving the concurrent list.\n\nThe state\u2019s executive branch must act in a way that ensures the laws established by Parliament are upheld.\n\nA state\u2019s executive power may not be interfered with or affected in any way.\n\nThe Obligation of States and the Centre\n\nThe constitution has placed two restrictions on the executive power of the states in order to give ample scope to the centre for exercising its executive power in an unrestricted manner.\n\nThe state\u2019s executive branch must act in a way that ensures the laws established by Parliament are upheld.\nAs not to prejudice the executive power of the centre in the state.\n\nIn both cases, the executive power of the Centre extends to giving such directions to the state as are necessary for the purpose.\n\nThe sanction behind these directions of the Centre is coercive in nature.\n\nThus, Article 365 says that where any state has failed to comply with any directions given by the Centre, it will be lawful for the President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. It means that, in such a situation, the President\u2019s rule can be imposed in the state under Article 356.\n\nCentre\u2019s Direction to the States\n\nIn Centre-State Relations, the following circumstances are where the Centre may provide advice to states:\n\nConstruction and maintenance of communication systems deemed to be of national or military importance by the government.\n\nActions to be taken to guarantee the state\u2019s railways are safe.\n\nProvision of enough resources for students from linguistic minority groups to receive elementary school instruction in their home tongue.\n\nThe creation and execution of specific initiatives for the ST\u2019s welfare in the various states.\n\nMutual Delegation of Functions\n\nTo decrease rigidity and prevent a deadlock, the constitution permits intergovernmental delegation of executive authorities.\n\nWith the state government\u2019s approval, the president may delegate the union\u2019s executive functions to it.\n\nThe governor may delegate the executive responsibilities of the state to the union with the approval of the federal government.\n\nThis agreement to share authority may be either conditional or unconditional.\n\nThe constitution also permits the state to provide the union executive authority without the state\u2019s consent.\n\nBut such delegations are made by Parliament, not by the President. The executive authority of a state, however, cannot be transferred in the same manner.\n\nCooperation Between Centre and States\n\nThe following provisions have been included to ensure cooperation and coordination between the centre and the states.\n\nParliament has the authority to rule on any dispute or grievance involving the use, distribution, and management of any interstate river\u2019s and river valleys\u2019 water resources.\n\nThe President has the power to convene an inter-state council to examine and deliberate on subjects of common interest between the centre and the states.\n\nAll of India is required to provide full faith and credit to the public actions, records, and judicial proceedings of the federal government and each state.\n\nIn order to carry out the constitutional requirements relating to interstate trade, commerce, and intercourse, Parliament has the authority to designate the proper authorities.\n\nAll India Services\n\nIn 1947, the colonial Indian Civil Service (ICS) and Indian Police (IP) were replaced by the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Police Service (IPS).\n\nAs the third all-India service in the nation, the Indian Forest Service (IFS) was founded in 1966.\n\nThe members of All India Services occupy the top positions under both the Centre and States. But they are recruited and trained by the centre.\n\nThe ultimate control lies with the central government while immediate control vests with the state governments.\n\nArticle 312 of the Indian constitution gives Parliament the authority to create an all-India service provided the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to that effect.\n\nWith the combination of these three services, a single service is created with uniform pay schedules, rights, and status.\n\nAll India Services is required for:\n\nAssist in maintaining the federal government and the states\u2019 administrative standards high.\nAid in ensuring that the administrative framework is consistent throughout the nation.\nThey enhance communication, collaboration, coordination, and cooperative action between the federal government and the states on issues of shared concern.\nPublic Service Commission\n\nThe centre-state relationships in this area are as follows:\n\nThe state public service commission\u2019s chairman and members are chosen by the governor, but only the president has the authority to remove them.\nThe President appoints the chairman and members of the state public service commission in cases when two or more states request that Parliament establish a combined public service commission.\nThe President\u2019s approval is required for UPSC to help the state public service commission at the governor\u2019s request.\nIn order to create and implement joint recruiting plans for any services that require candidates with certain qualifications, the UPSC works with the states.\nIntegrated Judicial System\n\nDespite its dual polity, India has built an integrated judicial system.\n\nThis unified judicial system is in charge of enforcing both federal and state laws.\n\nThe judges of a high court are appointed by the President of India, in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the governor of the state.\n\nThe President has the power to transfer or remove them.\n\nParliament has approved the creation of joint high courts for two or more states.\n\nRelation During Emergency\n\nDuring a national emergency, The centre has the authority to provide directives to the state on any matter.\n\nThe State governments are brought under the complete control of the centre, though, they are not suspended.\n\nWhen President Rule is imposed in a state, the president may exercise the duties and authority vested in him and powers vested in the governor or any other administrative authority in the state.\n\nDuring a Financial Emergency, The President may also give other crucial orders, such as lowering the salaries of high court judges and state personnel. The centre may require states to abide by financial propriety canons.\n\nFinancial Relations\n\nArticle 268 to 293 of the constitution deals with Centre-State Financial Relations.\n\nAllocation of Taxing Power\nTaxation of the subjects on the Union list is the sole responsibility of Parliament.\nTaxation on the things included in the state list may only be done by the state legislature.\nThe items on the concurrent list are subject to taxation by both the state and the union.\nThe residuary power to tax belongs to the Parliament.\nThe Constitutional Restriction on The State\u2019s Taxation Power\n\nThe power to tax occupations, trades, callings, and professions belongs to the state legislature. However, no one should receive more than Rs 2500 in total compensation each year.\n\nTaxes on the sale or purchase of products can be imposed by a state (other than a newspaper). However, The following factors restrict the state\u2019s capacity to impose a sales tax:\n\nSales and purchases made outside of the states are exempt from taxation\nSales or purchases done during the import or export process are exempt from taxation.\nNo tax may be levied on a transaction or purchase made during interstate trade or commerce.\nA tax imposed on goods sold or bought that the Parliament has determined are of particular importance to interstate trade and commerce is subject to the limitations and specifications set forth by the Parliament.\n\nElectricity used by or sold to the centre, as well as electricity used in the building, upkeep, or operation of any railway by or sold to the railway company for the same purpose, are exempt from state taxes.\n\nA state may charge a price for the water or electricity it sells to an interstate river authority that Parliament established to manage and develop the river. On the other hand, a law that receives the approval of the President may enact such an imposition.\n\nDistribution of Tax Revenues\n\nTaxes are levied by the centre, but they are collected and used by the state (Article 268). The state\u2019s consolidated fund receives the proceeds from this and holds them there. For instance, excise tax and stamp duty.\n\nArticle 269). One illustration would be taxes imposed on goods purchased or sold in interstate commerce.\n\nThe state\u2019s consolidated fund receives the proceeds from this and holds them there.\n\nAlthough the federal government imposes and collects taxes, they are divided between the federal government and the states (Article 270). This category includes all taxes, with the exception of the ones mentioned above, surcharges, and cess. Based on the Finance Commission\u2019s recommendations, the President determines how these taxes are divided.\n\nThe tax and levies surcharges mentioned in Articles 269 and 270 may be enacted at any time by Parliament. Proceeds from the surcharge are only used for the centre.\n\nState-imposed gathered, and held-back taxes consist of:\n\nThese are the taxes that fall under the purview of the states only.\nThey are listed on the state list.\nAgriculture income taxes, Alcohol excise taxes, Profession-specific taxes, Ceilings, etc.\nDistribution of Non-Tax Revenues\n\nThe centre\u2019s primary non-tax revenue sources are as follows:\n\nPostal and telegraph services\nRailroads\nBanking\nBroadcasting\nCoinage and currency\nCentral public sector enterprise\nEscheat and lapse.\n\nThe main sources of non-tax revenue for states are as follows:\n\nIrrigation\nForests\nFisheries\nState public sector enterprise\nEscheat and lapse.\nGrants-in-Aid to the states\n\nState grants-in-aid are permitted by the Constitution to come from the federal government. The two types of grants-in-aid are statutory grants and discretionary grants.\n\nSTATUTORY GRANTS:\n\nThe parliament is empowered by Article 275 of the Constitution to provide grants to states that specifically require them rather than to all states.\n\nThese amounts may vary for various states. These funds are levied annually to the Consolidated Fund of India.\n\nDepending on the Finance Commission\u2019s recommendations, these are given to the states.\n\nDISCRETIONARY GRANTS:\n\nArticle 282 gives both the federal government and the states the authority to provide grants for any public purpose, even if it is not within their purview.\n\nThe choice is entirely up to the centre, which is under no obligation to offer these subsidies.\n\nOther grants:\n\nA one-time donation for a particular cause was permitted by the Constitution. For the states of Assam, Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal, grants on jute and jute products could be used in place of export taxes.\n\nThese funds were to be given out for ten years starting at the time the constitution was adopted, per the recommendation of the Finance Commission.\n\nGoods and Services Tax Council\n\nThe smooth and efficient administration of the goods and services tax ( GST ) requires cooperation and coordination between the Centre and the States.\n\nIn order to facilitate this consultation process, the 101st Amendment Act of 2016 provided for the establishment of a Goods and Services Tax Council or the GST Council.\n\nArticle 279 \u2013 A empowered the President to constitute a GST Council.\n\nThe Council is a joint forum of the Centre and the States. It is required to make recommendations to the Centre and the States on the following matters :\n\nThe taxes, cesses and surcharges levied by the Centre, the States and the local bodies would get merged into GST.\nThe goods and services that may be subjected to GST or exempted from GST.\nModel GST Laws, principles of levy, apportionment of GST levied on supplies in the course of inter-state trade or commerce and the principles that govern the place of supply.\nThe threshold limit of turnover below which goods and services may be exempted from GST.\nThe rates include floor rates with bands of GST.\nAny special rate or rates for a specified period to raise additional resources during any natural calamity or disaster.\n\nRead: Fiscal federalism in India\n\nImportant Recommendations on Centre-State Relations\nAdministrative Reforms Commission\n\u00a0The creation of an interstate council under Article 263 of the constitution\nAppointment of governors with substantial expertise in public service and impartial viewpoints\nThe most power has been granted to states.\nIn order to reduce the state\u2019s reliance on the federal government, more financial resources ought to be distributed to them.\nFederal armed troops are stationed in states at their request or on their own initiative.\nSarkaria Commission Recommendations\nSetting up a permanent inter-State Council under Article 263\nArticle 356 should only be utilized when necessary.\nThe all-India service institution needs to be strengthened.\nThe residuary power of taxation should belong to the parliament.\n>The states should be informed of the President\u2019s grounds for his or her vetoes of state legislation.\nWithout the consent of the states, the Center ought to be able to use its military forces. However, it would be ideal if the states were consulted.\nThe centre should consult the states before making law on the subject of concurrent list.\nGovernors should be allowed to complete their five-year terms.\nThe position of Linguistic Minority Commissioner should be filled.\nPunchhi Commission Recommendations\nThe impeachment process is used to remove governors after a five-year tenure.\nThe Union should exercise extreme prudence when asserting Parliamentary precedence in matters given to the states.\nIt specified the number of criteria to be taken into account when choosing governors:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He ought to be well-known in some industries.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He should not be a state resident.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He ought to be a neutral figure who stays out of regional politics.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He shouldn\u2019t have recently become involved in politics.\n\nThe term limit for the government should be set at five years.\nGovernors could be subject to the same impeachment process as the president.\nConclusion\n\nThe interactions between the Center and the States are the primary characteristics of Indian federalism. To safeguard Indian residents\u2019 safety and well-being, the Central Government and State Governments must collaborate with each other. They work together to prevent terrorism, manage families, protect the environment, and prepare for the socioeconomic future. The evolution of the nation has been greatly influenced by these exchanges between the centre and the states. The better Centre-State relations contributed to the improved national government, an improved administrative system, and the integration of disparate communities into society at large.\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S"

Sarkaria, a retired judge of the Supreme Court. Other members of the commission are Shri B. Sivaraman and Dr S.R. Sen.\n\nIt was initially given one year to complete its work, but its term was extended four times, and finally submitted its report in 1988.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPurpose of the Commission\nRecommendations made by Sarkaria Commission\nRecommendations of the Commission Regarding the Inter-State Council\nOther Important Recommendations\nObservations on Administrative Relations\nConclusion\nPurpose of the Commission\n\nThe Sarkaria Commission has given the work to investigate and analyze how the current agreements between the Union and States are operating in terms of powers, functions, and responsibilities in all domains and recommend any necessary changes or additional measures.\n\nThe commission will keep in mind the social and economic developments that have occurred over the years and give appropriate consideration to the scheme and framework of the Constitution that the founding fathers so carefully established to protect the independence and ensure the unity and integrity of the country, which will be examined and reviewed in order to determine the modifications and measures that are needed.\n\nRecommendations made by Sarkaria Commission\n\nThe Commission made 247 recommendations to improve Centre-state relations out of which the Central government has implemented 180 recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission. The most important is the establishment of the Inter-State Council in 1990.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe important recommendations made by Sarkaria Commission regarding Centre-State Relations are mentioned below:\n\nIn accordance with Article 263, a permanent Inter-State Council known as the Inter-Governmental Council should be established.\nArticle 356 (President\u2019s Rule) should only be invoked under the most extreme circumstances and as a final resort if all other options have failed.\nThe institution of All-India Services should be strengthened further, and other services of this type should be established.\nThe residual legislative authority of taxation should remain with the Parliament, while the other residuary powers should be placed in the Concurrent List.\nWhen the president withholds his assent to the state bills, the reasons should be informed to the state government.\nThe National Economic and Development Council (NEDC) should be renamed and reinstituted in its place as the National Development Council (NDC).\nTo foster the spirit of federalism, the zonal councils should be reconstituted and revitalized.\nEven without the consent of states, the Centre should have the authority to send its armed forces into action. However, it would be preferable if the states were consulted.\nBefore passing a law addressing one of the topics on the Concurrent List, the Centre must consult the states.\nThe Constitution itself should lay down the process for consulting the chief minister when appointing a state governor.\nThe net proceeds of the corporation tax may be made permissibly shareable with the states.\nAs long as the council of ministers has a majority in the assembly, the governor cannot dismiss it.\nUnless there are some exceptionally compelling circumstances, a governor\u2019s five-year governorship should not be disrupted.\nA state minister shall not be the subject of an inquiry unless the Parliament specifically demands it.\nThe surcharge on income tax should not be levied by the Centre except for a specific purpose and for a strictly restricted time.\nThe Finance Commission and Planning Commission\u2019s current functional division is appropriate and needs to be maintained.\nMeasures should be adopted to uniformly implement the three-language formula in line with its original intent.\nNo autonomy for radio and television but decentralization in their operations.\nNo change in the role of the Rajya Sabha and the Centre\u2019s power to reorganize the states.\nIt is important to activate the commissioner for linguistic minorities.\nRecommendations of the Commission Regarding the Inter-State Council\nThe Council should be given extensive responsibilities covering all of Article 263\u2019s sections (b) and (c). The Council should not be vested with powers of enquiring into and advising upon disputes between the States;\nWithout an independent permanent secretariat, the Council won\u2019t be able to build its credibility. The Council\u2019s secretariat should be adequately staffed and should be modeled after the Union Cabinet Secretariat given the type of meetings and the level of participants.\nOther Important Recommendations\n\nOther relevant recommendations made by the Sarkaria commission are:\n\nIt strongly implied that Article 370 was not a transitory provision.\u00a0 This appears to have been said in response to \u201cone all-India political organization\u2019 to remove Article 370 \u201cin the interests of national integration.\u201d\nThat the enforcement of Union laws, particularly those relating to the concurrent sphere, is secured through the machinery of the states.\nNormally, the Union should only take up that part of a concurrent topic where uniformity of policy and action is essential for the greater good of the country, leaving the rest and the specifics up to state action.\nObservations on Administrative Relations\n\nSarkaria made the following observation:\n\nFederalism is more a functional arrangement for cooperative action, than a static institutional concept. Article 258 (power of the Union to confer powers etc on states in certain cases) provides a tool by the liberal use of which cooperative federalism can be substantially realized in the working of the system. This mechanism should be used more generously than it has in the past in order to gradually decentralize power to the governments of the states.\nIt was advised that Article 356 be used \u201cextremely sparingly, in exceptional circumstances, as a measure of last resort, when all other possibilities fail to prevent or rectify a breakdown of constitutional machinery in the state.\nConclusion\n\nThe Commission opposed structural changes and believed that the institutions\u2019 current constitutional provisions and guiding principles were basically sound. However, it focused on the necessity for adjustments to the operational or functional aspects. It noted that federalism is more of a functional arrangement for cooperative action than a static institutional concept.\n\nIt is noted that a\u00a0 strong Center is necessary to protect the nation\u2019s unity and integrity, which are being threatened by the body politic\u2019s fissiparous tendencies. It explicitly rejected the call for the powers of the Centre to be reduced. It did not, however, associate a strong center with a concentration of power.\n\nIn conclusion, it should be emphasized that the Indian Constitution combines both federal and unitary principles.\u00a0 It is a Union or composite State of a novel type.\u00a0 It supports the idea that \u201cthe national interest should take precedence despite federalism.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

One-party systems, such as the Soviet Union, are examples.\n\n(ii) A two-party system based on the existence of two major parties.

Examples of multi-party systems include Switzerland, France, and India.\n\nAim: They keep the public informed about those who speak for them in both the government and the opposition.\n\nConstitutional Status: Political parties continue to be the backbone of Indian politics despite being extra-constitutional.\n\nRead:\u00a0Political party system\n\nHistorical Background\nThe Congress Party dominated Indian politics from 1952 to 1964 when the country\u2019s democracy was essentially a one-party system known as the \u201cCongress system.\u201d\nJawahar Lal Nehru\u2019s passing and the 1967 elections brought about a challenge to the dominance of the Congress system. The majority held by Congress in the Lok Sabha was down to 54% of the seats as a result of losing majorities in eight states. Around the nation, regional parties started to proliferate.\nA new coalition headed by the Janata Party emerged in 1977. This led to the creation of a multi-party system in India. Instead of coming to an ideological understanding, several smaller parties joined forces to take on Congress.\nThere has been a multi-party system and coalition politics since 1989.\nHow many political parties are in India?\n\nSeveral hundred political parties are officially registered in India as of 2021. However, there are significantly fewer parties that are actually active and have a sizable presence at the federal or state level. There are currently 7 recognised national parties and 49 recognised state parties in India, according to the Election Commission of India.\n\nThe seven recognized national parties in India are:\n\nIndian National Congress (INC)\nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\nCommunist Party of India (CPI)\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM)\nNationalist Congress Party (NCP)\nBahujan Samaj Party (BSP)\nAll India Trinamool Congress (AITC)\n\nNumerous other lesser-known parties also participate in elections at the federal, state, and local levels in addition to these officially recognised ones. While some of these parties are based on particular ideologies or areas, others are concentrated on particular communities or groups.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that India has a multi-party system, which prevents any one party from winning a majority on its own and frequently results in coalition governments being formed after elections.\n\nEligibility For Status Of Political Party\n\nA party is recognized as a State Party if any of the following requirements are met:\n\nIf it receives at least 6% of the valid votes cast in a general election for the state\u2019s Legislative Assembly or Lok Sabha, as well as at least 1 seat in the Legislative Assembly or 2 seats in the Lok Sabha.\nIf it prevails in a general election held to the Lok Sabha or Legislative Assembly of a state with at least 8% of all valid votes cast.\nIf it wins three legislative seats, three per cent of the state\u2019s legislative assembly seats, or at least three per cent of those seats.\nIf it wins at least one Lok Sabha seat out of the 25 that are allotted to the States.\nCurrently, the Election Commission has designated 64 political parties as State Political Parties.\n\nA party is recognized as a National Political Party (NPP) if a full fills any of the following conditions:\n\nIf it receives at least 6% of the valid votes cast in an election for the Lok Sabha or the State\u2019s Legislative Assembly in 4 or more states, in addition to at least 4 seats in the Lok Sabha from 1 or more states.\nIf it receives at least 8% of the valid votes cast in a general election for the Lok Sabha or state legislature held in four or more states.\nIf it receives votes from three or more states for at least 2% of the Lok Sabha\u2019s total seats.\nCurrently, the Election Commission has designated 8 political parties as National Political Parties.\nLatest NPP: The National People\u2019s Party (NPP), the first regional party from the northeast to receive this honour, has been named India\u2019s eighth national party by the Election Commission of India.\nFunctions Of Political Parties In India\n\nPolitical parties in India serve several functions, including:\n\nThey nominate candidates for elections.\nThe effort to increase support for their candidates for office.\nThey use manifestos to present voters with their plans and policies.\nElection results determine who forms the government and who enacts and implements policies. Election results determine who forms the government and who enacts and implements policies.\nThe opposition is formed by those who are not in power and keep the government in check.\nThey form an opposition and put constant pressure on the executive branch for good governance when they are in the minority in the legislature.\nThey help form and mould public opinion by educating the general public.\nThey communicate the demands of the populace to the government.\n\nAdditionally, political parties in India play a crucial role in shaping public opinion and influencing the political discourse in the country. They also serve as a means for citizens to express their views and participate in the democratic process.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn India, political parties are essential to the operation of the democratic system. The political landscape of the nation is, however, beset by some problems. To guarantee intra-party democracy and financial transparency, it is past time to de-communalize political parties and constitutionalize them.\n\nNo single party can win a majority in India\u2019s multi-party system on its own, and coalition governments are frequently formed after elections.

It is critical to address this disparity in order to ensure equitable access to justice.\n\nJustices Hima Kohli and Bela M Trivedi have been appointed to the bench by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud. The Supreme Court first had an all-female bench in 2013; the next time was in 2018.\n\nAt the moment, only three of the Supreme Court\u2019s 27 judges (out of a total of 34) are women.

According to data from the National Judicial Data Grid, as of December 2020, women make up approximately 11% of the total number of judges at the district court level, and around 8% at the high court level.\n\nAlthough this is a small percentage, it represents a significant increase from a decade ago. However, women are under-represented in the higher judiciary, with only around 6% of judges in the Supreme Court of India being women.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso, read Judicial appointments in India.\n\nHigh Courts: 11.5% of judges in High Courts are female.\nOnly 17 of the 37 women who were recommended by the Supreme Court Collegium for appointment as high court judges have actually been given the job as of yet; the other names are still being processed by the national government.\nCollegium has thus far recommended 192 candidates for the high courts.\nA total of 37 of them, or 19%, were women.\nSubordinate Courts: About 30 percent are women judicial officers in subordinate courts.\nAdvocates: Of the 1.7 million advocates, only 15% are women.\nBar Council: Only 2% of the State Bar Council\u2019s elected officials are women. The Bar Council of India has no female members.\n\nThere are also initiatives and efforts being made in India to increase the representation of women in the judiciary. For example, the Indian government has set a goal of having at least 33% of all judicial positions filled by women.\n\nIn addition, the judiciary is also making efforts to address bias and discrimination against women in the legal profession and to create a more gender-sensitive environment in the courts.\n\nHowever, the progress is slow, and significant challenges still exist, such as a lack of women representation in recruitment, lack of opportunities for career development and advancement, and unconscious bias.\n\nAlso read: History of Indian Judiciary\n\nWhat is the significance of women\u2019s representation in the judiciary?\n\nHaving women represented in the judiciary is important for a number of reasons:\n\nFairness and equality: Representation of women in the judiciary helps to ensure that the perspectives and experiences of all members of society are taken into account when making decisions, which can lead to more fair and just outcomes.\nBreaking down stereotypes: Women\u2019s representation in the judiciary can serve as a powerful symbol of gender equality and can help to break down stereotypes and biases that may exist in the legal system.\nNeed for diversification: Diversification brings positive institutional changes, and the judiciary needs to be more diverse.\nRole models: Women judges can serve as role models for young women and girls, encouraging them to pursue careers in law and leadership.\nImproved decision-making: Research suggests that having more women in the judiciary leads to better decision-making and improved legal reasoning. Studies have found that more diverse groups tend to make more creative, innovative, and robust decisions.\nBalanced justice delivery system: The presence of women as judges and lawyers will substantially improve the justice delivery system.\nCultural perspective: Representation of women in the Judiciary brings in different life experiences and cultural practices which can be a key factor in understanding the nuances of the society and thus help in providing a more holistic approach towards decision making.\nLegitimacy: The judiciary will not be trusted if it is viewed as a bastion of elitism, exclusivity, and privilege. Therefore, the presence of women is essential for the legitimacy of the judiciary.\nBalanced and empathetic approach: Improving the representation of women in the judiciary could go a long way toward a more balanced and empathetic approach in cases related to sexual violence. The issue of gender sensitization has been raised many times, especially in cases where male judges failed to show empathy for female victims.\n\nOverall, having a more diverse judiciary that includes women can help to create a more fair, just, and equitable legal system for everyone.\n\nChallenges of women in the judiciary?\n\nThere are a number of challenges that women face in the judiciary, including:\n\nStereotypes & lack of infrastructure: The previous Chief Justice Ramana noted that barriers to entry and advancement for women in the legal profession include a lack of infrastructure, gender stereotypes, and social attitudes.\n\u201cClients\u2019 preferences for male attorneys, an unsettling atmosphere in courtrooms, a lack of infrastructure, crowded courtrooms, a lack of restrooms for women, etc. all discourage women from entering the profession.\nAccording to the study, there are only about 22% of the 6,000 trial courts without women\u2019s restrooms.\nGender bias: Women in the judiciary may face unconscious bias and discrimination from colleagues, clients, and other members of the legal community. This can make it harder for them to be taken seriously and can impede their advancement in their careers.\nWork-life balance: Women in the judiciary may face additional challenges in balancing their work and personal responsibilities, as the demands of the job can be intense and require long hours. This can make it harder for women to advance their careers and can contribute to burnout.\nMale-dominated appointment structure: Currently, there are many women candidates who are deserving of being appointed as judges, but the main issue is the Supreme Court\u2019s male-dominated collegium structure.\nHostile environment in the courtroom: It is very difficult for female litigators to advance professionally because of the hostile and sexist environment at the highest courts.\nDomestic duties: Despite being offered judgeships in the past, many women\u2019s rights advocates turned them down due to their domestic duties.\nLack of representation: Women are underrepresented in the judiciary, particularly at the higher levels. This can make it harder for women to find role models and mentors and can make it harder for them to be seen as qualified candidates for leadership positions.\nGlass ceiling: Women in the judiciary may hit a \u201cglass ceiling\u201d where they become stuck at a certain level in their careers, even if they are highly qualified, this is due to the lack of representation and bias.\nHarassment: Women in the judiciary also face a higher risk of harassment and assault, which can make the workplace an inhospitable environment.\n\nThese challenges can make it more difficult for women to succeed in the judiciary, but with more and more women entering the profession and advocating for change, the system is slowly but surely moving towards a more inclusive, equitable and fair environment.\n\nWhat are the Reasons for Low Women\u2019s Representatives?\n\nThere are several reasons why women are underrepresented in politics, including:\n\nPatriarchy in Society: The patriarchal nature of society is the main cause of the underrepresentation of women in the judiciary.\nCourtrooms frequently have hostile environments for women. Other traumatic experiences that are frequently related by many women lawyers include harassment, a lack of respect from the bar and the judiciary, and being told what to say and what not to say.\nOpaque Collegium System: Because entry-level positions in the lower judiciary are filled through entrance exams, more women tend to do so.\nThe collegium system used by the higher judiciary, however, has a history of being more opaque and therefore more likely to reveal bias.\nNo Women\u2019s Reservation: The High Courts and Supreme Court do not have reservation policies for women, which are common in lower levels of the judiciary in many states.\nAs a result of this reservation, states like Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, and Rajasthan now have 40\u201350% female judicial officers.\nFamily Responsibilities: The promotion of female judges from the lower courts to the higher courts is also influenced by factors related to age and family obligations.\nLack of role models and mentorship: Without female political leaders to look up to and learn from, it can be difficult for women to envision themselves in those roles.\nUnequal access to resources: Women tend to have less access to financial resources and networks that can be used to run for office.\nBias in the political process: Research has shown that women face bias in the political process, from the media to the voting booth, which can make it harder for them to win elections.\nNot Enough Women in Litigation: Given that judges in the high courts and Supreme Court are largely comprised of lawyers who were elevated from the bar to the bench, it is important to note that the number of women attorneys is still low, which limits the pool from which women judges can be chosen.\nJudicial Infrastructure: The lack of judicial infrastructure is another barrier that prevents women from entering the field of law.\nObstacles include small, crowded courtrooms, and a lack of restrooms, and childcare facilities.\nWay Forward\nA fixed percentage of women judges in the higher judiciary must be maintained and promoted in order for India\u2019s judicial system to evolve into one that is gender-neutral.\nBy raising awareness and emphasizing inclusivity, it is necessary to bring about institutional, social, and behavioral change among India\u2019s population.\nThe legal profession ought to be a symbol of gender equality because it is a gatekeeper of equality and a profession dedicated to upholding rights.\nA court may be more open to considering itself in a new light and more likely to undergo further modernization and reform if its long-standing demographics are altered.\nConclusion\n\nThere has been a steady improvement in the representation of women in the judiciary. But despite recent progress, bias against women in the legal system still exists.\n\nTo eliminate the bias and create a truly representative judiciary, institutional reforms, and social change are both required.\n\nAlso read: History of Indian Judiciary\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

What are Trade, Commerce, and Intercourse?\n\nThe word \u2018trade\u2019 means \u2018buying\u2019 or \u2018selling\u2019 of goods.\n\nThe term \u2018commerce \u2018includes all forms of transportation such as by land, air, or water. Commerce may be of two types, Intra- state trade which is confined within the territory of a State, and Inter State i.e. trade and commerce which overflows the boundary of one State and extends to two or more States.\n\nThe term \u2018intercourse\u2019 means the movement of goods from one place to another place.\n\nThus, the words \u2018trade, commerce, and intercourse; cover all kinds of activities which are likely to come under the nature of commerce.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Article 301?\nLimitations Imposed Upon the Freedom\nDifference Between Articles 19(1)(g) and 301\nWhy Freedom of Inter-State trade and Commerce is Important?\nConclusion\nWhat is Article 301?\n\nSubject to the provisions of this Part, trade, commerce, and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free.\n\nArticle 303(1) declares that neither the Parliament nor the State Legislature shall have the power to make any law giving, or authorizing the giving of, any preference to one State over another; or making or authorizing the making of, any discrimination between one State and another, in the field of trade, commerce or intercourse.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHence, if a State prohibits the sale of lottery tickets to others and promotes that of its own, it would be discriminatory and violative of Article 303.\n\nLimitations Imposed Upon the Freedom\n\nThe freedom of inter-state trade and commerce guaranteed by Article 301 is freedom from all restrictions, except those which are provided for in the other provisions (Articles 302 to 305) of Part XIII of the Constitution itself. Those limitations are:\n\nArticle 302: Non-discriminatory restrictions may be imposed by Parliament, in the public interest.\n\nUnder this power, Parliament enacted the Essential Commodities Act, of 1955, which empowers the government, \u2018in the interest of the general public\u2019, the Central Government can control the production, supply, and distribution of certain \u2018essential commodities\u2019, such as coal, cotton, iron and steel, petroleum.\n\nArticle 303(1): The article provides that parliament shall not have the power to make any law giving any preference to any one State over another by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in any one of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule.\n\nArticle 303(2): Parliament is even empowered to make discriminatory or preferential provisions for the purpose of dealing with a scarcity of goods arising in any part of India.\n\nArticle 304(a): Non-discriminatory taxes may be imposed by a State on goods imported from other States or Union Territories, similarly as on intra-State goods. This provision prohibits the imposition of discriminatory taxes by the state.\n\nArticle 304(b): Reasonable restrictions may be imposed by a State \u201cin the public interest\u201d. But, a bill for this purpose can be introduced in the legislature only with the prior sanction of the president. Further, the state legislature cannot give preference to one state over another or discriminate between the states.\n\nArticle 19(6)(4): The appropriate Legislature may make a law [under Article 19(6)(4)] for the carrying on by the State, or by a corporation owned or controlled by the State, of any trade, business, industry or service, whether to the exclusion, complete or partial, of citizens or otherwise.\n\nArticle 307: Parliament may by law appoint such authority as it considers appropriate for carrying out the purposes of articles 301, 302, 303, and 304, and confer on the authority so appointed such powers and such duties as it thinks necessary.\n\nAlso read: Sectors of the Economy: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary and Quinary\n\nDifference Between Articles 19(1)(g) and 301\n\nThe difference in the scope of the provisions of Articles 19(1)(g) and 301, guarantees the freedom of trade and commerce:\n\nArticle 19(1)(g) looks at freedom from the standpoint of the individual who seeks to carry on a trade or profession and guarantees such freedom throughout the territory of India subject to reasonable restrictions, as indicated in Article 19(5).\n\nArticle 301, on the other hand, looks at freedom from the standpoint of the movement or passage of commodities or the carrying on of commercial transactions between one place and another, irrespective of the individuals who may be engaged in such trade or commerce.\n\nHowever, if either of these freedoms is restricted, the offended party or even a State may challenge the legitimacy of the restriction, whether it was put in place by a law or an executive order.\n\nEven though Article 301 or 304 is not mentioned in Part III as a fundamental right, a violation of those articles would often constitute an infringement of a person\u2019s fundamental right protected by Article 19(1)(g), in which case the person can bring an application under Article 32.\n\nWhy Freedom of Inter-State trade and Commerce is Important?\n\nAny federal structure\u2019s main challenge is to reduce interstate barriers as much as possible so that individuals feel as though they are part of a single country and are free to live in any of the Units of the Union\u00a0on an individual basis.\n\nOne of the means to achieve this objective is to guarantee every citizen the freedom of movement and residence throughout the country. Our Constitution guarantees rights by Article 19(1)(d) and (e).\n\nNo less important is the freedom of movement or passage of commodities and commercial transactions between one part of the country and another. The progress of the country as a whole also necessitates the exchange of goods and services between different parts, without any barrier. This is particularly essential in a federal system.\n\nThe provisions of Articles 301-307 of our Constitution aim to protect this freedom. However, these laws go beyond just inter-State freedom and also cover intra-State freedom.\n\nIn other words, no restrictions can be placed on the movement of trade, commerce, and intercourse between any two points on Indian territory, regardless of whether a State border should be crossed or not.\n\nAlso read: Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the problems concerning inter-state trade and commerce are more economic in content than legal.\n\nThe Constitution aimed to promote free trade and commerce in India because it was fully understood that the country\u2019s economic integration and unity served as the primary stabilizing force for the advancement of its political and cultural unity and that it should operate as a single economic unit free from restrictions on internal trade.\n\nOne of India\u2019s fundamental goals is for its people to be united economically, and the constitution of India makes it a priority to guarantee the accomplishment of the goal.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

MPs, or members of parliament, are the terms used to describe Lok Sabha members.\n\nThese representatives are chosen from different states and union territories.

But it\u2019s crucial that his name is on the list of registered voters in his district.\n\nSeats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\n\nSome constituencies are set aside for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. These are referred to as Reserved Constituencies. Only candidates belonging to the SCs or STs, as the case may be, are eligible to run for office in each reserved constituency.\n\nTo elect one SC or ST candidate as their representative, each voter in each of these constituencies utilizes their right to vote. The reservation is provided for Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the Loksabha based on population ratios.\n\nSingle-member territorial constituencies\n\nThe whole nation divides into a number of territorial constituencies equal to the number of Lok Sabha members to be elected. One MP is chosen from each constituency.\n\nFirst Past The Post System\n\nThe people personally elect each and every Lok Sabha member. Any voter may cast a ballot to elect any candidate from his or her constituency of choice.\n\nThe candidate who receives the most votes out of all the candidates in a constituency is chosen to serve as the Lok Sabha representative for the people of that constituency.\n\nDuration of Lok Sabha\n\nThe Lok Sabha is not a continuing chamber.\n\nIts normal term is five years from the date of its first meeting after the general elections, after which it automatically dissolves.\n\nHowever, the President is authorized to dissolve the Lok Sabha at any time even before the completion of five years and this cannot be challenged in a court of law.\n\nFurther, the term of the Lok Sabha can be extended during a period of national emergency be a law of Parliament for one year at a time for any length of time.\n\nHowever, this extension cannot continue beyond a period of six months after the emergency has ceased to operate.\n\nThe Grounds for Disqualification for Lok Sabha Members\n\nAccording to Article 102 of the Constitution, a person is ineligible to be elected to, and to serve as, a member of either House of Parliament\n\nIf he holds any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State, other than an office declared by Parliament by law not to disqualify its holder;\nIf he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court;\nIf he is an undischarged insolvent;\nIf he is not a citizen of India, or has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign State, or is under any acknowledgement of allegiance to a foreign State;\nIf he is so disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament.\nThe Parliament has laid down the following additional disqualifications in the Representation of People Act (1951):\nHe must not have been found guilty of certain election offenses or corrupt practices in the elections.\nHe must not have been convicted for any offense resulting in imprisonment for two or more years. But, the detention of a person under a preventive detention law is not a disqualification.\nHe must not have failed to lodge an account of his election expenses within the time.\nHe must not have any interest in government contracts, works, or services.\nHe must not be a director or managing agent nor hold an office of profit in a corporation in which the government has at least a 25 percent share.\nHe must not have been dismissed from government service for corruption or disloyalty to the State.\nHe must not have been convicted for promoting enmity between different groups or for the offense of bribery.\nHe must not have been punished for preaching and practicing social crimes such as untouchability, dowry, and sati\n\nOn the question of whether a member is subject to any of the above disqualifications, the president\u2019s decision is final.\n\nHowever, he should obtain the opinion of the election commission and act accordingly.\n\nDisqualification on the Ground of Defection\n\nThe Constitution also lays down that a person shall be disqualified from being a member of Parliament if he is so disqualified on the ground of defection under the provisions of the Tenth Schedule. A member incurs disqualification under the defection law :\n\nIf he voluntarily gives up the membership of the political party on whose ticket he is elected to the House;\nIf he votes or abstains from voting in the House contrary to any direction given by his political party;\nIf any independently elected member joins any political party; and\nif any nominated member joins any political party after the expiry of six months.\n\nThe question of disqualification under the Tenth Schedule is decided by the\u00a0 Speaker in the case of Lok Sabha ( and not by the president of India ). In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that the decision of the Speaker in this regard is subject to judicial review.\n\nSpeaker of Lok Sabha\n\nThe Speaker serves as both the ceremonial and legal head of the Lok Sabha and serves as its chief spokesperson.\n\nThe Speaker was formerly known as the President when the institutions of the Speaker were established in India in 1921 in accordance with the terms of the Government of India Act of 1919 (Montague-Chelmsford Reforms).\n\nThe Speaker of the Central Legislative Assembly replaced the President of the Central Legislative Assembly under the 1935 Government of India Act. However, the 1935 Act\u2019s federal component was never enacted, therefore the old terminology persisted until 1947\n\nThe Speaker and Deputy Speaker are both elected under Article 93 of the Indian Constitution.\n\nThe honor of being the first Speaker belonged to G.V. Mavalankar.\n\nThe Speaker serves as the Lok Sabha\u2019s head, its representative, and the protector of the member\u2019s rights and privileges as well as those of the entire body and its committees.\n\nAs the main representative of the House, he or she has the final say on all matters pertaining to the Parliament.\n\nThe Constitution of India, the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the Lok Sabha, and parliamentary conventions are the three sources from which the Speaker of the Lok Sabha gets his or her authority and responsibility.\n\nDeputy Speaker\n\nAfter the speaker, the house elects the Deputy Speaker on a day set by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.\n\nThe Deputy Speaker has the same terms of office, reasons for removal, removal procedure, provisions for salary, and allowances as the Speaker.\n\nThrough a letter to the speaker, he or she resigns.\n\nWhen the Speaker is not present, the Deputy Speaker serves as the House\u2019s presiding officer and has all of the Speaker\u2019s authority. When the speaker is present, the deputy speaker takes the place of a regular house member.\nHe or she is directly accountable to the house rather than the speaker.\n\nHowever, he/she immediately becomes the head of the committee if he/she is a member of a parliamentary committee.\n\n\u00a0Pro Tem Speaker\n\nJust before the first meeting of the new Lok Sabha, the speaker of the previous one resigns.\n\nAs a result, the President names a member\u2014typically the senior member\u2014to serve as Pro Tem Speaker for the first session.\n\nThe President administers the Speaker Pro Tem oath.\n\nThe Speaker Pro Tem administers oaths to the members of the house and facilitates the election of a new Speaker.\n\nPanel of Chairpersons\n\nAccording to Lok Sabha rules, the Speaker appoints a panel of not more than 10 chairpersons from among the members.\n\nAny of them has the same authority as the Speaker when presiding over the House in the absence of the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker.\n\nHe or she serves in that capacity until a new panel of chairpersons is proposed.\n\nAny other person chosen by the House serves as Speaker when a chairperson from the panel is also absent.\n\nHowever, when the position of Speaker or Deputy Speaker is vacant, a member of the panel of chairpersons cannot preside over the House.\n\nPowers and Functions of the Lok Sabha\n\nThe following are the powers and functions of Lok Sabha.\n\nLegislative Powers\n\nOrdinary bills can only become law after being approved by both Houses of Parliament.\n\nAlthough ordinary bills can be introduced in either chamber of Parliament, about 90% of bills are introduced in the Lok Sabha.\n\nIf a law passed by the Lok Sabha is rejected by the Rajya Sabha and returned with or without changes, the Lok Sabha reconsiders the bill.\n\nA deadlock occurs if the Lok Sabha approves it again but the Rajya Sabha is still unwilling to approve it. If this deadlock is not resolved after six months, the President calls a joint sitting of the two Houses in accordance with Article 108\u2019s rules.\n\nExecutive Powers\n\nThe Council of Ministers is collectively responsible before the Lok Sabha in accordance with Article 75(3). The majority leader in the Lok Sabha becomes Prime Minister. The Lok Sabha is home to the majority of the ministries.\n\nAs long as the majority in the Lok Sabha has confidence in them, the ministers remain in their positions.\n\nIn accordance with the mechanism outlined in Rule 198 of the norms of procedure and conduct of business of the Lok Sabha, the Lok Sabha has the power to remove the ministry from office by voting a vote of no-confidence against it.\n\nAs a result, the Lok Sabha has the power to make or break the ministry. The Lok Sabha continues to have direct authority over the Council of Ministers.\n\nMinisters can be questioned by MPs about the administration\u2019s policies and activities. They are free to critique their actions. The Indian Constitution\u2019s Article 75 grants the right to ask inquiries.\n\nThey are capable of moving and adopting a variety of resolutions and motions (adjournment motion, call attention motion, censure motion, and no-confidence motion)\n\nFinancial Powers\n\nThe Lok Sabha has extensive budgetary authority. A money bill may only be introduced in the Lok Sabha in accordance with the guidelines provided by Article 109. The money bill then moves on to the Rajya Sabha after being approved by it.\n\nThe Lok Sabha Speaker decides if a certain law qualifies as a money bill or not in the event of a disagreement. His choice is final; it cannot be contested in a court, the Lok Sabha, or even the Rajya Sabha.\n\nAs a result, we can assert that the Lok Sabha has ultimate authority over the state\u2019s finances. No tax can be imposed, collected, altered, or eliminated without the consent of Loksabha.\n\nWithout the Lok Sabha\u2019s approval, the government cannot carry out its fiscal policy.\n\nJudicial Powers\n\nAdditionally, the Lok Sabha has some judicial duties. Either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha may initiate the impeachment procedures against the President referred to in Article 61. Only when an impeachment resolution is approved by both Houses with a 2/3 majority of their members can the President be removed from office.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha\u2019s allegations against India\u2019s vice president are also the subject of an investigation by the Lok Sabha.\n\nAccording to the provisions of Article 124 (4), the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha may vote together to remove any judge of the Supreme Court or of a State High Court.\n\nFor the removal of some high-ranking state officials, such as the Attorney General, the Chief Election Commissioner, and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, both Houses may pass a special address jointly and submit it to the President.\n\nAny member or citizen found guilty of violating the House\u2019s rules may also face punishment from the Lok Sabha.\n\nElectoral Powers\n\nA few electoral duties are also carried out by the Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha\u2019s elected members participate in the presidential election.\n\nIn accordance with Article 66 of the Indian Constitution, members of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha vote to choose the vice president of India.\n\nThe members of Loksabha also choose the Speaker and Deputy Speaker from among themselves.\n\nSome Other Lok Sabha Powers\n\nThe following duties are shared by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha:\n\nApproval of the President\u2019s ordinances [Article 123 (2)]\nA change in the state\u2019s borders.\u00a0 addition of new states, and renaming any state, Article (3)\nChanges the requirements for members of the State Legislatures and the Parliament as set forth in the RPA Act of 1951\nModifying the members of Parliament\u2019s pay and benefits.\nCreating a Joint Public Service Commission with at least two other states.\nPassing a resolution to dissolve or establish a state legislature\u2019s upper chamber (Article 169)\nApproval of an emergency declaration( Article 352 and Article 356)\nConclusion\n\nIn light of this, we can conclude that Lok Sabha plays a vital role in parliamentary proceedings. Despite the ups and downs of Indian politics, the Lok Sabha has remained a leader for political and social values and a melting pot of cultural diversity. Along with the Rajya Sabha, it serves as a flag bearer for the independent, socialist, secular, and democratic republic of India.\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi E S"

The challenges associated with legal education? Read further to know more.\n\nIn contemporary developing societies, which are vying to become social welfare states and are attempting to improve the socio-economic condition of the populace through peaceful means, the concepts of law, legal education, and development have come to be intertwined.\n\nThe same is valid in our nation. In a developing nation, it is essential for legal education to produce lawyers who have a social conscience.\n\nFor anyone involved in administration, trade, or industry, having a basic understanding of the law has become essential.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is legal education?\nAims\nWhat is the Quality of Legal education in India?\nObjectives of legal education\nImportance of legal education\nFactors that influence legal education in India\nLegal education institutions\nWhat are the Challenges?\nConclusion\nWhat is legal education?\n\nAccording to the Indian Law Commission, \u201cLegal education is a science that imparts to students knowledge of specific principles and legal provisions to enable them to enter the legal profession.\u201d Producing lawyers with a social conscience is the primary goal of legal education. But in the modern era, legal education ought to be seen as a tool for social design as well as a means of producing lawyers.\n\nThe legal profession is a noble calling, and its members enjoy a very high status, according to Justice Krishna Iyer. Every society is built on the rule of law, which also produces law-abiding citizens, lawyers, academics, and future judges. In India, legal education refers to the training that lawyers receive before they start practising.\n\nAccording to historical accounts, teachings about dharma and Nyaya were given to kings and princes during the ancient era. Then, during the Mughal period, the idea of legal representatives emerged. Due to the fact that many of our freedom fighters had legal backgrounds, legal education existed even before India gained its independence. However, it wasn\u2019t until after independence that it became significant.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSome traditional universities offer three-year law programmes, but these can only be continued after receiving a degree. Later, the establishment of the National Law University in Bangalore and the introduction of five-year law programmes increased the popularity of legal education in the twenty-first century.\n\nThere are currently 1200 law colleges in India, including public and private universities, and about 21 national law universities. This article discusses how the Indian Bar Council controls legal education in India.\n\nAims\n\nLegal education should not only produce lawyers but should be regarded as a legal instrument for social design. The main aims of legal education are as follows:\n\n\u00a0To train students for the legal profession;\n\u00a0To educate the students to solve the individual client\u2019s problems as well as to solve the society\u2019s problems in which he lives;\nTo provide a centre where scholars might contribute to the understanding of the law and participate in their growth and improvement;\nTo inculcate students with operative legal rules and to provide them adequate experience to apply these rules;\nTo point the right road for future development.\n\nThus, legal education should aim at furnishing skills and competence, for the creation and maintenance of a just society.\n\nWhat is the Quality of Legal education in India?\n\nThe quality of legal education in India varies greatly among institutions. Some law schools in India are considered to be of very high quality, offering excellent resources and well-trained faculty, while others may have fewer resources and less qualified faculty.\n\nThe University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Bar Council of India (BCI) are the two main regulatory bodies responsible for maintaining the quality of legal education in India. However, the quality of legal education in India has been a matter of concern for a long time, with issues such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of qualified faculty, and poor quality of teaching cited as major problems.\n\nThe UGC and the BCI have made efforts to improve the quality of legal education, such as setting standards for accreditation and curriculum and providing funding for legal education institutions. However, these efforts have not been able to address all the issues related to the quality of legal education in India.\n\nIn recent times, the legal education system has been facing challenges such as a lack of practical training and exposure, inadequate research, and a lack of focus on the needs of the legal profession.\n\nOverall, while there are some high-quality legal education institutions in India, the overall quality of legal education in India is considered to be inadequate by many experts and practitioners.\n\nObjectives of legal education\n\nThe objectives of legal education may be multi-fold in a developing democratic country like India. They are,\n\nTo develop research of value to education and society with the use of educational facilities.\nProvide students with a comprehensive understanding of the legal system: This includes teaching students about the sources of law, the structure of the legal system, and the processes of legal reasoning and decision-making.\nTo generate different kinds of skills and knowledge needed for tasks in society.\nDevelop students\u2019 legal research, writing, and advocacy skills: Legal education aims to teach students how to research and analyze legal issues, how to communicate effectively in legal contexts, and how to present legal arguments in writing and in court.\nEncourage critical thinking and ethical behaviour: Legal education aims to teach students how to think critically about legal issues, how to consider the implications of different legal decisions, and how to conduct themselves ethically as lawyers.\nPrepare students for the legal profession: Legal education aims to prepare students for the legal profession by providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary to practice law and pass the bar exam.\nTo broaden opportunity and mobility in society\u2013 notably among groups who may have been deprived.\nFoster civic responsibility and public service: Legal education can also aim to foster civic responsibility and public service by encouraging students to use their legal knowledge and skills for the benefit of their communities.\nProvide a global perspective: Legal education can aim to provide a global perspective on the law by exposing students to different legal systems and cultures, and by encouraging them to think about the role of law in an increasingly interconnected world.\nPromote innovation and research: Legal education can aim to promote innovation and research by encouraging students to think about new ways of approaching legal issues, and by fostering an environment of scholarly inquiry.\nTo develop perceptions and to understand the problems of one\u2019s society and to influence values and attitudes.\nEncourage diversity and inclusion: Legal education can aim to encourage diversity and inclusion by providing opportunities for students from different backgrounds to study and learn together, and by promoting an understanding of the perspectives and experiences of different groups.\nImportance of legal education\n\nThe concept of legal education is broad. It encompasses the profession that is exercised in a court of law, as well as administration in various fields where the law is essential. It promotes equality before the law.\n\nProviding the foundation for the legal profession: Legal education provides the foundation for the legal profession by teaching the knowledge, skills, and values necessary for the practice of law.\nEnsuring access to justice: Legal education is essential for ensuring access to justice, as it trains the individuals who will provide legal services and represent clients in court.\nPromoting the rule of law: Legal education plays a crucial role in promoting the rule of law, by educating individuals about the legal system and their rights and responsibilities as citizens.\nFacilitating economic and social development: Legal education is important for facilitating economic and social development, as it enables individuals to understand and navigate the legal system and to participate in creating laws and policies.\nEncouraging critical thinking: Legal education encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for analyzing complex legal issues and making informed decisions.\nProviding a vehicle for social change: Legal education can be a vehicle for social change, by training individuals to advocate for marginalized groups and to work towards a more just society.\nEncouraging professionalism and ethical behaviour: Legal education promotes professionalism and ethical behaviour among lawyers, which is important for maintaining the integrity of the legal profession and ensuring that justice is served.\nFostering global understanding: Legal education can foster global understanding by exposing students to different legal systems and cultures, and by encouraging them to think about the role of law in an increasingly interconnected world.\n\nThe calibre and standard of the legal education received at law school are reflected in the bar and bench. If one is aware of state affairs, one is better equipped to understand the law. In a democratic society, the value of legal education cannot be overstated.\n\nEveryone has a responsibility to be aware of the law. Law-related ignorance is not an excuse. As a result, legal education not only creates influential lawyers but also law-abiding citizens with respect for human rights.\n\nFactors that influence legal education in India\n\nLegal education is influenced by a multitude of factors. They are as follows-\n\nGovernmental policy: Government policies and regulations play a significant role in shaping the legal education system in India, including funding, accreditation, and curriculum development.\nBar council of India: The Bar Council of India (BCI) is the regulatory body for legal education in India, and its policies and decisions can have a significant impact on the legal education system.\nUniversity grants commission: The UGC is responsible for funding and regulating legal education in India. It sets standards for accreditation and curriculum and provides funding for legal education institutions.\nAffiliating universities: Universities play a major role in shaping legal education in India through their affiliating role with law colleges. They have the power to approve the curriculum, faculty, and infrastructure of the law colleges.\nThe private governing body of law colleges: Many law colleges in India are run by private governing bodies, which have a significant influence on the direction and focus of legal education in these institutions. These bodies set the admission criteria, and fees, and have a major role in the decision-making of the institutions.\nNational litigation policy: The government\u2019s national litigation policy can also influence legal education in India by shaping the demand for legal professionals with specific skills and expertise.\nDevelopments in the legal profession: Legal education in India is also influenced by international developments and trends in legal education. This includes the adoption of international best practices, exchange programs, and collaborations with foreign universities.\nDevelopments in the legal system: The legal system is constantly evolving, and legal education must keep pace with these changes in order to ensure that graduates are equipped with the knowledge and skills they need to practice law effectively.\nThe kind of students who enrol: The student body can also play a role in shaping legal education, as the needs and interests of students can influence the curriculum and resources available.\nThe calibre and commitment of the faculty: The calibre and commitment of the faculty can have a significant impact on the quality of legal education.\nThe infrastructure available: Legal education institutions require a range of resources, such as libraries, computer labs, and moot courts, to provide a comprehensive education for their students.\nTechnological advancements: Technology is constantly changing and this has an impact on the legal education system. For example, the use of online resources and virtual classrooms.\nThe developments in other fields of education: Legal education is also influenced by developments in other fields of education, such as the use of problem-based learning and interdisciplinary approaches.\nThe changes in society: Legal education is also influenced by the changes in society. For example, the increasing awareness of human rights and environmental issues may lead to the inclusion of such subjects in the curriculum.\nLegal education institutions\n\nOver the past ten years, private universities have taken a significant part in studying how legal education has changed. They work in the area of legal education and make an effort to raise the standard of legal instruction in India. National Law Schools, on the other hand, placed a strong emphasis on specialised education.\n\nMany institutions have decided to completely abandon the lecture method of instruction in favour of more engaging and creative learning techniques. Moot courts are a common practice in Indian law schools, which has made legal education more practical and behavioural than merely learning the letter of the law.\n\nThe importance of extracurricular activities like seminars, workshops, and other events has now been integrated into the curriculum. The requirement for internships during the study period has been changed to mandatory. On-campus hiring has become a standard practice at the majority of law schools.\n\nWhat are the Challenges?\n\nThere are several challenges associated with legal education in India, including:\n\nQuality of teaching: Many law schools in India have been criticized for having poor quality of teaching, with inadequate resources and infrastructure, and a lack of well-trained and motivated faculty.\nCurriculum: The legal curriculum in India has been criticized for being outdated and not reflective of the changing legal and social landscape.\nAccess to legal education: Legal education in India is expensive and out of reach for many people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, which can limit diversity in the legal profession.\nEmployment opportunities: Despite a large number of law graduates, there are limited employment opportunities in the legal sector, which can lead to a surplus of unemployed or underemployed graduates.\nProfessionalism: There have been concerns about the lack of professionalism and ethics among some lawyers in India, which can negatively impact the legal profession and the administration of justice.\nLegal aid and access to justice: India\u2019s legal aid system is underfunded and overburdened, which can make it difficult for people from marginalized communities to access justice.\nResearch and innovation: There is a lack of focus on research and innovation in legal education in India, which can limit the development of new ideas and approaches to legal issues.\nConclusion\n\nLegal education in India is going through a very exciting phase. Though India has the largest population of lawyers in the world, there is a need for eminent lawyers.\n\nThe opportunities for bright law graduates are massive and the new generation of law schools has a major role to improve the standards of legal education in India.\n\nHence, the scenario of legal education is becoming more and more specialized as was envisioned by the well-wishers of the legal profession.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

He had the power to establish laws and regulations for repealing, amending, or changing any laws or regulations that applied to everyone, regardless of country.\nIn 1935, the Government of India Act, 1935, which included a significant delegation plan, was passed. The report from the Committee of Ministers\u2019 Powers was presented and approved, which put an end to India\u2019s need for force assignment and appointment of enactment.\n\nIt is hardly unexpected that the framers of the over 400-article Indian Constitution included a solution. However, why were these clauses added to the constitution? This is a result of the politicians\u2019 propensity to use numerous legislative formulations in the Constituent Assembly. These issues were relatively minor in comparison to other significant constitutional issues that the Assembly chose to ignore and leave to the future agreement or judicial interpretation.\n\nAlso, read the article: Modern Indian History: From about the middle of the eighteenth century until the present \u2013 significant events, personalities, and issues \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nNeed for Delegated Legislation\n\nThe legislature has a set amount of time in which to pass laws on all issues. It doesn\u2019t have enough time to carefully enact the laws.\n\nLack of specialisation: When it comes to technical intricacies, the legislature has little expertise. After constructing a structure, the task is assigned to the government agency with the necessary knowledge.\nCrisis Situations: The legislature lacks the expertise to offer a quick fix in the event of an internal or foreign emergency.\nConditions that are complex: Because modern administration is complex, it is necessary to give laws more attention to holistic issues like employment, health, education, regulating trade, etc.\nDisadvantages of Excessive Delegation Powers\nThe ability of the legislature to control legislation will be diminished by excessive delegation. As a result, the legislature becomes less significant.\nIt is against the spirit of democracy for unelected members of the administration to make laws.\nDelegated legislation is not the subject of extensive discussion. This will end the examination that the legislature provides when passing laws normally.\n\u00a0According to the doctrine of separation of powers, the legislature is responsible for making laws. Excessive delegation runs counter to this idea.\nDemonetization and the Problem of Delegation Power\nThe Union government has the authority to issue a notification that a specific currency denomination is no longer considered legal tender in accordance with Section 26(2) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.\nAny series of bank notes of any denomination will cease to be legal tender with effect from a specific date, the centre, upon the proposal of the Central Board of RBI, declares by publication in the Gazette of India.\nThe RBI Act was passed by the Parliament to give the central government authority to change the characteristics of legal money.\nThe demonetization exercise\u2019s legal foundation was largely established via a gazette notification that the centre made using its authority.\nConclusion\n\nLaws passed via a parliamentary act are referred to as delegated or subordinate legislation. Even though the lawmaking body has the power to create laws, it has the option to grant that power by a resolution to other organisations or people. The resolution that authorised this delegation is known as the Enabling Act. Through the Enabling Act, the council adopts general regulations, and the delegated power establishes specific principles.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

The Central Government may order the establishment of a Tribunal to consider whether a person falls under this description or not.\n\nConstitution of Tribunals\n\nThe Tribunal shall consist of a such number of persons having judicial experience as the Central Government may think fit to appoint.\n\nWhere the Tribunal consists of two or more members, one of them shall be appointed as the Chairman thereof.\n\nPower of Tribunals\n\nThe Tribunal shall have the powers of a civil court while trying a suit under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in respect of the following matters, namely: \u2013\n\nSummoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him.\nRequiring the discovery and production of any document.\nIssuing commissions for the examination of any witness.\nAmendment to Foreigners (Tribunals) Order\n\nThe May 2019 amendment only lays down the modalities for the Tribunals to decide on appeals made by persons not satisfied with the outcome of claims and objections filed against the NRC.\n\nThe aforementioned Order, issued on May 30, 2019, is currently only applicable to Assam for all practical purposes because NRC work is only being performed in Assam.\n\nThis Amendment Order also allows the District Magistrate to approach the Tribunal for an opinion on whether or not the Appellant classifies as a \u201cforeigner\u201d under the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946.\n\nThe amended Foreigners (Tribunal) Order, 2019 also empowers individuals to approach the Tribunals. Earlier only the State administration could move the Tribunal against a suspect.\n\nAlso read: Fundamental Rights Available Only to Citizens of India\n\nWhy Do We Need the Foreigners Tribunal?\n\nThe need for Foreigners Tribunals arises for the following reasons:\n\nThe power to recognize potential foreigners was granted to district commissioners and superintendents of police (SPs). Their references for these \u201csuspected persons\u201d were required to be made before an authority which came into existence through the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964\nThe Election Commission of India (ECI) can also refer cases of D or Doubtful voters to the local SP, who then refers them to a tribunal to verify their citizenship\nIndividuals who were left off of the National Register of Citizens (NRC final draft), which was published in August 2019, may file an appeal with the Foreigners Tribunal to prove their citizenship.\nAre Foreigners Tribunal meant Only For Assam?\n\nThe Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964 is applicable to the whole of India, but as of right now, only Assam has a Foreigners Tribunal. In other states, if an illegal immigrant is found, he is brought before a local court and dealt with in accordance with the Foreigners Act, of 1946. The power to establish FTs in states was previously solely available to the Center; however, after the 2019 amendment to the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, states now have the same authority.\n\nWho Can Setup These Tribunals?\n\nThe Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964 has been amended by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), giving district magistrates in all States and Union Territories the authority to establish tribunals (quasi-judicial bodies) to determine whether a person residing in India illegally is a foreigner or not.\n\nConcerns Related to Foreigners\u2019 Tribunals\n\nThere are certain concerns related to Foreigners\u2019 Tribunals.\n\nFailure of Issuing Authorities to Appear\n\nTo understand how citizenship issues were adjudicated, the authors examined 787 orders and judgments from the Gauhati High Court. Due to issuing authorities\u2019 failure to appear before the FTs to testify that the documents produced are authentic and genuine to their knowledge, one in two people is labeled as foreigners.\n\nJudicial Delay\n\nFurthermore, the issue of judicial delay affects cases that involve foreigners. For Example: In Anowara\u2019s case, before the Foreigners Tribunal deemed Anowara a foreigner, her case was filed in 2007 and was pending for 11 years. The analysis of the Gauhati high court cases showed that, on average, it took 2,466 days (6.7 years) for the high court to reach a decision after the case was filed with the FTs.\n\nImplications of the NRC\n\nWith\u00a0over 19 lakh people excluded from the National Register of Citizens\u00a0(NRC) in Assam. The work of the FTs and the Gauhati high court increased exponentially. Between 1985 to October 2019, there were 4,68,905 cases referred to Foreigners Tribunals.\n\nBurden of Proof\n\nunder the\u00a0Foreigners\u2019 Act, the\u00a0burden of proof is reversed\u00a0and placed on the individual to prove that she is not a \u2018foreigner\u2019. Due to this reversed burden of proof, an individual is expected to discharge a higher standard of proof by supporting her citizenship claim with a wide variety of documentary evidence.\n\nRead:\u00a0Tribunals in India\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

These laws may be used to prevent individuals from leaving a particular religion or to prevent religious groups from proselytizing or recruiting members from other religious groups.\n\nThe specific provisions of anti-conversion laws vary from place to place and may be enforced through criminal or civil penalties. In some cases, anticonversion laws are used to protect the dominant religion in a particular society or to suppress minority religions.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSome people believe that anti-conversion laws violate the right to freedom of religion, which is protected by international human rights laws.\n\nWhat is the need for anti-conversion law?\n\nThere are a variety of reasons why some people or organizations may advocate for anti-conversion laws. Some people believe that these laws are necessary to protect the cultural and social cohesion of a particular community or society.\n\nThey may argue that conversion from one religion to another can create conflicts and divisions within a community and that anticonversion laws are needed to prevent such conflicts. Others may view anti-conversion laws as a way to protect the traditions and beliefs of a particular religion and to prevent the erosion of its influence or power.\n\nSome argue that anti-conversion laws are necessary to protect individuals from being coerced or deceived into converting to a different religion. They may claim that some religious groups use manipulative or unethical tactics to recruit members and that anticonversion laws are needed to prevent such abuse.\n\nNo Right to Evangelize: According to the Constitution, every person has the fundamental right to profess, practise, and spread their religion. A collective right to proselytise cannot be derived from an individual\u2019s freedom of conscience and religion. Because both the person seeking to be converted and the person who is converting have a right to religious freedom.\n\nFraudulent Marriages: In the recent past, there have been several instances where people have forced someone to convert to their religion after they have been married to someone of a different religion by either lying about or hiding their religion.\n\nSC Observations: Recently, the Supreme Court also gave these occurrences judicial notice. According to the court, such incidents not only violate the converted individuals\u2019 right to freedom of religion but also work to undermine the secular foundation of our society.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that many people disagree with the need for anticonversion laws, and believe that the right to freedom of religion should be protected at all times. They argue that individuals should be free to choose their religion without interference or coercion and that anticonversion laws can be used to suppress minority religions and undermine the right to freedom of religion.\n\nWhat is the status of the anti-conversion law in India?\n\nSeveral anti-conversion laws in India regulate the conversion of one religion to another. These laws vary from state to state, and the specific provisions of the laws can differ significantly.\n\nConstitutional Provision: Article 25 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the freedom to practise, profess, and propagate any religion. It also grants all religious groups the right to control their religious affairs, subject to public morality, health, and order.\n\nExisting Laws: Religious conversions have not been subject to any national restrictions or regulations. Private Member Bills to control religious conversions, however, have repeatedly been introduced in the Parliament since 1954 (but never passed by it).\n\nAdditionally, the Union Law Ministry stated in 2015 that Parliament lacks the legislative authority to enact legislation prohibiting conversion. Several states have passed \u201cFreedom of Religion\u201d laws over the years to prohibit forced, fraudulent, or coerced conversions to another religion.\n\nIn general, however, anti-conversion laws in India require that individuals seeking to convert to another religion must obtain permission from the government before doing so. Some states have more stringent anticonversion laws than others, and some states have provisions that specifically target certain religious groups or activities.\n\nIn recent years, there has been significant controversy and debate over the use of anti-conversion laws in India. Some people argue that these laws are necessary to protect the cultural and social cohesion of the country, while others believe that they are used to suppress minority religions and violate the right to freedom of religion.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has ruled that anti-conversion laws are constitutional as long as they are not used to interfere with an individual\u2019s right to freedom of religion. However, there have been cases in which these laws have been used to target and persecute minority religious groups.\n\nWhat are the issues associated with anti-conversion laws?\n\nThere are several issues associated with anticonversion laws that have been the subject of debate and controversy. Some of the main issues include:\n\nFreedom of religion: Anticonversion laws can be seen as a violation of the right to freedom of religion, which is protected by international human rights laws. These laws can restrict an individual\u2019s ability to choose their own religion and can be used to suppress minority religions.\nDiscrimination: Anticonversion laws can be used to discriminate against certain religious groups, particularly minority religions. In some cases, these laws have been used to target and persecute minority religious groups.\nCoercion and manipulation: Some people argue that anticonversion laws are necessary to prevent coercion and manipulation in religious conversion. However, others believe that these laws are often used as a pretext to suppress minority religions and restrict the right to freedom of religion.\nSocial and cultural divisions: Anti-conversion laws can contribute to social and cultural divisions within a community or society, particularly if they are used to protect the dominant religion.\nConflict with other laws: Anti-conversion laws can sometimes conflict with other laws, such as laws that protect freedom of expression or the right to freedom of association.\nEffectiveness: There is debate over the effectiveness of anti-conversion laws in achieving their intended goals. Some people argue that these laws are not effective in preventing religious conversion, while others believe that they are necessary to protect the cultural and social cohesion of a community or society.\nWhat are Supreme Court Judgements on Marriage and Conversion?\n\nThere have been several judgments by the Supreme Court of India on marriage and conversion. Here are a few examples:\n\nIn the case of Hadiya vs. Ashokan K.M., the Supreme Court ruled that an adult has the right to marry and convert to another religion of their choice. The court also stated that the state does not have the right to interfere with an individual\u2019s freedom to marry and convert.\nIn the case of Lata Singh vs. the State of Uttar Pradesh, the Supreme Court held that an individual has the right to marry someone of their choice, regardless of their religion, caste, or social status. The court also stated that any interference with this right by the state or any other party is a violation of the right to freedom of choice.\nIn the case of Sarla Mudgal vs. Union of India, the Supreme Court ruled that a person can convert to another religion for marriage, but that such a conversion should not be used as a pretext for avoiding legal obligations or responsibilities. The court also stated that any conversion solely for marriage is void and cannot be used as a defence in any legal proceedings.\nIn the case of S. Pushpabai vs. C.T. Selvaraj, the Supreme Court ruled that an individual has the right to convert to another religion, but that such a conversion should be genuine and voluntary. The court also stated that any coercion or misrepresentation in connection with a religious conversion is a violation of the right to freedom of religion.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these are just a few examples of Supreme Court judgments on marriage and conversion. There have been many other cases that have dealt with these issues, and the specific provisions of these judgments may vary.\n\nWay Forward\n\nIt is a complex issue with multiple perspectives on the matter, however here are a few ways in which the current situation with the anticonversion laws in India could be addressed moving forward:\n\nReviewing the existing laws: The current anti-conversion laws in India should be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with international human rights standards and the Indian Constitution. This review should be carried out by experts in the field of human rights and religious freedom and should take into account the views and concerns of all relevant stakeholders.\nLimiting the scope of the laws: The scope of anti-conversion laws should be limited to prohibit only forced or fraudulent conversions while allowing genuine and voluntary conversions. This would help to ensure that the laws are not used to violate the right to freedom of religion or to discriminate against certain religious groups.\nIncrease the transparency and accountability in implementation: There should be more transparency and accountability in the implementation of anticonversion laws, with clear guidelines and procedures in place for granting and denying permission for conversions, and for investigating and prosecuting alleged violations of the law. This would help to prevent arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement of the laws.\nPrioritize dialogue and education: There should be more efforts made to promote dialogue and understanding between different religious groups, with a focus on education and awareness-raising about different religions. This could help to reduce tensions and conflicts between religious groups and promote greater respect for diversity and freedom of religion.\nMonitoring and Reporting: To ensure that the laws are not being misused, there should be an independent body that will monitor the law\u2019s implementation and take complaints, to ensure that they are being implemented fairly and with transparency and also to report any abuses to the authorities.\n\nUltimately, the way forward for anti-conversion laws in India would require a comprehensive approach that balances the right to freedom of religion and the protection of the cultural and social cohesion of the country.\n\nArticle written by: Remya"

The 12 members nominated by the President must be chosen from the persons having \u2018Special Knowledge or practical experience in Literature, Science, Art, and Social Service\u2019.\n\nRepresentation of States\n\nThe representative of each state in the Rajya Sabha are elected by the elected members of the legislative assembly of the States.

Under this power, Parliament has prescribed that the representative of each Union Territory in the Rajya Sabha is indirectly elected by the members of the electoral college specially constituted for this purpose.\n\nThis election is also held in accordance with the system of Proportional Representation by means of a Single Transferable Vote.\n\nOut of 8 Union Territories, only Delhi, Puducherry, and Jammu & Kashmir have representation in Rajya Sabha.\n\nSystem of Proportional Representation\n\nWhile the system of Separate Electorates was abandoned by the constitution, the system of proportional representation was partially adopted for the second chamber in the Union and State Legislatures.\n\nUnder the system of Proportional Representation, all sections of people get representation in proportion to their number.

In other words, a resolution for the removal of the vice president can be introduced only in the Rajya Sabha and not in the Lok Sabha.\n\nArticles 352, 356, and 360: If a proclamation is issued by the President for a national emergency or president\u2019s rule or financial emergency at a time when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place within the period allowed for its approval, then the proclamation can remain effective even if it is approved by the Rajya Sabha alone.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Hindi name of Rajya Sabha was adopted by the Council of States in 1954. The status of the Rajya Sabha in our constitutional system is neither as weak as the House of Lords in the British constitutional system nor as strong as the Senate in the American constitutional system.

For example, a death sentence may be commuted to rigorous imprisonment, which in turn may be commuted to simple imprisonment.\n\nRemission: It reduces the period of the sentence without changing its character e.g. a sentence of imprisonment for 1 year may be remitted to 6 months.\n\nRespite: It means awarding a lesser sentence instead of one originally awarded due to some special fact, e.g. the physical disability of a convict or the pregnancy of a woman offender.\n\nReprieve: It implies a stay of the execution of a sentence (especially that of death) for a temporary period. Its purpose is to enable the convict to have time to seek pardon or commutation from the President.\n\nDifference Between Pardoning Power of President and Governor\n\nThe Constitution, under Article 161 provided that the governor of a state also possesses the pardoning power.\n\nHence, the governor of a state can also grant pardons, reprieves, respites and remissions of punishment or suspend, remit and commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence against state law.\n\nThe pardoning power of the governor differs from that of the President in the following two respects:\n\nThe President can pardon sentences of court-martial (military courts) while the governor has no such power related to sentences of court-martial.\nThe President can pardon the death sentence while the governor cannot do the same. Even if a state law prescribes a death sentence, the power to grant a pardon lies with the President and not with the governor. However, the governor has the power to suspend, remit or commute a death sentence. In other words, both the governor and the President have concurrent power in respect of suspension, remission and commutation of a death sentence.\nPrinciples Laid Down by Supreme Court Related to Pardoning Powers\n\nThe Supreme Court examined the pardoning power of the President under different cases like Kehar Singh\u2019s Case and Maru Ram\u2019s Case, and laid down the following principles:\n\nThe convict seeking relief has no right to insist on an oral hearing.\nNo guidelines need to be laid down by the Supreme Court for the exercise of the power.\nThe power is to be exercised by the President on the advice of the Central Government.\nThe President can go into the merits of the case and take a different view.\nExercise of the power by the President is not open to judicial review, except to the limited extent as indicated in Maru Ram\u2019s case,\nPresident is not bound to give reasons for his order.\nThe President can afford relief not only from a sentence that he regards as unduly harsh but also from an evident mistake.\nWhere the earlier petition for mercy has been rejected by the President, a stay cannot be obtained by filing another petition.\n\nThe Court can interfere only where the Presidential decision is wholly irrelevant to the object of Article 72 or is irrational, arbitrary, discriminatory or mala fide. The power exercised under Article 72/161 of the Constitution can be subjected to limited judicial review. This power of clemency is to be exercised cautiously and in appropriate cases, which in effect, mitigate the sentence of punishment awarded and which do not, in any way wipe out the conviction.\n\nHowever, the delay in deciding the mercy petitions under Articles 72 and 161 has come under heavy criticism by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, while taking note of the contemporary jurisprudential development with regard to delay in the execution of the death sentence, commuted the death sentence into life imprisonment.\n\nThe fact that no time limit is prescribed to the President/Governor for disposal of the mercy petition. The government is required to work in a more systematised manner to repose the confidence of the people in the institution of democracy and as such the Supreme Court suggested the government to render its advice to the President within a reasonable time so that the President is in a position to arrive at a decision at the earliest.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

web-services integration is being extended to payment systems of Railways, Defence, major PSUs, and State Governments.\nSeamless processes and online time-bound payment, which is also mandated by the Department of Expenditure, have given confidence to the vendors and reduced their \u2018administrative\u2019 costs involved in pursuing officers for timely payment.\n\nEfficiency\n\nDirect purchase on GeM can be done in a matter of minutes and the entire process is online, end-to-end integrated and with online tools for assessing price reasonability.\nFor procurements of higher value, the bidding/Reverse Auction (RA) facility on GeM is among the most transparent and efficient, in comparison to e-procurement systems in vogue within the Government sector.\nGeM bidding/RA ensures competition, fair play, speed & efficiency and leads to proper price discovery.\nThe reasonableness of the rates can also be confirmed through online comparison with market prices on leading e-Commerce portals.\n\nSecure and safe\n\nGeM is a completely secure platform and all the documents on GeM are e-Signed at various stages by the buyers and sellers.\nThe antecedents of the suppliers are verified online and automatically through MCA21, Aadhar, and PAN databases.\nIn addition, SEBI-empaneled credit rating agencies are also being used for conducting third-party assessments of suppliers.\nThis would further strengthen due diligence about the veracity of suppliers wanting to do business on GeM.\nFor high-value bids/RA on GeM, an e-Bank Guarantee is also being introduced.\n\nPotential to support Make in India\n\nOn GeM, the filters for selecting goods that are Preferential Market Access (PMA) compliant and those manufactured by Small Scale Industries (SSI), enable the Government buyers to procure Make in India and SSI goods very easily.\nAfter the launch of GeM, it has been noticed that several leading computer manufacturers have placed PMA-compliant products on GeM\n\nSavings to the government\n\nThe transparency, efficiency, and ease of use of the GeM portal have resulted in a substantial reduction in prices on GeM, in comparison to the tender, Rate Contract, and direct purchase rates.\nThe average prices on GeM are lower by at least 15-20%, and in some cases even up to 56%.\nGeM is also doing Demand Aggregation for items that are to be procured by various Central/State Government Departments.\nDemand Aggregation is expected to further drive the prices south, by way of standardization of specifications and economy of scale.\n\nIf pursued to its logical conclusion, Government e-Marketplace (GeM) would eventually emerge as the National Public Procurement Portal (NPPP), keeping in tune with the Global best practices; most of the OECD countries, like the USA, South Korea, the UK, Singapore, etc, have a single NPPP and as a result annual savings of billions of dollars are made in public procurement, besides giving a fillip to the domestic industry.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

However, simply knowing what entitlements are and who is responsible for fulfilling them is insufficient to ensure that public services are delivered in a passable and effective manner to the \u2018intended\u2019 recipients.\nCitizens in a good civil society are most concerned that their government is fair and just. To be effective, a government\u2019s governance systems and subsystems must be efficient, economic, ethical, and equitable.\nFurthermore, the governing process must be just, reasonable, fair, and user-friendly. In addition to promoting transparency and people\u2019s participation, the administrative system must be accountable and responsive in order to achieve these and other qualities and good governance.\nTransparency ensures that people understand what is going on and the reasoning behind the decisions made by the government or its functionaries at various levels. Accountability ensures that a civil servant is responsible and accountable to the government, society, and the people for every action and inaction in government and its consequences.\n\nAlso read: Tax Transparency\n\nAccountability of Public Servants\nCivil servants are held accountable in all democratic countries to both the political executive and the citizens for ensuring responsive, transparent, and honest policy implementation and service delivery. However, ensuring accountability for performance is a difficult task in government; there are numerous complexities involved in holding public officials accountable for outputs and outcomes.\nSetting and measuring performance targets is easier for service delivery agencies, especially when the service provided is tangible and thus an easily measured unit, but for many public organizations where the output is policy-related and thus not very concrete, performance assessment becomes much more complicated.\nThe spread of responsibility and authority across different levels of government, as well as the lack of a link between authority and accountability, contribute to a system in which plausible alibis for non-performance abound, particularly for activities that cross-departmental dividing lines or different functional divisions within departments.\nAccountability mechanisms in any country are broadly classified as those located within the state and those located outside the state.\nAccountability of the executive branch of government to Parliament and citizens is, of course, a fundamental feature of a democracy.\nMajor Differences Between Transparency And Accountability\n\u00a0 Criteria\n\t\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Transparency\n\t\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Accountability\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Definition\n\t\nConducting activities or performing actions openly and clearly.\n\t\nBeing responsible for one\u2019s actions and having the ability to provide sound reasoning for actions.\n\n\n\u00a0 Focus\n\t\nOpenness and clarity\n\t\nAcknowledgement and being responsible for one\u2019s actions.\nInitiatives To Enhance Transparency In India\n\nCitizens Charters, the Right to Information Act, e-procurement,\u00a0 e-Governance, and Right to Public Service Legislation, are some of India\u2019s major initiatives to improve transparency.\n\nCitizen\u2019s Charter\nA Citizens\u2019 Charter represents the Organization\u2019s commitment to service delivery standards, quality, and timeliness, a grievance redress mechanism, transparency, and accountability.\nThe Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances coordinates efforts to formulate and operationalize Citizens\u2019 Charters in its efforts to create a more responsive and citizen-friendly administration.\nRight to Information (RTI) Act\nIt is a parliamentary act in India that establishes laws and procedures for citizens\u2019 access to information. It superseded the previous Freedom of Information Act of 2002.\nAny Indian citizen may seek information from a \u201cpublic authority\u201d (a government entity or \u201cstate instrumentality\u201d) under the RTI Act, which is required to respond promptly or within thirty days.\nIf the petitioner\u2019s life or liberty is at stake, the information must be delivered within 48 hours. The RTI Bill was passed by the Indian Parliament on June 15, 2005, and went into effect on October 12, 2005.\nE-Procurement\n\nThe Central Public Procurement Portal is a strong and secure platform that provides complete transparency in public procurement for the Government of India, most states, and local governments across the country.\n\nE-Governance\nIt is defined as the use of information and communication technology (ICT) at all levels of government to provide services to citizens, interact with businesses, and communicate and exchange information between government departments in a timely, efficient, and transparent manner.\nRight to Public Services legislation\nIt is made up of statutory laws that ensure the timely delivery of a wide range of government services to citizens, as well as a system for disciplining errant public servants who fail to provide the service required by the statute.\nInitiatives To Enhance Accountability In India\nPublic Accounts Committee, CAG, Lokpal, CVC, Lokayukta, CPGRAMS and Public Interest Litigation are some of India\u2019s major initiatives to improve Accountability.\nPublic Accounts Committee\nThe Public Accounts Body is a committee of elected members of the Indian Parliament tasked with auditing the government\u2019s revenue and expenditure. They ensure that parliament has control over the executive, on the premise that parliament represents the will of the people.\nSocial Audit in Local Governments:\u00a0 In the context of government schemes, a social audit is an accountability mechanism that measures, assesses, and identifies gaps in service delivery while also promising to close those gaps with the direct participation of intended beneficiaries.\nIn essence, social auditing is a monitoring tool that allows citizens to not only keep track of funds spent, but also to evaluate the effectiveness of a scheme by examining its impact, determining whether the scheme has benefited its target audience, and allowing an organization to evaluate the scheme\u2019s long-term sustainability.\n\nAlso read: Goods and Services Tax (GST): Everything You Need to Know Including Issues Unresolved\n\nComptroller and Auditor General (CAG)\nThe CAG is a constitutionally mandated individual tasked with overseeing the government\u2019s finances and operations.\nHe or she is critical in making the government more transparent and accountable to the legislature as well as civil society. The Constitution seeks to ensure that he has significant autonomy from other branches of government.\nThe CAG audits the federal and state government\u2019s finances, as well as entities owned or funded by the government.\nIts role, like that of the auditor of a private company, is to ensure that proper accounting standards are used to account for financial transactions. It also ensures that financial transactions adhere to applicable standards.\nThe CAG also assesses the performance of various government agencies, businesses, laws, and even welfare programmes such as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.\nLokpal\nA Lokpal is an anti-corruption authority or ombudsman agency in the Republic of India that represents the public interest.\nIt has jurisdiction over the central government in order to investigate corruption charges against its public officials and other corruption-related matters.\nFollowing Anna Hazare\u2019s Jan Lokpal agitation in 2011, the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act was passed in parliament with revisions in 2013. The current Lokpal Chairperson is Pinaki Chandra Ghose.\nCentral Vigilance Commission (CVC)\nThe Central Vigilance Commission is the apex vigilance institution, independent of any executive authority, and is tasked with overseeing all vigilance activity under the Central Government as well as advising various authorities in Central Government organizations on vigilance planning, execution, review, and reform.\nVigilance entails taking clean and timely administrative action to improve staff efficiency and effectiveness, as well as the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the organization because a lack of Vigilance leads to waste, losses, and economic deterioration.\nThe CVC was established by the government in 1964 in response to the recommendations of the Committee on Prevention of Corruption, which was led by Shri K. Santhanam. The CVC Act, passed by Parliament in 2003, gave the CVC statutory status.\nThe CVC is independent of any Ministry or Department and is only accountable to Parliament.\nLokayukta\nThe Lokayukta, or Indian Parliamentary Ombudsman, is appointed by and for each of India\u2019s state governments.\nIt takes effect in a state after the state legislature passes the Lokayukta Act and a person of good standing is appointed to the position.\nThe position was created to handle complaints about the government\u2019s or its administration\u2019s working integrity and efficiency as quickly as possible.\nThe Maharashtra Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayuktas Act of 1971 was the first state to establish Lokayukta.\nCentralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS)\nAddressing the general public\u2019s grievances is one of the hallmark efforts for governance reform launched by the Indian central government.\nIn June 2007, the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances established CPGRAMS.\nAny Indian citizen can use the public grievance process to bring their problems, grievances, or requests to the attention of Ministries and Departments at the national and state levels of government.\nPublic Interest Litigation\nPIL was introduced by Justice P. N. Bhagwati as a means of securing public interest and demonstrating the availability of justice to socially disadvantaged parties.\nConclusion\n\nThe national public information infrastructure must be strengthened and expanded through the construction of information networks, allowing for greater access to digital information and the use of information technology. It is critical to change the way government employees think.\n\nThis will be used to organize programs for orientation, training, and capacity-building. States may be urged to create an impartial public grievance redress authority to handle allegations of delays, harassment, and corruption.\n\nFurthermore, if the governance structure is sufficiently open, accountability will be promoted. Transparency and accountability should be linked to an organization\u2019s mission, which prioritizes achieving public welfare.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0Information sharing and Transparency in Government\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

They, therefore, included provisions for occasionally incorporating modifications. These changes are called constitutional amendments.\n\nHowever, the procedure of amendment laid in the Indian constitution is neither as easy as in Britain nor as difficult as in the USA.\n\nAlso read: Multi-state Cooperative Societies Amendment Bill 2022\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWho has the Power to Amend the Constitution?\nTypes of Amendment\nProcedure for Amendment as per Article 368\nWhat is Simple Majority?\nWhat is Special Majority?\nSpecial Majority as Per Article 249\nSpecial Majority as Per Article\u00a0368\nSpecial Majority as Per Article 368 Plus State Ratification\nSpecial Majority as Per Article\u00a061\nAmendability of Fundamental Rights and Evolution of Basic Structure\nImportant Amendments of the Indian Constitution\nWho has the Power to Amend the Constitution?\n\nArticle 368 in Part XX of the Indian Constitution deals with the power of the Parliament to amend the constitution and its procedure if requires.\n\nSo, the Parliament is empowered to amend or repeal any provision of the constitution in accordance with the procedure laid down for this purpose.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHowever, it was ruled by the Supreme Court in Kesavananda Bharati Case 1973 that the parliament cannot amend those provisions which form the \u201cbasic structure\u201d of the Constitution.\n\nTypes of Amendment\n\nArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution has provided for two types of amendments, that is by a special majority of Parliament and the special majority of parliament along with the ratification of half of the state\u2019s legislatures by a simple majority.\n\nCertain provisions of the Constitution require amendment by a simple majority of each house, that is, a majority of members of each house present and voting (similar to ordinary legislation). These amendments are not considered to be amendments under Article 368.\n\nIt clearly means that the amendment of Indian Constitution is possible in three ways:\n\nAmendment by a simple majority of the Parliament,\nAmendment by a special majority of the Parliament, and\nAmendment by a special majority of the Parliament, and the ratification of half of the state legislatures.\nProcedure for Amendment as per Article 368\n\nThe procedure for amendment of the Indian Constitution as per Article 368 is as follows:\n\nAn amendment of this Constitution may be initiated only by the introduction of a Bill for the purpose in either House of Parliament and not in the state legislature.\nThe bill does not require the prior permission of the President for introduction in the Parliament.\nThe bill shall be presented by a minister or a private member.\nThe bill must be passed in each house by a special majority i.e., the majority of the total membership of the house and the majority of two third of members of the house present and voting.\nEach house must have to pass the bill separately and there is no provision for joint sitting if any case of disagreement arises between the two houses.\nIf the bill seeks to amend the federal feature of the constitution, it must also be ratified by half of the state legislature with a simple majority.\nAfter duly passed by both houses and ratified by the states (if requires), the bill is presented to the president for his assent.\nThe President can neither withhold nor return the bill for the reconsideration purpose of the parliament. Hence, President must have to give his assent to the bill.\nAfter the assent of the President, the bill will become an Act.\nWhat is Simple Majority?\n\nThis refers to the majority of more than 50% of the members\u00a0present and voting and it is outside the ambit of Article 368. This is also known as the functional majority or working majority. The simple majority is the most frequently used form of majority in Parliamentary business. When the constitution or the laws do not specify the type of majority needed, the simple majority is considered for voting.\n\nTo understand the simple majority, let us consider a situation in Lok Sabha. On a particular day, out of the total strength of 545, 45 were absent and 100 abstained from voting on an issue. So only 400 members were present and voting. Then the simple majority is 50% of 400 plus 1, ie. 201.\n\nCases where the simple\u00a0majority is\u00a0used:\n\nTo pass Ordinary/Money/Financial bills.\nTo pass Non-Confidence Motion/Adjournment Motion/Censure Motion/Confidence Motion.\nFor the removal of the Vice President majority required in Lok Sabha is the simple majority \u2013 A67(b).\nTo declare a financial emergency.\nTo declare a state emergency (President\u2019s rule).\nFormation of new states\u00a0and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing states,\nAbolition or creation of legislative councils in states,\nUse of\u00a0official language,\nCitizenship\u00a0\u2013 acquisition, and termination,\nElection of Speaker/Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha and\u00a0State legislatures.\nFifth Schedule\u00a0\u2013 administration of scheduled areas and scheduled tribes,\nSixth Schedule\u00a0\u2013 administration of tribal areas.\nWhat is Special Majority?\n\nAll types of majorities other than the absolute, effective or simple majority are known as the special majority. A special majority are of 4 types, with different clauses.\n\nThe two most significant provisions that can be changed by a special majority are the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), however, any changes must stay within the constraints of the Basic Structure of the Constitution.\n\nType 1 \u2013 Special Majority as Per Article 249.\nType 2 \u2013 Special Majority as per Article 368.\nType 3 \u2013 Special Majority as per Article 368 + 50 per cent state ratification by a simple majority.\nType 4 \u2013 Special Majority as per Article 61.\nSpecial Majority as Per Article 249\n\nSpecial majority as per article 249 requires a majority of 2/3rd members present and voting. For example, if out of the 245 members in Rajya Sabha, only 150 are present and voting, then the special majority required as per article 249 would be 101.\n\nCases where special\u00a0majority as per article 249 is\u00a0used:\u00a0\n\nTo pass the Rajya Sabha resolution to empower the parliament to make laws in the state list. (valid up to 1 year, but can be extended any number of times).\n\nSpecial Majority as Per Article\u00a0368\n\nSpecial majority as per article 368\u00a0requires a majority of\u00a02/3rd members present and voting supported by more than 50% of the total strength of the house. This type of majority is used for most of the Constitutional amendment bills. To pass a constitution amendment bill in Rajya Sabha, in addition to getting the support of 123 members, the bill should be favoured by more than 2/3rd of the members present and voting.\n\nCases where special\u00a0majority as per article 368\u00a0is\u00a0used:\n\nTo pass a constitutional amendment bill which does not affect federalism.\nRemoval of judges of SC/HC.\nRemoval of CEC/CAG.\nApproval of a national emergency requires a special majority as per Article 368 in both houses.\nResolution by the state legislature for the creation/abolition of the Legislative Council (Article 169).\nSpecial Majority as Per Article 368 Plus State Ratification\n\nThis type of special majority is required when a constitutional amendment bill tries to change the federal structure. Special majority as per article 368 plus state ratification requires a majority of 2/3rd members present and voting supported by more than 50% of the state legislatures by a simple majority.\n\nCases where special\u00a0majority as per article 368 plus state ratification is\u00a0used:\u00a0\n\nTo pass a constitutional amendment bill which affects federalism like the position of High Court Judges.\n\nSpecial Majority as Per Article\u00a061\n\nSpecial majority as per article 61\u00a0requires a majority of\u00a02/3rd members of the total strength of the house. In Lok Sabha, the special majority as per article 61 is\u00a0364 while in Rajya Sabha, the special majority as per article 61 is 164.\n\nCases where special\u00a0majority as per article 61 is used:\u00a0\n\nFor the\u00a0impeachment of the Indian President.\n\nAmendability of Fundamental Rights and Evolution of Basic Structure\n\nThe question of whether Fundamental Rights can be amended by the Parliament under 368 or not was the reason for the evolution of the basic structure. Important incidents related to this are:\n\nShankari Prashad Case, 1951\n\nSupreme Court ruled that the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution under Article 368 also includes the power to amend the Fundamental Rights.\n\nGolakhnath Case, 1967\n\nSupreme Court reversed its earlier judgement. Here, the Supreme Court ruled that Fundamental Rights are given a \u201ctranscendental and immutable\u201d position. So, the Parliament cannot abridge or take away any of the Fundamental Rights.\n\n24th Amendment Act, 1971\n\nThe Parliament reacted to the Court\u2019s judgement in the Golakhnath Case 1967. The act amended Articles 13 and 368 and declared that Parliament has the power to abridge or take away any of the Fundamental Rights under Article 368 and such an act will not be a law under the meaning of Article 13.\n\nKesavananda Bharati Case, 1973\n\nSupreme Court overruled its judgement made in Golakhnath Case and stated that the Parliament is empowered to take away any of the Fundamental Rights but at the same time it introduced a new doctrine of the \u201cBasic Structure\u201d. It ruled that the Power of Parliament under Article 368 does not enable it to alter the \u201cBasic Structure/Feature\u201d of the Constitution and declared Fundamental Rights, a basic structure of the Constitution.\n\n42nd Amendment Act, 1976\n\nThe act amended article 368 and declared that there is no limitation on the constituent power of Parliament and no amendment can be questioned in any court.\n\nMinerva Mills Case, 1980\n\nIn this case, Supreme Court invalidated the provision as it excludes judicial review which is a \u201cbasic feature\u201d of the constitution.\n\nWaman Rao Case, 1981\n\nSupreme Court further clarified that the doctrine of Basic Structure would apply to the constitutional amendment enacted after 24 April 1973 (i.e., after the date of the judgement of the Keshwanand Bharti case).\n\nImportant Amendments of the Indian Constitution\n\nHere is a list of some major amendments to the Indian Constitution:\n\nFirst Amendment (1951): This amendment protected the rights of property owners and made it more difficult for the government to enact land reform measures. It also added the Ninth Schedule, which protected certain laws from being challenged in the courts.\n\nFourth Amendment (1955): This amendment authorized the government to take over the management of \u201cabsentee landlord\u201d estates, which were estates owned by landlords who did not live on or manage the land.\n\nSeventh Amendment (1956): This amendment extended the powers of the government to acquire property for public purposes and to provide compensation to the owners.\n\nEleventh Amendment (1961): This amendment authorized the government to take over the management of \u201cinam\u201d lands, which were lands granted to individuals or institutions by the government.\n\nSixteenth Amendment (1966): This amendment authorized the government to levy taxes on agricultural income.\n\nEighteenth Amendment (1971): This amendment made significant changes to the Indian Constitution, including the creation of a new state (Meghalaya), the inclusion of a new language (Santali) in the Eighth Schedule, and the abolition of the privy purses of the former rulers of the princely states.\n\nTwenty-fifth Amendment (1971): This amendment recognized the right to property as a legal right rather than a fundamental right.\n\nThirty-ninth Amendment (1975): This amendment protected the constitutional position of the state of Sikkim after it was merged with India.\n\nForty-second Amendment (1976): This amendment made a number of changes to the Indian Constitution, including the addition of the words \u201csecular\u201d and \u201csocialist\u201d to the Preamble and the insertion of the Fundamental Duties of citizens.\n\nForty-fourth Amendment (1978): This amendment reversed many of the changes made by the Forty-second Amendment and restored the rights and freedoms of citizens.\n\nFifty-second Amendment (1985): This amendment recognized the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act as a fundamental right.\n\nSixty-first Amendment (1989): This amendment lowered the voting age from 21 to 18.\n\nSixty-ninth Amendment (1991): This amendment recognized the capital city of Delhi as a Union Territory with a legislature.\n\nSeventy-third Amendment (1992): This amendment recognized the right to panchayats (local self-governments) as a fundamental right and provided for the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in panchayats.\n\nSeventy-fourth Amendment (1992): This amendment recognized the right to municipalities (local self-governments) as a fundamental right and provided for the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in municipalities.\n\nSeventy-seventh Amendment (1995): This amendment provided for the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in posts in cooperative societies.\n\nNinety-third Amendment (2006): This amendment provided for the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in higher education institutions.\n\nNinety-fifth Amendment (2009): This amendment provided for the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the promotion to government jobs.\n\nOne hundred and third Amendment (2019): This amendment provided for the reservation of seats for economically weaker sections of society in higher education institutions.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Under the rules formulated by him, the single largest opposition party must have a strength of at least 10% of the total strength of the House in order to designate its leader as the Leader of the opposition.\n\nIt is a statutory position that is defined in the 1977 Salaries and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act.\n\nLeader Of Opposition-Current Discussions:\n\nCongress is currently the second largest party and got 44 seats in the 16th Lok Sabha and 52 in the 17th Lok Sabha.

The Supreme Court rejected the appeal stating though non-statutory, but Speaker\u2019s statement or procedure that evolved to run the House was outside the purview of judicial review.\n\nLeader Of Opposition- Significance:\n\nThe \u201cshadow prime minister\u201d or the \u201calternative prime minister\u201d are terms used to describe him. If the current administration is toppled or is unable to get a majority in the house of parliament, he also offers a backup administration.\n\nThe absence of such a Leader of the Opposition will weaken the democratic spirit since the opposition will be unable to present a united front in opposition to the ruling party.\n\nBy offering the administration constructive critique, he also contributes significantly to the government\u2019s functioning in terms of policy and legislative actions.\n\nHe also offers a different perspective and aids in the representation of one that differs from the government\u2019s.\n\nThe opposition leader, among other things, also keeps an eye out for violations of minorities\u2019 rights and calls for debates when the government tries to evade parliamentary scrutiny.\n\nHe is essential in ensuring impartiality and bipartisanship in the nominations made to institutions that promote accountability and openness.\n\nComparison with other Countries\nBritain: Officially, the opposition is known as Her Majesty\u2019s Loyal Opposition. To counterbalance the ruling cabinet and position its members for future ministerial positions, they also establish the Shadow Cabinet.\nUnited States: Minority parties in Congress are accountable to the President. A healthy democracy must allow for the fundamental right to disagree. The inclusion of LoP lends objectivity and a contrarian viewpoint to the government\u2019s selections and conclusions.\n\nAlso read: Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel \u2013 Biography, Facts, Life, and Contributions to Modern India\n\nNeed For the Leader of Opposition:\n\nThe leader of the opposition acts as a measure of check and balance in appointing chiefs of bodies like CVC, CBI, etc.\n\nFor instance: In 2011, Smt. Sushma Swaraj drew attention to inconsistencies in Mr. P J Thomas\u2019 selection as CVC. The SC upheld her claim and later overturned Thomas\u2019 appointment.\n\nParliamentary democracy will be weakened by the lack of an opposition leader since the opposition won\u2019t be able to present a united front against the ruling party.\n\nThe opposition\u2019s major responsibility is to challenge the current administration and make those in power answerable to the people. In defending the nation\u2019s citizens\u2019 best interests, the opposition leader bears equal responsibility.\n\nWay Forward:\n\nThe role of the leader of the opposition is essential to the proper operation of the opposition in Parliament, regardless of who wins the majority. Now that the Leader of the opposition is recognized by law, it cannot be disregarded or weakened, regardless of how flexible or ambiguous the legal system may be.\n\nWhen no opposition party wins 55 or more seats, a crisis arises. In these circumstances, the leader of the numerically largest opposition party may be considered to be appointed as the opposition leader by the speaker.\n\nArticle written by Rahul Ravi"

Roy, an Indian communist pioneer.\n\n1935: With its proposal for the formation of a Constituent Assembly to draft the Indian Constitution, the Indian National Congress then took center stage.\n\n1940: The British Government ultimately agreed to this uncompromising demand of the Indians in 1940 after receiving a draught plan from Sir Stafford Cripps.\n\nStephen Cripps recognized that an Indian constitution ought to be developed by the Cripps Proposal, but the Indians rejected it. The British idea was referred to by Gandhiji as a \u201cbankrupt bank check.\u201d\n\nThe Constituent Assembly was first recommended by the Cabinet Mission, making a lasting historical impression as it signaled the start of the process of drafting the Indian Constitution.\n\n\u00a01946:\u00a0An \u201cObjective Resolution\u201d was presented by\u00a0Jawaharlal Nehru, laying down the underlying principles of the constitution.

Gandhiji advocated the third level of government\u00a0that can understand the problems of the people of the village at the grassroots level.\n\nIf we would see our dream of Panchayat Raj, i.e., true democracy realized, we would regard the humblest and lowest Indian as being equally the ruler of India with the tallest in the land.\u2014 Mahatma Gandhi\n\nArticle written by: Aseem Muhammed"

            "[CONTENT]": "National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) established in 1993 is a constitutional body under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. NCBC is an important topic for the IAS Exam and is included under the GS-II. Read here to know more about the commission.\n\nThe NCBC was formed as an initiative for investigating the conditions and difficulties of the socially and educationally backward classes and to make appropriate recommendations concerning them.\n\nTwo Backward Class Commissions were established under the leadership of Kaka Kalekar and B.P. Mandal in the 1950s and the 1970s, respectively.\n\nThe Indra Sawhney case (Mandal Commission) of 1992 led to the establishment of the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC).\n\nThe Supreme Court of India examined the creation of NCBC as a statutory body in the Mandal Commission\u2019s final decision.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNational Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC)\nConstitutional provisions of the National Commission for Backward Classes\nPowers and functions of NCBC\nSignificance\nConcerns\nWay forward\nNational Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC)\n\nNational Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) was initially constituted by the Central Govt by the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, of 1993 and so far, the Commission had been reconstituted 7 times up to 2016.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAccording to NCBC recommendations, OBC can be divided into three categories: extremely backward, very backward, and backward. In the central list of OBCs, there were 5013 more backward castes in 2016.\n\nThe 123rd Constitution Amendment bill of 2017 was introduced in Parliament with the aim of more effectively defending the rights of underprivileged sections. Simply put, it reinforced the NCBC to better defend the interests of the lower classes.\n\nIn August 2018, the 123rd Amendment Act of 2017 received presidential approval, giving NCBC constitutional standing.\n\nThe present Commission (8th) has been accorded Constitutional Status and constituted through the \u201cConstitution (One Hundred and Second Amendment) Act, 2018\u201d Act.\n\nArticle 338B has been inserted, forming a Commission for the socially and educationally backward classes to be known as National Commission for Backward Classes.\n\nComposition:\n\nThe Commission consists of:\n\nChairperson\nVice-Chairperson\nThree other Members in the rank and pay of Secretary to the Govt of India.\n\nTheir condition of service and tenure of office has been notified by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.\n\nNCBC is headquartered in Delhi.\n\nConstitutional provisions of the National Commission for Backward Classes\nAccording to Article 340, it is important to recognize those \u201csocially and educationally backward classes,\u201d comprehend the causes of their backwardness, and offer solutions to ease their problems.\nNew Articles 338B and 342A were inserted by the 102nd Constitution Amendment Act.\nAdditionally, the revision modifies Article 366.\nThe NCBC is empowered by Article 338B to investigate complaints and welfare programs involving socially and educationally disadvantaged populations.\nThe President is given the authority to name socially and educationally backward classes in various states and union territories under Article 342A.\nIn conjunction with the governor of the relevant State, he may take this action. However, if the list of disadvantaged classes is to be changed, a bill passed by Parliament will be necessary.\nPowers and functions of NCBC\nTo look into and keep an eye on all issues involving the socially and educationally disadvantaged classes that are connected to the appropriate operation of the safeguards offered and are covered by the Constitution or any other applicable law.\nTo actively participate in and provide advice about the socioeconomic development of the socially disadvantaged classes, as well as to assess the level of that growth.\nIt provides the President with reports on the operation of the safeguards on an annual basis.\nA copy of each report is sent to the State Government if it deals with any issues that the State Government is interested in.\nThe protection, welfare, development, and advancement of the socially and educationally underprivileged sections fall under the purview of NCBC.\nWhile hearing a case, it possesses all the civil court\u2019s authority.\nSignificance\nEnsuring justice for the disadvantaged social and educational groups in society.\nThe commission addresses the issues that the lower classes are worried about and promotes social equality.\nIt can assist the oppressed classes in battling atrocities committed against them and ensuring swift justice.\nIt wouldn\u2019t also infringe on state governments\u2019 powers because they would establish their commissions for the underprivileged classes.\nThe National Commission for Scheduled Castes and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes are now on the same footing with the NCBC.\nBetter transparency is discussed in Article 342 (A), which also makes it essential to obtain the parliament\u2019s approval before removing or including any community from the list of the underprivileged.\nA significant step toward making NCBC more effective and democratic in furthering the interests of socially and educationally backward classes is the addition of one woman and at least two individuals with an understanding of the backward class.\nConcerns\nThe possibility that the new NCBC won\u2019t offer a strong and reliable social justice architecture is one of the key worries.\nThe government is not required by law to follow the National Commission for Backward Classes\u2019 recommendations.\nSeveral states have failed to put the 27% reservation for OBCs into effect.\nIt has no authority to add or delete classes from the list of groups considered to be backward or to define backwardness.\nIn many boards, commissions, government committees, and other fora, OBCs are underrepresented.\nThere is not much of an OBC presence on the high courts or supreme court.\nPeriodic revision of the backward class list in cooperation with the backward class commission is not mentioned in the Act.\nThe makeup of the new NCBC does not include features of the expert body.\nWay forward\n\nThe caste census results must be made public, and the reservation system must be put into place by them. The National Commission for Backward Classes\u2019 membership must consider gender sensitivity and stakeholder representation.\n\nBy subdividing OBCs, less dominating OBCs will have better access to perks like reservations in government positions and educational institutions. To advance social justice, political parties must switch from vote-bank politics to values-based politics.\n\nRelated article: National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST)\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

This has sparked a nationwide debate.\n\nThe petitioner contends that the First Amendment damages the basic structure doctrine of the Constitution of India, impacting the freedom of speech and freedom to trade.\n\nThe petitioner has also claimed that the amendment also neglects national security by dropping the expression \u2018tends to overthrow the State\u2019, which raises grave concern in the context of the dangers posed to the concept of the secular democratic republic by radicalism, terrorism, and religious fundamentalism.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFirst Amendment Act 1951\nMajor modifications\nWhat led to the amendment?\n1st Constitutional Amendment Act in the news\nWay forward\nFirst Amendment Act 1951\n\nThe Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951 is the official name of the amendment.

Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nThe primary objective of the First Amendment Act was to address certain legal and constitutional challenges that arose in the early years of the Republic of India. It aimed to modify specific provisions of the Constitution to overcome legal hurdles and better align with the evolving needs of the nation.\n\nLand Reform and Right to Property:\nOne of the significant changes introduced by the First Amendment Act was related to the right to property. Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31 of the Constitution, which dealt with the right to acquire, hold, and dispose of property, were amended. The amendment aimed at providing the government with the authority to impose reasonable restrictions on the right to property for land reform and the acquisition of property for public welfare.\nFreedom of Speech and Expression:\nThe First Amendment Act also made changes to Article 19(2), which deals with reasonable restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression. The amendment aimed at clarifying and broadening the scope of permissible restrictions on free speech to include matters related to public order, security of the state, and relations with foreign countries.\nSpecial Provisions for Advancement of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes:\nThe amendment inserted Article 15(4) and Article 16(4) to provide for special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes, including Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. These provisions allowed the government to make reservations in educational institutions and public employment to promote the interests of these communities.\nValidation of Certain Acts and Regulations:\nThe First Amendment Act included a provision (Article 31A) to validate certain laws related to land reform and the abolition of zamindari systems, even if they infringed upon property rights. This was done to shield such laws from legal challenges.\nPower of the State to Make Special Provisions:\nThe amendment also added Article 46, which directs the state to promote with special care the educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other weaker sections of the society.\nWhat led to the amendment?\n\nWhen the government faced harsh press criticism in 1950 for its response to the refugee inflow in West Bengal and the extrajudicial killings of communist dissidents in Madras, the necessity to limit freedom of speech emerged.\n\nThe government suppressed the press, but the courts ruled that this was unconstitutional, compelling the government to find alternative solutions.\n\nAccording to Article 31\u2019s provisions, laws listed in the Ninth Schedule cannot be contested in court because they infringe upon citizens\u2019 basic rights.\n\nThe State now has extensive authority to purchase estates or take over the operation of any corporation or property in the public interest under Article 31(A). It attempted to keep such purchases out of the purview of judicial review under Articles 14 and 19.\n\nMisuse of the Ninth Schedule was widespread. More than 250 laws are listed in the ninth schedule, which shields them from judicial review.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court ruled in the Kesavananda Bharati case of 1973 that judicial review cannot be abolished as a fundamental structure, Articles 31(A), 31(B), and 31(C) preserved land reform laws and prioritized the application of the Directive Principles over individual liberty.\n\n1st Constitutional Amendment Act in the news\n\nThe Supreme Court has agreed to examine a PIL challenging changes made to the right to freedom of speech and expression by the First Amendment to the Constitution in 1951, with the petitioner contending that the amendment damages the basic structure doctrine.\n\nIn his plea, the petitioner said:\n\nSection 3(1) of the 1951 Amending Act substituted original Clause (2) of Article 19 dealing with reasonable restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) with a new Clause (2), which contained \u201ctwo objectionable insertions\u201d allowing restrictions also \u201cin the interest of public order\u201d and \u201cabout incitement to an offence\u201d.\nThe new Clause (2) also omitted the expression \u201ctends to overthrow the State\u201d as appeared in the original Clause (2).\n\nThe plea urged the court to declare Section 3 (1)(a) and 3 (2) of the First Amendment \u201cbeyond the amending power of Parliament\u201d and void since the \u201csame damage the basic or essential features of the Constitution and destroy its basic structure\u201d.\n\nRead:\u00a0The Changing Constitution Since Independence-The Hindu\n\nWay forward\n\nThe implications of the First Amendment Act 1951 have been a reason for numerous political debates on the relevancy and sanctity of democracy.\n\nThe ninth schedule has become controversial due to its absolute exemption from judicial scrutiny. This has led to the misuse of the laws several times.\n\nHence, it is a positive approach to revisit the amendment to rectify the shortcomings.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

To answer these questions, read further.\n\nThe process of handling complaints from consumers and citizens, as well as the decisions made in response to any issues they present, is known as grievance redressal.\n\nEvery human relationship is built on the concept of \u2018trust\u2019. Grievances arise as a result of failure to fulfill commitments, which fosters distrust among the public and hurts the relationship between the public and the government. Hence, redressal of the grievances becomes imperative. The timely resolution of grievances strengthens democracy by providing stability to the government and increasing public trust in the government.\n\nAn effective Grievance Redressal Mechanism is an important factor in the Government of India\u2019s call for \u201cmaximum governance and minimum government\u201d. The vision of New India by 2022 is dependent on responsive and effective government, and it is a critical requirement.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nExisting Grievance Redressal Mechanism\nImportance of grievance redressal\n2nd ARC Recommendations\nChallenges to grievance redressal\nWay Forward\nExisting Grievance Redressal Mechanism\nUnder the cabinet secretary of the government of India, the directorate of public grievances helps in solving unresolved grievances.\nThere is a Central Vigilance Commission to solve any type of public grievance regarding the conduct and functioning of the public servant.\nThere is a Lokpal Act to inquire into the cases related to the complaints of ministers, public servants, and even the former prime minister.\nThe National and State Human Rights Commission, the\u00a0 National and State Women\u2019s Commission, and the National Commission for SC and ST take the grievances and seek resolution of complaints in their prescribed fields and also seek their amicable redressal.\nThe 73rd Amendment Act\u00a0mandates the Gram Sabha to perform grievance redressal services to the members of the Sabha and the concerned areas under them.\nThere is a Consumer Protection Council at the union and state levels to assert grievances regarding the quality, effectiveness, and utility of the article.\nThe banking ombudsman scheme under the Banking Regulation Act and RTI Act empowers citizens to seek grievances from the government of India.\nThe government of India has also come up with certain initiatives regarding the redressal of the citizens via ICT like Twitter Seva, E Dakhil, UMANG app, INGRAM portal, CPGRAMS, PRAGATI, etc.\nImportance of grievance redressal\n\nThe timely and effective capture of public grievances and providing them redressal regarding the same help in generating better policy outcomes.

It was proposed by the 2nd Administrative Reforms Commission.\n\n2nd ARC Recommendations\nThere is a need for a strong and effective internal grievance redressal mechanism in each organization,\nthe government should analyze the concerned areas wherein the interventions would be required,\nmake proper use of Lok Adalat and\nthere needs to be proper state-society cooperation,\nparticipation of women and physically challenged in the grievance redressal mechanism.\nChallenges to grievance redressal\n\nAmong the majority of citizens, there is a lack of awareness and knowledge about the channels and the platforms through which the complaints have to be made to the concerned authorities. Consumers are also sometimes afraid to report malpractices to the concerned authorities.\n\nConsumers don\u2019t want to reveal their identities and want to report anonymously, especially those against the authorities, and the unavailability of such options makes it difficult for them to complain resulting in hesitation.\n\nThere is also a gender divide evident here, as women may not have the requisite resources and opportunities to voice their grievances.\n\nIndia has a culture of adjustments and we don\u2019t like to complain that results in adjusting rather than raising their voices against the concerns and the authorities.\n\nThe majority of grievance portals are online and also not available in all languages which makes it difficult for many people to register complaints because of this digital illiteracy, and the digital divide leads to differentiated access to opportunities to express their grievances.\n\nThere is no adequate digital infrastructure available and it also lacks digital skill training which is a prerequisite for the implementation and disposal of complaints regarding grievance redressal.\n\nThere is evidence of corruption and malpractices at all levels of the authorities and various redressal channels are subject to high pendency rates and slow processes because of bureaucratic red tape.\n\nThere is a high level of pendency, delays, lack of information dissemination from the authorities, and inaccuracies present, which makes it difficult to resolve the grievances. Many times the high disposal rates also don\u2019t mean high resolution of issues.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThe grievance redressal mechanism should not be looked upon as a challenge but rather a priority for better policy outcomes and good governance. The channels must be open and viable, as the complaints come through informal channels.\n\nThere should also be an awareness generation campaign for which the government can make use of Gram Sabha where people would be made aware of the channels through which complaints can be registered and we should try to make use of technology for better results in a time-bound approach.\n\nAs a cornerstone of \u2018Minimum Governance,\u2019 the resolution of public grievances is a critical component of future India. The effort to usher in a new era of good governance has begun brightly with the enhancement of grievance and redress departments. However, it is equally important to recognize that governance is an area in which citizens have a role to play.\n\nRelated article: Consumer Rights and Protection\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

            "[CONTENT]": "The phrase \u201coffice of profit\u201d is frequently used in executive appointments made by national constitutions. The term is often mentioned in the news. Even though it is not defined per se, numerous Supreme Court judgments have outlined it. Read here to understand.\n\nIn many nations, it is against the law for the legislator to accept a lucrative position beneath the executive.\n\nThis is done to safeguard the legislature\u2019s independence and maintain the separation of powers.\n\nProfit typically refers to any perk, advantage, or beneficial outcome. In most cases, it is understood to mean financial gain, although, in some circumstances, benefits other than financial gain may also be included in its connotation.\n\nAn \u201cOffice of Profit\u201d provides dignity, prestige, or honor to the occupant and is associated with some form of patronage power or in which the holder is authorized to conduct executive functions.\n\nThe office of profit concept has been adopted from the British Parliamentary model. This concept is based on similar lines to the English Act of Settlement 1701.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat is the Office of Profit?\nWhat constitutes an office of profit?\nConstitutional provision\nSupreme Court judgments on the Office of Profit\nNews about Office of Profit\nConclusion\nWhat is the Office of Profit?\n\nAn \u201cOffice of Profit\u201d is a term used in the context of parliamentary democracy to describe a situation where a legislator or member of a legislative body holds a government position that provides them with financial benefits, perks, or other advantages. The concept is crucial to maintain the separation of powers and prevent conflicts of interest within the government.\n\nAs members of the legislature, MPs, and MLAs hold the government responsible for its actions.\n\nThe core of the office of profit law\u2019s disqualification is the idea that if lawmakers hold an \u201coffice of profit\u201d within the government, they may be vulnerable to government influence and may not carry out their constitutional duties honestly.\n\nThe idea is that an elected member\u2019s obligations and interests shouldn\u2019t conflict with one another.\n\nThus, the office of profit law just strives to uphold the Constitution\u2019s fundamental tenet of the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches.\n\nWhat constitutes an office of profit?\n\nThe definition of an office of profit has changed throughout the years as a result of successive court rulings\u2019 interpretations of the legislation, which does not explicitly state what constitutes one.\n\nA position that provides the office holder with a financial advantage, benefit, or gain has been defined as an office of profit. It doesn\u2019t matter how much of a profit this is.\n\nIn 1964, the Supreme Court ruled that the test for determining whether a person holds an office of profit is\u00a0the test of appointment.\n\nSeveral factors are considered in this determination including factors such as:\n\nwhether the government is the appointing authority\nwhether the government has the power to terminate the appointment\nwhether the government determines the remuneration\nwhat is the source of remuneration\nthe power that comes with the position.\n\nBy restricting legislators from simultaneously holding an \u201cOffice of Profit,\u201d the aim is to prevent dual loyalty, where a lawmaker\u2019s loyalty is divided between their legislative duties and their role in the executive branch of the government.\n\nIf a legislator is found to be holding an \u201cOffice of Profit\u201d in violation of the law or the constitution, they may face disqualification from their legislative position.\n\nConstitutional provision\n\nUnder the provisions of Article 102 (1) and Article 191 (1) of the Constitution, an MP or an MLA (or an MLC) is barred from holding any office of profit under the central or state government.\n\nThe article states that \u201ca person shall not be deemed to hold an office of profit under the government of India or the government of any state by reason only that he is a minister\u201d.\n\nProvisions of Articles 102 and 191 also protect a legislator occupying a government position if the office in question has been made immune to disqualification by law.\n\nIn the recent past, several state legislatures have enacted laws exempting certain offices from the purview of office of profit.\n\nParliament has also enacted\u00a0the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, which has been amended several times to expand the exempted list.\n\nThere is no bar on how many offices can be exempted from the purview of the law.\n\nSupreme Court judgments on the Office of Profit\n\nIn light of three rulings by the Supreme Court, CM will be disqualified under Section 9A of the Representation of Peoples\u2019 Act, 1951.\n\nFor the provision of commodities or the execution of any work conducted by the government, a contract must be made by that law.\n\nIn the case of CVK Rao v. Dentu Bhaskara Rao, a Supreme Court constitution panel ruled in 1964 that a mining lease is not the same as a contract for the supply of products.\n\nA three-judge panel of the Supreme Court made it plain in the case of Kartar Singh Bhadana vs. Hari Singh Nalwa & others in 2001 that a mining lease does not equate to the completion of a project that the government has undertaken.\n\nEven if the CM is declared ineligible by a third party, he may contest this decision in the high court. In this situation, and by a Supreme Court rule, the adjudication must be finished within four months.\n\nOne person may serve as a minister for six months without becoming a member by Article 164(4).\n\nNews about Office of Profit\nOffice of profit case: Earlier this year the Election Commission issued notice to the Jharkhand chief minister in reference that he held an\u201coffice of profit\u201d by granting a mining lease to himself in 2021.\nThe chief minister is accused of violating a provision of the Representation of the People Act.\nConclusion\n\nIn India, the issue of \u201cOffice of Profit\u201d has led to several high-profile controversies and legal cases over the years. The President of India, on the advice of the Election Commission, can make decisions regarding disqualification, and these decisions are subject to judicial review. The aim is to ensure that legislators do not use their positions for personal gain or to unduly influence the executive branch.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Now there will be efficient usage of public funds as they will be less prone to neglect and waste expenses.\n\nIt will remove the barriers and make the government better at administration and thus result in better governance.\n\nIt will increase the data collection and thus will help the administration in better evaluation, implementation, and better scheme outcomes.\n\nPublic policies result in better outcomes and hence public trust in administration will also increase with the reduced gap because of minimum government and maximum governance.\n\nIncreased accountability, coordination, and communication will arise from efficient file transfers and work delegation.\n\nIt will lead to better accessibility as the online resources are easier to find and thus the issues of loss and duplication will be reduced.\n\nAdditionally, it will lower the time and resource costs associated with transactions between the government and its citizens.\n\nFor Citizens\n\nIt will empower the citizens to hold the government accountable for their work and policies, and thus increased transparency will lead to an empowered citizenry, as the digital services due to their inclusivity goes beyond the geographical barriers and thus increases the scope of governance.\n\ne-Governance leads to speedy justice delivery and resolves grievances faster and thus increasing the public trust and faith in the governance system.\n\ne-Governance reduces the gap between the citizens and the government to a large extent, especially those who are vulnerable and historically lacked access like women, Dalits, and tribals.\n\nWomen-centric schemes are better implemented and the data collection, on the implementation of schemes, crimes prevailing, trends followed, etc are better gathered through e governance, same is true for other sections of society.\n\nFor Business\n\nIt helps in ease of doing business by making the compliance and performance better.

Along with this, there is a high cost of setting up the machines. The maintenance of such machines is also too high, making regular maintenance costs high. And many times the computers and the internet also break down resulting in delays in work.\n\nRural and remote areas of India still lack digital infrastructure and there persists the problem of the digital divide. Very less number of women have access to the internet, especially elderly women who don\u2019t have proper access and understanding of the digital world.\n\nIt results in the loss of interpersonal relations, communications and the personal touch is missing which many people still consider very vital. Because of this and the change in the old system shows signs of many people being reluctant to its application.\n\nThere is a lack of uniformity as the different states follow different methods, lack of authority in dealing with the e-governance system, and not all state governments are following the same policy on digitalization.\n\nMostly all the e-governance applications and websites are available in English which is not understood by all and thus results in a language barrier issue.\n\nIndia has a low literacy rate and even among that literate people very few are still not comfortable and have knowledge of information technology.\n\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nHealth: Sugamya Bharat app, aarogya setu app, vaccine tracker, electronic health record, mera aspataal, swasth Bharat app, etc.\n\nWomen: NARI portal, SHe Box, HIMMAT app, Mahila e Haat etc.\n\nEducation: Swayam Prabha, DIKSHA portal, National digital library of India, SWAYAM, etc\n\nAgriculture: Kisan call centers, Agriculture mission mode project, AGMARKNET, etc.\n\nGovernment service and monitoring: \u00a0Digital India, Aadhar, Digi Locker, UMANG, PRAGATI, e KRANTI, Lokvani, etc.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThere is an urgent need for investment both from outside and internally from the government.\n\nThere is a need for active participation in civil society and for private sector involvement in innovation and management, especially those involved in the technology and the tech giants.\n\nMake in India should be promoted as we should not rely on imports solely.

The Constitution is based on the principles of a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic, committed to democracy, the rule of law, and the welfare of its citizens.

For example Gram Sabha under the 73rd constitutional amendment and social audits under MGNREGA.\nIt results in effectiveness and efficiency by the achievement of the desired objectives through the judicious use of existing resources. For example Insolvency and bankruptcy code for the efficient resolution of disputes regarding corporate insolvencies.\nIt leads to inclusivity, as the government processes that ensure the interest of all the stakeholders in society are honored which can be seen in the form of Eklavya schools for the inclusive education of the tribal children, or the Van Dhan scheme for the economic development of the tribals engaged in the collection of the minor food produce.\nGood Governance puts an obligation on the government and its agencies to provide information and justify their decisions to the public and other institutions leading to accountability. For example, audits by CAG and INGRAM for lodging consumer grievances.\nIt helps in upholding the rule of law, a system where all citizens in the country are accountable to the laws of the country. For example, Article 21 protect individuals from the arbitrary actions of the executive and the legislature.\nIt is in the best interests of society as it is consensus-oriented and considers different people to come to a conclusion and argument. For example National education policy was a result of consensus built amongst different stakeholders.\nIt implies a government that is not opaque and its information is disseminated to the public and is transparent. For example, the Right to Information acts as a landmark act to enforce good governance.\nBecause of good governance now the quality of reacting quickly and positively has increased, leading to responsiveness. For example, PRAGATI aimed at addressing the common man\u2019s grievances.\nCharacteristics of Good Governance as per UN\n\nThere are eight essential characteristics of good governance listed by the United Nations (UN).\n\nParticipation: Involving all facets of society in governance is a crucial cornerstone. Men and women, weaker groups in society, the underprivileged, minorities, etc. are all included in this.\n\nTransparency: This refers to everyone having easy access to information, particularly those who may be impacted by the decisions made. Another crucial aspect is that all decisions are made and carried out in accordance with laws and regulations.\n\nRule of Law: Rule of law ensures the impartial implementation of equitable legal systems.\n\nResponsiveness: This suggests that institutions and processes should provide services to all parties involved quickly.\n\nConsensus-oriented: Consensus-oriented decision-making makes sure that even if everyone does not get all they want, a shared minimum can be reached by all parties that will not be harmful to anyone.\n\nInclusion and equity: Effective governance ensures an egalitarian society. In a society like this, nobody or any group feels excluded or marginalized. No one should be discriminated against, and opportunities should be given to everyone regardless of background.\n\nEffectiveness and efficiency: Good governance implies that institutions and procedures produce outcomes that satisfy societal needs while making the best use of the resources available to them.\n\nAccountability: Accountability is a crucial component of effective government. It \u00a0should apply to all parties involved, including the public, the private sector, business, non-profit organizations, and the government.\n\nBenefits of Good Governance\n\nGood governance results in efficient governance ensuring better morale amongst people and improving the overall happiness and the standard of living of the larger public.\n\nThere is better public faith and the government enjoys more trust of people enduring stability, reduces scams and corruption in the system because of accountability and transparency.\n\nIt improves the bureaucratic and administrative efficiency with healthy governance practices and control red tape and bureaucratic hurdles.\n\nIt also has a positive impact on the environment through better and judicious utilization of resources, compliance with the environmental laws, and reducing the negative impact and thereby increasing environmental security.\n\nNow the welfare becomes more inclusive and consolidated, ensuring all communities are on board. For example, good education leads to better employability, and efficient surveillance ensures improved public safety.\n\nGood governance has the most impact on the economic sector as it can ensure more investor interest in the economy and boost the economic growth. It can do cost saving by reducing the leakages, will be attracting FDI thus result in more foreign flows.\n\nChallenges to Good Governance\n\nCorruption erodes any progress and growth in the system. Extreme criminalization of politics makes it difficult to work efficiently and creates hurdles for good governance.\n\nLeft-wing extremism and internal terrorism security threats make it difficult for the government to work efficiently in rural and backward areas and improve governance.\n\nThe poor infrastructure connectivity both digitally and physically in many parts of the country makes good governance difficult.\n\nGood\u00a0governance is\u00a0being negatively impacted by the criminalization of politics and the close alliance between government officials, commercial interests, and elected officials.\n\nThe empowerment of women must be ensured in order to guarantee good governance. It is unfair that women are underrepresented in government institutions given their over 50% demographic share.\n\nAnother problem is the lack of coordination in the three wings of government, effective coordination. Proper linkages amongst the organs are required for effective functioning.\n\nThere is a lack of public faith in many activities of the government and if the citizens are hostile to the government or lack faith in its functioning, good governance cannot be achieved.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThe government should try to reduce corruption to ensure better outcomes. Politicians with criminal backgrounds must be removed from holding high offices.\n\nThere is a strong need for innovative solutions for better governance and the tech sectors should be encouraged to participate in it.\n\nCivil society groups like NGOs, women\u2019s growth, cooperatives, trade unions, etc should play an active role to ensure government accountability.\n\nCitizens must be more vigilant and law-abiding ensuring the true success of governance. They must be given access to information to sufficiently monitor all schemes and state activities.\n\nThere has to be consensus-based decision-making involving the collaborative efforts of the state, civil societies, and other organizations.\n\nThe 2nd ARC committee recommendations on citizen-centric administration suggested mandatory social audits for all programs and women\u2019s participation in economic programs. The Committee also recommended suggestion box for all government agencies, capacity building of local bodies, and impact assessment for all the programs at regular intervals.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

The court observed that custodial death is a matter of concern and it is more aggravated as it is committed by the protector of the citizens.\n\nNilabati Behera vs the state of Odisha: According to this case the state could no longer escape liability in public law and the state is under compulsion to pay the compensation.\n\nRama Murthy vs the state of Karnataka: The supreme court while upholding the fundamental rights of the prisoners identified the problem of torture and ill-treatment in prisons as an area that needs reforms.\n\nTypes of Custodial Violence\n\nCustodial violence comes in a variety of forms, which are mentioned below\n\nPhysical Violence:\u00a0by using physical force or smashing, which could leave one fatigued and afraid of dying\n\nPsychological violence: not giving them accurate information and abusing their minds. Threats and shame are other methods for accomplishing this.\n\nSexual Violence: This may involve humiliating one\u2019s dignity and verbal sexual assault. This might have a psychological effect on the victim for a very long time.\n\nReasons behind the custodial violence\n\nPolice use custodial violence to elicit confessions and secrets due to procedural pressures, as sometimes police face pressure to find the criminals to solve a case. There is a disproportionate ratio between crime rate and manpower.\n\nThere are many cases of judicial delays and such delays give more time to the police to interrogate and this sometimes leads to torture and assault. Frequently violent offenders get bail and escape the judicial process by taking advantage of the loopholes and thus police resort to such tactics.\n\nThere is a lack of proper training. Sometimes police personnel are low on human rights concepts and lack experience in scientific methods in crime investigation and interrogation of the accused involved.\n\nThe issue of custodial violence has been too politicized. The political and bureaucratic influence and the increasing public pressure sometimes lead to police taking the help of assault.\n\nSometimes it can be a result of increasing societal pressure and many times the police have to commit such violence to calm the public sentiments affected by the acts of the person in custody.\n\nSuch beatings and thrashing of the person in custody by the police can deter any potential criminal from refraining from crime and thus police resort to it to deter any future defenders.\n\nThe police sometimes also resort to violence as such activities lead to personal glorification and create appreciation and apprehension among the police officers.\n\nStrong legislation is absent, India doesn\u2019t have anti-torture legislation and has yet to criminalize custodial violence.\n\nWhy curb custodial violence?\n\nIndia is a signatory to international standards of human rights and it must also uphold those same principles in the domestic sphere. It also results in international fugitives as the absence of safeguards on custodial violence has been one of the reasons why extradition of offenders is difficult for India. For example, Vijay Mallaya.\n\nIt sometimes leads to psychological issues. Due to the intolerance by the police toward the psychological needs and issues of the person in custody, it might lead to sadism, sexual violence, social hatred, and many more.\n\nThe issue of custodial violence deprives a person of his most basic right, ie right to fair treatment by law. It tarnishes the old image as it makes the police someone to be feared rather than respected and as a result, people fear approaching them.\n\nWe need to curb custodial violence as it will uphold the procedure established by law and will enforce the fact that no one is above the law and the punishment can only be given through a procedure established by law.\n\nHow to curb custodial violence?\n\nGiven the problem of custodial deaths, technology has been proposed as a silver bullet by many.\u00a0 For example, body cameras could hold officers liable, deception detection tests, automated external defibrillators, brain mapping, and so on.\n\nThere must be more efforts to create the inquiry and try to make it a little more humane by providing training to police personnel. The police officers and the stations have to be properly trained on the topic of accountable policing.\n\nThere has to be a mandatory session for the officers, especially those who have a history of temper issues and violence and need to be put under the guidance of counseling and psychological evaluation.\n\nPolice need to have all the data and the documents of those who are in custody containing the medical conditions and also provide sufficient medical aid to those who need it to ensure proper sensitization.\n\nThere has to be action against those who take custodial violence as suggested by the Law Commission of India, and compensation should be provided to the victim and their family members in case custodial violence leads to the death of the accused.\n\nIndia can ratify the already signed UN Convention on torture in line with the national standards. And the center can enact legislation to protect the rights of those who are in custody.\n\nThere is an urgent need for third-party inspections through unrestricted and regular access to independent and qualified persons to the places of detention for inspection for constant vigilance to keep the police personnel under check.\n\nThe above-mentioned reforms should be supplemented with strong ethical policing reforms. The adoption of an effective mechanism system for police will help in reducing custodial violence in all its forms.\n\nTechnology can make policing more convenient but it can never be an alternative for compassionate policing established on trust between the police and the citizens. The need of the hour is that the government should ratify the United Nations Convention on Torture which was also recommended by the Law Commission of India in its report.\n\nRelated articles:\u00a0Prison reforms; Preventive detention; Model Prisons\u00a0Act\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

This means it does not require a constitutional amendment.\nThe Constitution has a provision for the appointment of a commission to report on the matter of administration and welfare of the Scheduled Area and Scheduled Tribes [Article 339(1)].\nThe appointment of such a commission is done by the President.\nThere is a provision of the constitution for Tribal Advisory Councils in every state having scheduled areas, to advise on matters related to the welfare of the Scheduled Tribe.\nAt present, 10 states fall under the 5th schedule i.e, having scheduled areas-\nAndhra Pradesh\nTelangana\nJharkhand\nGujarat\nChhattisgarh\nHimachal Pradesh\nMaharashtra\nMadhya Pradesh\nRajasthan\nOdisha\nCriteria for declaration of \u201cScheduled Area\u201d under the Fifth Schedule\nThe preponderance of the tribal population,\nThe compactness and reasonable size of the area,\nA viable administrative entity such as a district, block, or taluk, and.\nEconomic backwardness of the area as compared to the neighboring areas.\nAdministration of Tribal Areas\nThe 6th Schedule of the Constitution deals with the administration of the Tribal Areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.\nIt has divided the land into 04 parts and 10 areas (originally consisting of 02 parts only but later amended).\nPart I (in Assam)\nThe North Cachar Hills District\nThe Karbi Anglong District\nThe Bodoland Territorial Areas District\nPart-II (in Meghalaya)\n\u00a0The Khasi Hills District\nThe Jaintia Hills District\nThe Garo Hills District\nPart-IIA (in Tripura)\nTripura Tribal Areas District\nPart-III (in Mizoram)\nThe Chakma District\nThe Mara District\nThe Lai District\nThese tribal areas are to be administered as autonomous districts but these autonomous districts are not outside the executive authority of the concerned state.\nThe organization and reorganization of the autonomous district can be done by the Governor of the state concerned including increasing or decreasing the area and changing the boundary lines.\nIn the case of different tribes in an autonomous district, the governor is authorized to divide the district into several autonomous regions.\nTo exercise legislative and judicial functions in such areas, there are provisions for the creation of District Councils and Regional Councils.\nThe district council consists of 30 members out of which 4 are nominated by the governor and the rest are elected based on adult franchise.\nElected member of the district council holds office for 5 years and nominated enjoys the pleasure of the governor.\nCouncils hold the law-making power in certain domains such as management of forests other than reserve forests, marriage and social customs, inheritance of property, etc.\nThe Governor of the state can provide power to the councils to try certain suits or offenses.\nCouncils are empowered to impose certain specified taxes and can collect land revenue.\nThe Governor must approve the law made by the council of the State.\nOn the matters over which the council is empowered to make law, the law of state legislature over such topics can not be extended to such areas without the approval of councils.\nConcerning other matters, President with respect to the central act, and Governor with respect to the state act may direct that an act of parliament or state legislature shall not extend or shall be extended with reasonable exceptions to any autonomous district.\nException: In the case of Assam, the power of direction with respect to acts of parliament and acts of state legislature lies with Governor. In the case of Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, power lies with President in respect of acts of Parliament and with the Governor in respect of acts of the legislature of the state.\nWhy Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas are treated differently than other areas of the country?\n\nScheduled areas are inhabited by people who are socially and economically backward. Though they constitute a part of the country, it is the responsibility of the government to make special efforts needed to improve their condition. That is why the normal administration system running across the country may not be suitable for these areas as it requires special attention and effort and that is why the government has greater responsibility for these areas.\n\nIn a similar way, the Tribes of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram have not absorbed the way of life of the other people of the state with time. Somehow, the tribal areas of other states have adopted the culture of other people more or less but tribes from such northeastern states stand connected to their own traditions, culture, and custom. That is why such areas are treated differently and our constitution has provided sufficient provisions to provide them a sizable amount of autonomy to practice their own way of life without hurting the unity of the country.\n\nRead: Ladakh statehood\n\n\u00a0Article Written By: Priti Raj"

To answer these questions, read further.\n\nPreventive detention refers to taking into custody an individual who has not committed a crime yet but the authorities believe him to be a threat to law and order.\n\nThe power to make preventive detention in India comes from the constitution itself which empowers the parliament to make such laws for ensuring the safety and security of the country.\n\nThe parliament has exclusive legislative powers concerning preventive detention.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypes of Arrests\nConstitutional Provisions Related to Preventive Detention\nSome important judgments\nSafeguards provided against the misuse of Preventive Detention\nGrounds for Preventive Detention\nLegislation in India on Preventive Detention\nArguments in favor of Preventive Detention\nArguments against Preventive Detention\nWay Forward\nTypes of Arrests\n\nPunitive detention is when someone is detained due to a crime they committed. It happens following the actual commission of the crime, or at the very least following the attempt.\n\nPunitive detention is governed by various provisions in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and other specific laws related to offenses.\nThe duration of punitive detention is determined by the court judgment and the nature of the offense committed.\nPunitive detention applies to individuals convicted of criminal offenses, ranging from minor offenses to serious crimes such as murder or fraud.\nPunitive detention follows a judicial process that involves a trial, presentation of evidence, legal representation, and a judgment. The court imposes a specific sentence based on the severity of the offense.\nIndividuals subjected to punitive detention have the right to appeal against their conviction and sentence. Higher courts may review the case, and legal avenues for appeal are available.\nIndividuals undergoing punitive detention are entitled to certain human rights safeguards, including the right to legal representation, a fair trial, and protection against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nDetention to stop a person from committing additional crimes or from upholding the peace is known as preventive detention.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nConstitutional Provisions Related to Preventive Detention\n\nArticle 22(3)(b): It allows for preventive detention and puts restrictions on personal liberty to ensure state security and public order.\n\nArticle 22(4): States that no law providing for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a person for a period longer than three months. In case of extended extension, a report by the advisory board is required for sufficient cause.\n\n44th Constitutional Amendment Act: The amendment reduced the period of detention without obtaining the opinion from the advisory board from three to two months, however, this provision has yet to be implemented and thus the original period of three months continues.\n\nSome important judgments\n\nAlijav vs District Magistrate, Dhanbad: In this case, the Supreme Court of India has stated that while the criminal proceedings are related to punishing someone for an offense already done by him. The preventive detention does not relate to an offense but rather is related to the suspicion of threat.\n\nAnkul Chandra Pradhan vs UOI: Here the Supreme Court of India stated that the aim of preventive detention is not to punish but to prevent the person from doing anything detrimental to the security of the state.\n\nSafeguards provided against the misuse of Preventive Detention\n\nEvery case of preventive detention must be authorized by the law and not at the will of the executive. It means the executive cannot use this power of preventive detention arbitrarily and it has the backing of the law.\n\nPrevention detention has a fixed time and it cannot be extended beyond a period of three months. It also states that no person can be detained indefinitely.\n\nThere is a provision for early representation, the person will be given the earliest opportunity to make a representation against the preventive detention.\n\nEvery case of preventive detention must be placed before an advisory board composed of the High Court judges or persons qualified as high court judges, the case of detention must be placed before the advisory board within three months, and continued detention after three months must have the consent of the board.\n\nGrounds for Preventive Detention\n\nPrevention Detention can be made on four grounds which are,\n\nthe security of the state,\nmaintenance of the public order,\nmaintaining essential services and defense,\nand foreign affairs with the security of India.\nLegislation in India on Preventive Detention\n\nNational Security Act, 1980: This act provides for administrative detention for a period of up to one year.\n\nCOFEPOSA 1974: The act provided for preventive detention to maintain and improve foreign exchange and also to deter illegal trade.\n\nTADA 1985: The fundamental objective of this legislation is to demonstrate that it was agreed based on practice that preventive detention is required to deter and successfully counteract terrorism and violent acts.\n\nArguments in favor of Preventive Detention\n\nActs like preventive detention are required to deal with the terror elements prevailing in society such as terrorist attacks on innocent people targeting lots of lives. Having such acts tries to restrain the anti-social elements in society and protects the public from unnecessary violence.\n\nThe concept of personal liberty provided in the constitution takes an idealistic view and it becomes vital to put some reasonable restrictions for reasons of state security, public order, etc. to administer such evils.\n\nThis act is not used arbitrarily and there are only limited uses, the persons detained in these acts are not very large, and due attention is paid before preventive detention. There is also written protection provided by Habeas corpus under articles 32 and 226 in the Supreme Court and High Court.\n\nThis act becomes very important for the state as the state will have effective powers to deal with and protect the citizens in hostile activities. India is a large country having many separatist tendencies against national security and integrity and hence strict law becomes a necessity to counter subversive activities.\n\nArguments against Preventive Detention\n\nUnder Article 22 preventive detention may be implemented at any time and the Constitution also allows an individual to be detained even without a trial. Detaining anyone without a trial is a severe blow to the personal liberty of the individual.\n\nIt can result in a threat to the minorities as in the absence of proper safeguards it can be misused, especially against the Dalits and the minorities.\n\nThe long period of three months for detention which may also be extended on the recommendation of the advisory body in some instances can pose a threat to psychological and physical torture.\n\nThere is no procedure for the protection against any procedural vulnerabilities like torture and discriminatory treatment. The advisory board examines whether the detention is justified or not even before the high court, and the proceedings of the board are also confidential and accept their opinion.\n\nMany democratic countries do not have such detention laws, even the UK which brought this law to India has also repealed it in their country. It also affects the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which permits detention only in matters of public emergency that threaten the nation\u2019s life.\n\nWay Forward\n\nProtecting the limited resources while preserving the peace and order of the country is essential for a developing country like India.\n\nIndia has undergone many rebellions since independence. Though preventive detention is not completely just or fair, however, it is also not completely useless too. What is required is some changes and alterations to fit well within the constitutional articles of the right to personal life and liberty.\n\nThe Law Commission of India report 2001 reveals that more than 14 lac persons were arrested under preventive detention and the Supreme Court also clarified that the law has to be strictly constructed with procedural safeguards.\n\nIt is paramount to close the existing loopholes that permit law enforcement agencies to misuse constitutional and statutory rights.\n\nRead:\u00a0Model Prisons Act, 2023; Custodial Violence; Prison reforms\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

            "[CONTENT]": "What is Public Interest Litigation? What are the issues considered in PILs? What is the importance and the issues associated with PIL? To answer these questions, read further.\n\nPublic interest litigation (PIL) is defined as a legal action brought in a court of law for the enforcement of a public interest in which the general public or a class of the community has some interest and which could have an effect on their legal rights or responsibilities.\n\nThe term \u201cpublic interest litigation\u201d was taken from American law, where it was intended to give legal representation to previously unrepresented groups like the underprivileged, members of racial minorities, unorganized consumers, and people who were enthusiastic about environmental issues, among others.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEvolution\nSome of the issues considered in PILs includes\nSuccessful PIL Cases\nImportance of PIL\nIssues with the PIL\nRecommendations of Former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee\nWay Forward\nEvolution\nJustice Krishna Iyer first introduced the idea of public interest litigation in India in Mumbai Kamagar Sabha vs. Abdul Thai in 1976.\nHussainara Khatoon v. State of Bihar (1979) was the first PIL case to be publicly known. It focused on the inhumane treatment of prisoners and those awaiting trial and resulted in the release of more than 40,000 such prisoners. It became clear that these convicts had been denied one of their most basic rights: the right to swift justice. In succeeding cases, the same predetermined pattern was used.\nIn the case of S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, Justice P.N. Bhagawati marked the beginning of a new phase in the PIL movement. In this case, it was decided that \u201cany member of the public or social action group acting bona fide\u201d could use the Supreme Court\u2019s (Article 32) or the High Court\u2019s (Article 226) Writ Jurisdiction to seek redress against the violation of a person\u2019s legal or constitutional rights if they are unable to approach the court due to a social, economic, or other disability. By virtue of this decision, PIL became a powerful tool for the enforcement of \u201cpublic duties\u201d where an executive action or wrongdoing caused harm to the public.\nJustice Bhagwati worked hard to ensure that the idea of PILs was articulated clearly.\nM.C. Mehta v. Union of India: In a Public Interest Litigation initiated against Ganga water pollution in order to stop future contamination of Ganga water, t he Supreme Court ruled that the petitioner, who is not a riparian owner but is interested in safeguarding the lives of those who utilize Ganga water, is allowed to petition the court for the execution of statutory restrictions.\nIn the case of Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan, the court found that sexual harassment violated Article 14, Article 15, Article 16, and Article 21\u00a0of the Constitution.\nSome of the issues considered in PILs includes\nBonded labor\nChildren that have been neglected\nThe exploitation of temporary workers and failure to pay them the minimum wage\nBrutal acts against women\nPollution of the environment and disruption of the ecological equilibrium\nAdulteration of food\nPreservation of culture and legacy\nSuccessful PIL Cases\nVishaka Guidelines, published in 1997, provided employers with a definition of sexual harassment, a list of preventative strategies, and information on how to file complaints.\nM.C. Mehta v. Union of India, 1987: In an article for the constitution branch, Justice P.N. Bhagwati emphasizes the need for India\u2019s sustainable development to incorporate the polluter pays principle.\nThe SC ordered the release of 40,000 undertrials who had served the maximum amount of time in Hussainara Khatoon v. the State of Bihar.\nIn the Parmanand Katara case, the court provided hospitals total discretion to handle an emergency without concern for pending police investigations.\nIn the Sheela Barse case, the SC ordered that women prisoners be housed in separate police cells to protect them from additional abuse and suffering.\nIn the 1988 Supreme Court MC Mehta case , the court chastised local officials for allowing untreated sewage.\nThe SC emphasized the right of undertrials to be protected from being held in solitary confinement in the Sumit Batra Case.\nThe PIL assisted the SC in canceling 122 2G licenses that had been improperly granted.\nIn the Indira Sawhney case, the court ruled that once a certain group is sufficiently represented in society, the tenure of such a system should not exceed ten years.\nIn the 2014 NALSA case, the court acknowledged that those who identify as the third gender or who are transgender are entitled to fundamental rights.\nThe Shreya Singhal Case invalidated the unconstitutional detentions undertaken under Section 66A of the IT Act as a result of internet material posting.\nImportance of PIL\nPIL empowers individuals to exercise their rights and obtain justice for any wrongs.\nCitizens have the authority to file petitions and take part in the administration of justice in a participatory democracy. Because there is only a small fixed court cost associated with this, it is less expensive than the standard process.\nPIL supports the protection of a section, community, or group of people in comparable circumstances. For example, the SC prohibited private corporations from leasing forest and tribal land to others in the Samatha case in Andhra Pradesh.\nJustice is made more democratic by allowing any individual or group with the necessary resources to submit petitions on behalf of those who are unable to or lack the means to do so. For example, an ordinary citizen named Parmanand Katara brought up the problem of hospitals refusing to treat accident victims to the SC.\nThrough the judicial review, decisions made by a public authority may be contested. For instance, in the Shreya Singhal case, the SC overturned arrests made under Section 66A of the IT Act for publishing content online.\nIt aids in creating the checks and balances necessary to redress any improper executive or legislative Accountability of the government and can be used to enforce the wrongdoer\u2019s legal responsibility.\nLitigants can concentrate and produce results concerning significant societal issues.\nIt assists the judiciary in monitoring and keeping an eye on institutions for the elderly, orphanages, and prisons. Example: In the Hussainara Khatoon case, the court released defendants who had already spent the maximum amount of time allowed for their offense.\nIssues with the PIL\nPetitions without a significant issue waste the time of the courts and prolonged delays in PIL case resolution may reduce many leading judgments to purely academic status.\nThe judiciary is going beyond the scope of its authority and is unable to monitor how well its directives are being carried out.\nIn some cases, the court showed its unwillingness to take on legislative duties; in others, it provided specific instructions for formulating policy. It has been observed that PILs are given higher priority than lengthy standing cases.\nThe Judiciary already has a heavy caseload due to pending cases, and PIL petitions add to that. instead of championing public causes, PIL is being abused by those pushing for personal grievances, and thus from public interest litigation, it has become private interest litigation.\nPolitical parties frequently file petty petitions to get political attention. A decision on one topic may have a substantial impact on the rights of another group. For example, the livelihood of employees may be impacted by the decision to close a polluting industry.\nRecommendations of Former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee\n\nHe emphasized that the judiciary should not waste its time on instances involving fictitious petitions and advises against accepting situations in which a private party has a direct financial stake.\n\nHe also suggested allowing a claimant who has no connection to the case to serve as the locus standi.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThe court must always consider the impact of the PIL on such interests while determining the appropriate remedy since it may affect the rights of people who are not parties to the case.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe SC may only intervene in cases of fundamental rights abuses involving parties unable to represent themselves in court. The courts must give cases involving the rights of several people priority over those involving the rights of only one person, according to the utilitarian approach.\n\nThose who attempt to submit frivolous petitions must face penalties. Those who file baseless claims must make restitution to the opposing parties.\n\nLimitations must be placed on petitions that seek personal interests.\n\nThrough judicial intervention, degraded bond laborers, tortured defendants, and women prisoners, humiliated residents of protected women\u2019s organizations, blinded prisoners, exploited children, beggars, and many more people have received relief. The biggest benefit of PIL has been to increase government accountability for the poor people\u2019s human rights.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

Simply put, the remaining parties are listed as registered but unrecognised parties.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nComing to our topic, what do you mean by Inner-Party democracy?\n\nInner Party Democracy\n\nThe Indian Constitution does not have any explicit clauses outlining rules for controlling the behaviour of political parties there.\n\nOnly Section 29 (A) of the RPA, 1951 requires political parties to be registered. Accordingly, political parties must notify the ECI of any changes to their office holders or addresses.\n\nThe courts have noted that neither Article 324 of the Constitution nor Section 29(A) of the RPA, 1951, explicitly state that the ECI may control the internal organisations, structures, or elections of the party.\n\nThe ECI does not contest the outcome or the process that the parties followed and expects political parties to adhere to their constitution. As a result, very little information regarding internal elections is provided to the Election Commission by the parties.\n\nNegative Consequences of Inner Party Democracy\nPolitics of dynasties: Dynastic politics have become the norm and political parties are increasingly controlled by families. This is an outcome of the lack of internal party democracy.\u201d Family\u201d constituencies have emerged as a result of top party officials running their kids, daughters, and nephews in the elections.\nIncreasing nepotism: Dynasty politics govern election ticket distribution. As a result, many MPs come from political families, especially those under the age of 35.\nSelection of ineffective candidates: The parties\u2019 centralised and unclear working style has made the candidate selection process less transparent. Because of this, the party leader\u2019s favourite gets elevated above other qualified leaders, regardless of their qualifications or experience.\nSplitting up within parties: Numerous factions have developed inside parties as a result of dissatisfaction with nepotism and a lack of opportunities for advancement. This has had major repercussions on the country\u2019s parliamentary democracy\u2019s ability to operate effectively.\nIllegal Politics: Tickets are distributed based on the nebulous concept of winnability, and a competitive multi-party election process requires significant financial resources. This makes it possible for candidates with resources and political clout to compete.\nYouth alienation from politics: Internal elections are essential for career advancement. The lack of it, combined with other elements like persistent corruption, is driving young people away from politics.\nMale predominance: Though nearly all political parties have made an effort to create organisations for women in order to win their support, patriarchal systems still predominate in the bigger party structures. As a result, there are still few women in politics.\nAbsence of responsibility: Collectives of interests make up political parties. Candidates for leadership positions have the opportunity to critique the policies of their own party and offer improvements and substitutes in leadership polls. Without this platform, party policies are no longer responsible\nSolutions for reducing the negative impacts of Inner Party Politics\n\nIn order to achieve an effective relationship between the members of a political party certain steps can be taken.\n\nThey include:\n\n170th Report (1999) of the Law Commission of India\nAn entire chapter of the 170th report on election law reform was devoted to the need for rules governing internal party democracy.\nIt was highly advised that a framework for regulating the internal workings and internal party democracy of political parties be put in place.\nThis was to be accomplished by adding a new portion to the RPA of 1951, Part II-A, titled \u201cOrganization of Political Parties and Matters Incident Thereto.\u201d\nDraft \u00a0Political Parties (Registration and Regulation of Affairs) Act 2011\n\nThe proposal called for an Executive Committee for each political party, whose members would be chosen by the local committee members of the party\u2019s state units. Without accepting any nominations, the latter would choose the party\u2019s office holders from among themselves.\n\nUpdate the anti-defection law\nThe anti-defection act mandates that elected officials adhere strictly to the party whip when voting on legislation. Legislators are reduced to mere numbers on paper and are prevented from voting in accordance with their conscience, judgement, and the interests of their constituents.\nMaking the rule solely applicable to votes that affect the stability of the government, such as approval of the yearly budget or no-confidence resolutions, is one way to resolve this issue.\nGovernment committees\n\nA number of committees established by the government, including the Dinesh Goswami Committee, the Tarkunde Committee, and the Indrajit Gupta Committee, have also vociferously campaigned for increased transparency in how the political parties operate in the nation. Inner-party democracy can also be included in these suggestions.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne cannot expect a political party to uphold democratic values during the formation of a national government if those values are not upheld inside the party\u2019s internal operations. In order to implement intra-party democracy, political parties must become aware of the growing calls for electoral political reforms.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

However, it is now a multi-member body as a result of the Election Commissioner Amendment Act of 1989.\nThe commission is made up of two election commissioners and one chief election commissioner.\nElection commissioners and the chief election commissioner are appointed by the president.\nThey have a fixed term of six years, or until they reach the age of 65, whichever comes earlier.\nThey have the same status as a\u00a0Supreme Court Judge, and they receive the same pay and benefits.\nRemoval of Election commissioners\n\nChief Election Commissioner: He cannot be removed from his office except in the same manner and on the same grounds as a judge of the Supreme Court.\n\nElection Commissioner: Any other election commissioner or a regional commissioner cannot be removed from office except on the recommendation of the chief election commissioner.\n\nResignation: ECs including chief election commissioners can resign at any time or can also be removed before the expiry of their term.\n\nProcedure for Removal\n\nThe CEC can only be removed from office by Parliament using a procedure similar to that of a Supreme Court judge.\n\u00a0The CEC may be removed from their posts by a resolution approved by Parliament on the grounds of \u201cProven misbehavior or incapacity.\u201d\nRemoval needs a special majority of two-thirds of the members present and voting, as well as approval from more than half of the house\u2019s total membership.\nThe term \u201cimpeachment\u201d is not used in the Constitution to describe the removal of CEC.\n\nAlso read: Supreme Court Verdict on ECI Appointments\n\nIndependence of ECI\n\nThe CEC cannot be dismissed from his position other than in the same way and for the same reasons as a Supreme Court judge.\n\nAfter being appointed, the CEC\u2019s service requirements cannot be changed to his detriment.\nA regional commissioner or another election commissioner cannot be dismissed from their position unless the chief election commissioner recommends it.\nPowers and Functions of the Election Commission\nThe Indian Election Commission compiles and regularly updates electoral rolls, registers all eligible voters, announces election dates and schedules, and examines nomination papers.\nThe commission determines the geographic limits of electoral seats across the country based on the Delimitation Commission Act of Parliament.\nThe commission is responsible for the creation of an electronic photo identity card and the preparation of an election list.\nAll political parties must adhere to spending caps on each candidate\u2019s campaign, which are carefully monitored, and guide the post-election disqualification of sitting members of the state legislature and the Parliament.\nIt requests that the governor or president for the staff required to conduct elections. Additionally, it enrolls political parties for electoral purposes and grants them national or state party status based on the results of polls.\nIt provides advice to the governor on issues of the disqualification of members of state legislatures as well as the president on issues of the disqualification of members of Parliament.\nIn the event of rigging, booth capturing, violence, or other irregularities, the commission selects officers to conduct inquiries into complaints relating to electoral arrangements and to call off elections.\nPolitical parties are given recognition and are given election symbols by the commission.\nThey establish the code of conduct that the parties and candidates will adhere to during the election.\nThe Commission creates a schedule for political party policies for the advertisement on radio and television during election times and oversees the election infrastructure across the nation to ensure free and fair elections.\nIssues with ECI\nThe Election Commission lacks the necessary tools to control political parties. It is unable to impose internal party democracy or control party finances.\nThe rise in violence and money-driven electoral fraud, which ECI is helpless to stop, have resulted in political criminality.\nThe general public\u2019s confidence in ECI is eroded by claims that EVMs are broken, vulnerable to hacking, and incapable of recording votes.\nFalse affidavit or withholding of material information taken by a candidate in the affidavit are not grounds for contesting the election or for the part of the RPA, 1951 that deals with the rejection of nomination papers.\nPolitical parties can be registered with ECI, but they cannot be de-registered.\nThe legal, academic, administrative, and judicial requirements for Election Commission members have not been outlined in the Constitution.\nThe Constitution does not prohibit the government from appointing the retiring election commissioners again. Here independence is susceptible to being threatened.\nIn the unlikely event that the individual in charge of the commission adheres to a certain ideology, he or she may give strange instructions that destabilize politics or trigger a constitutional crisis.\nRecent Developments\n\nThe new law governing appointments to the constitutional body, the Chief Election Commissioner, and other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023 has come into implementation with the appointment of new ECs to fill up two vacancies in the three-member Election Commission of India.\n\nIn terms of the new law, the ECs will be selected by a three-member Selection Committee, comprising the Prime Minister, the Union Home Minister, and the leader of the largest party in the Opposition.\nThey will be chosen out of a shortlisted panel of names.\nThe shortlisting will be done by a committee which, according to the Act, is headed by the Union Minister for Law and Justice and includes two officials of the rank of Secretary to the government.\nElection Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023\nThe act replaces the Election Commission (Conditions of Service of Election Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991.\nIt provides for the appointment, salary, and removal of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and Election Commissioners (ECs).\nThe CEC and ECs will be appointed by the President upon the recommendation of a Selection Committee.\nThe Selection Committee will consist of the Prime Minister, a Union Cabinet Minister, and Leader of Opposition/leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha.\nRecommendations of the Selection Committee will be valid even when there is a vacancy in this Committee.\nA Search Committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary will propose a panel of names to the Selection Committee.\nEligibility for the posts includes holding (or having held) a post equivalent to the Secretary to the central government.\nThe salary and conditions of service of the CEC and ECs will be equivalent to that of the Cabinet Secretary.\nUnder the 1991 Act, it was equivalent to the salary of a Supreme Court Judge.\nWay forward\n\nElections are the cornerstone of democracy, and the ECI is crucial to that legitimacy. Therefore, to defend its autonomy, the guardian of elections itself urgently needs structural safeguards.\n\nAlong with overseeing the holding of free and fair elections, it also serves as a sort of court system for disputes between the various political parties and the current administration.\n\nThe budget of the Election Commission should be deducted from the Consolidated Fund of India. It should not be put to a vote by Parliament.\n\nBoth the Tarkunde Committee on Electoral Reform (1975) and the Goswami Committee on Electoral Reform (1990) advocated for the appointment of a commissioner as opposed to a presidential appointee.\n\nThe second ARC also recommends that a collegium consisting of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, the Law Minister, and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha recommend the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and the Election Commissioners to the President.\n\nRead: Green Elections in India;\u00a0Electoral Reforms in India\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav"

Is there any role of the Supreme Court concerning these privileges? These are some of the questions we are going to deal with in the following article.\n\nParliamentary privileges in India are a set of rights, immunities, and exemptions enjoyed by the Houses of Parliament, their committees, and their members.\n\nThese privileges are essential for the Houses to perform their functions effectively without any interference, intimidation, or obstruction. Derived from the British legal system, these privileges are part of the Indian Constitution under Article 105 (about Parliament) and Article 194 (on State Legislatures).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nParliamentary Privileges\nSource of the Privileges\nDifferent types of Parliamentary Privileges\nSignificance of the Parliamentary Privileges\nExisting Challenges\nSupreme Court stance on parliamentary privileges\nSpeaker\u2019s role in parliamentary privileges\nCodification of Parliamentary Privileges\nIn the news\nParliamentary Privileges\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nParliamentary privilege refers to rights, immunities, and exemptions enjoyed by MPs individually and collectively to discharge their functions responsibly.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSource of the Privileges\nArticle 105 for the Parliament and Article 194 for the State Legislature\nVarious laws are made by Parliament\nRules of both the Houses\nParliamentary conventions\nJudicial interpretations\nDifferent types of Parliamentary Privileges\n\nIndividual Privileges: These are the rights that each member of parliament has in his official capacity.\n\nFor instance, MPs are free to speak their minds in the House, cannot be detained in civil proceedings 40 days before or after the start of the current session of Parliament, and are not required to serve on juries.\nDuring the session of the legislature, a member cannot be arrested. Additionally, members cannot be detained 40 days before or after the session\u2019s beginning or end.\nParliamentarians have a right to free speech inside the chambers. They are not subject to any legal action as a result of their statements made in the parliament or its committees. However, it is controlled by the guidelines.\nWhen Parliament is in session, they have the option to decline to provide testimony and appear as a witness in a case that is pending in court.\n\nCollective Privileges: These are the collectively conferred privileges and are more generic.\n\nFor instance, the right to publish documents, reports, and discussions and to forbid others from doing the same.\nRight to hold private meetings, the Right to be informed of members\u2019 arrests and releases, and the authority to penalize for disrespect or violating a privilege.\nThere can be no judicial procedure served without notifying the presiding officer.\nThe Indian parliament has the right to keep outsiders out of its sessions.\nThe parliamentary privilege also includes the houses\u2019 private sessions.\nThe two houses have the authority to establish regulations for their working methods, business conduct, and work assessment.\nIn the event of a privilege violation, the parliament may suspend or expel members.\nIf a member or outsider violates a privilege, the parliament may punish them.\nThe court cannot examine the activities of the houses and committees of the parliament.\n\nAlso read: Motions in Parliament\n\nSignificance of the Parliamentary Privileges\nIt assists in ensuring the efficacy of the activities done by legislators and their independence, shielding them from unwarranted criticism.\nInternal independence should exist without interference from any outside party or person for both houses of parliament and their members to function effectively and the statutory authorities need not intervene in how the houses resolve their problems.\nGiving the privilege has no intention of elevating parliamentarians above the law instead, it is intended to give them a great opportunity to carry out their responsibilities successfully and independently, to grant them some rights to exclude outsiders, to sanction both insiders and outsiders who violate the privileges, etc.\nIt aids in upholding the members of parliament\u2019s dignity, and authority. It also honors and protects them from any interference with their ability to carry out their duties in the house.\nExisting Challenges\nLegislators can become the sole arbiters of their privileges, what constitutes a breach, and the appropriate sanctions in the event of a breach due to the breach of privilege clause. As a result of doing the judiciary\u2019s task, the legislature opposes the idea of the separation of powers.\nThe legislators\u2019 role as judges in their case in this instance raises questions about potential conflicts of interest and transgresses the fundamental right to a fair trial.\nGiven the ambiguous language of the Constitution\u2019s provisions, the precise number of privileges is unknown and, in the opinion of some jurists, even unbounded. As a result, politicians frequently abuse these privileges to stifle criticism, infringing upon the right to freedom of expression.\nSupreme Court stance on parliamentary privileges\n\nThe SC ruled that some fundamental rights are subsidiary to legislative privilege while others take precedence over it. Consequently, SC has not been very explicit on this matter.\n\n2024: A seven-judge constitution bench, led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, unanimously declared that parliamentary privileges do not shield individuals from the legal consequences of bribery.\n\nThe bench disagreed with the judgment in the 1998 PV Narasimha Rao case. The judgment in that case which granted immunity to legislators for taking bribes to cast votes has wide ramifications.\nBribery is not rendered immune under Article 105 or 194 because a legislator indulging in bribery commits a criminal act that is not essential for the function of casting a vote or giving a speech.\nSpeaker\u2019s role in parliamentary privileges\n\nThe Speaker/Rajya Sabha chairperson initially examines a privilege motion.\n\nThe privilege motion may be decided on by the Speaker/Chair or referred to the Parliamentary Privileges Committee.\nThe member in question can make a brief statement if the Speaker/Chair grants permission under applicable rules.\nThere are allegations against the Speaker of being biased towards the ruling party while deciding on a breach of Parliamentary Privileges.\nIt hurts the Principle of Popular sovereignty as the Constitution is supreme in India, not Parliament. Hence, absolute power in the form of Parliamentary privileges makes Parliament supreme instead of the people\nCodification of Parliamentary Privileges\n\nLegislators believe that codifying privileges will undermine Parliament\u2019s ability to exercise its authority. Our legislators oppose codification because it would subject the privileges to court review.\n\nShould not be codified\n\nIt would put the Indian Parliament\u2019s sovereignty in jeopardy and subject privileges to judicial review, especially when they contradict fundamental rights. It can cause delays.\nThe members should be free to carry out their duties, including having the ability to speak and vote in Parliament, without having to fear or favor anyone.\n\nShould be codified\n\nA statute to codify privileges was tacitly allowed by the Constitution. If defined, it would specify what constitutes and amounts to a violation of privileges, eliminating any ambiguity. Codification would establish the precise threshold beyond which no penalty may be meted out for privilege violations.\nCodification will permit clear interpretation in a vigorous democracy like India, where the constitution, not the Parliament, is sovereign. Australia, for instance, has established legislative privileges.\nIt is necessary to codify privileges and give the right of a citizen to free expression precedence above legislative privileges. Legislators should also behave within the bounds of the public trust placed in them to carry out their duties.\nThe Indian Parliament was compared to the British House of Commons by the Constitution\u2019s authors. India does not fall under the purview that the British Parliament is supreme, according to which \u201cParliament can do everything, it can make a man a woman and a woman a man.\u201d In India, as opposed to England, the Constitution supersedes Parliament.\nThe members are granted parliamentary privileges to ensure that the parliament runs smoothly. The parliament must respect all constitutionally given rights. The members should proceed cautiously when using their privileges and refrain from exploiting them.\nIn the news\n\n2022: The chairman of the parliamentary committee on information technology, Shashi Tharoor, informed Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla in a letter that during a CBI raid, Karti Chidambaram\u2019s \u201cextremely confidential\u201d documents regarding the panel were \u201cseized.\u201d He claimed that this was a \u201cbreach\u201d of the committee\u2019s privilege as well as the privilege of the member. In a letter to Birla, Tharoor brought up a \u201csevere breach of privilege\u201d that committee member Karti Chidambaram had experienced. Tharoor was writing in his capacity as chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information and Communications Technology.\n\n2024: A seven-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, ruled that lawmakers facing bribery charges in connection with their speech and votes in the House cannot be immune from criminal prosecution. In doing so, the Court held that claims to parliamentary privilege by lawmakers can be subject to judicial review, and only Parliament cannot have the last word on the issue.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

To answer these questions, read further.\n\nA whip is a written directive that a political party issues to its members, requiring them to vote a certain way or be present for a crucial vote. The phrase comes from the traditional British method of \u201cwhipping in\u201d legislators to to the party line.\n\nA political party has the constitutional authority to issue a whip to its legislators under the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law).\n\nThe position of \u201cwhip\u201d is not specified in the Indian Constitution, the House Rules, or a parliamentary statute. It is based on the parliamentary government\u2019s conventions.\n\nThe Speaker of the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly was ordered by the State High Court to retain the status quo in the disqualification processes launched against expelled MLAs following the anti-defection law, but the Congress chief whip has appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the 1992 KihotoHollohan case, the Supreme Court unequivocally decided that courts shouldn\u2019t become involved in disqualification cases until the Speaker makes a final decision. The SC ruled that the Tenth Schedule\u2019s use is restricted to a vote of \u201cno confidence\u201d in the government.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTypes of Whips\nFunctions of Whip\nImportance of whips\nIssues\nGlobal practices:\nWay Forward\nTypes of Whips\n\nA one-line whip is used to notify party members of a vote. If they choose not to to the party line, they are allowed to abstain.\n\nAccording to a two-line whip, members must be present in the House at the time of voting.\n\nA three-line whip was issued to members, ordering them to vote along party lines.\n\nFunctions of Whip\nThe whip is essential to the effective and efficient operation of business on the House floor. To garner support, he is tasked with making sure that party members are there in big numbers and winning their support for or against a certain cause.\nHe is responsible for maintaining the order among party representatives in the House and adhering to party lines to ensure that MPs cast their votes along party lines\nHe should make sure the MPs are aware of the party\u2019s position regarding the members\u2019 moods. He notices the evident symptoms of discontent among MPs and alerts the appropriate party leaders.\nHe or she also serves as an advisor to the party leaders and a counselor to the party\u2019s representatives in the House and is in charge of upholding the internal party structure in Parliament and acts as a binding force within the party.\nThe chief whip\u2019s primary responsibilities include scheduling the time of the session and organizing, overseeing, and managing the government\u2019s activities.\nImportance of whips\nWhips are essential to the internal structure of the parties within the legislatures.\nThe office of the Whip plays a significant role in the effective and seamless operation of the State and Central legislatures. The Whips are legitimately referred to as the party leaders in the parliament.\nGovernment whips serve as a crucial channel for information between the House speaker and the members of the governing party.\nHe also maintains close contact with the whips of the other parties on a variety of issues affecting the House as a whole, including those of the House\u2019s business.\nIssues\nA whip frequently restrains a party member\u2019s freedom of choice, preventing them from using their discretion and expressing their own opinions. A method in the United Kingdom called \u201cFree Vote\u201d allows political party members to cast their ballots however they like on particular subjects.\nA member of Parliament who disobeys the party whip risks being expelled from the House under the Anti-Defection Act.\nOnly when more than a third of lawmakers vote against a proposal, essentially dividing the party, this rule not apply.\nAnd in some situations, such as presidential elections, whips cannot order MPs or MLAs to cast their votes a certain way.\nBecause of the whip system and the anti-defection rule, MPs are reduced to a simple headcount on the House floor and in practice, this results in a propensity to form \u201cforced consensus\u201d on some subjects and legislation.\nThe fear of losing their seats prevents party members from expressing opposing opinions during debates and it is seen that regardless of how good or bad a piece of legislation is, it has been noted that members would support or oppose it based solely on party lines.\nGlobal practices:\n\nUK: In the UK, breaking the three-line whip leads to a person\u2019s expulsion from the party; however, the member may continue serving as an independent member of Parliament until the party accepts him or her back. The political structure of the government is set up so that only extremely extraordinary circumstances would allow an MP to deviate from the party line.\n\nUSA: The party whip\u2019s job is to count the number of MPs who support and oppose a particular piece of legislation. Whip tries to urge the members to vote along party lines after measuring. Since candidates are chosen for a particular seat through a primary election, they are free to express opposing opinions based on their regional interests.\n\nIndia: Party leaders in India choose the candidates for seats. Members are discouraged from defying the party line by it. Additionally, India\u2019s anti-defection laws and whip system nullify the influence of candidates\u2019 views on important subjects.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThe party members should take a longer path toward reaching an agreement on all important topics, and the issue of a whip could be restricted to only those measures that pose a threat to a government\u2019s ability to continue in offices, such as money bills or motions of no confidence.\n\nAdopt the UK\u2019s \u201cFree Vote\u201d system, in which political parties permit their members to cast their ballots any way they like.\n\nA whip system is a necessary evil to ensure stability and efficient government operations. To preserve the democratic nature of the parliamentary system of government.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

It will be chaired by the prime minister.\n\nFor the first time, it was established in 1990 by presidential order under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Council should convene at least three times per year.\n\nWhile Article 131 gives the Supreme Court exclusive authority and permits the judicial adjudication of interstate disputes. One category of such disputes may be decided by an extrajudicial tribunal under Article 262.\n\nArticle 263 on the other hand demands that administrative bodies to conduct investigations and make recommendations to prevent interstate disputes.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe country can advance only with the cooperation of the Union and the State governments. The federation\u2019s operation is loaded with difficulties. Periodic conversations and debates are important for the system to operate well.

It helps in resolving disputes.\n\nIt plays a role as a forum for conversation and debate. And as a result, it holds central and state governments more responsible for their activities.\n\nIt provides an ideal environment for discussing the needs of the people, dealing with their issues, and making decisions that benefit everyone.\n\nThe council aids in bridging the gap in trust between the federal government and the states. It served as a safety valve if not always a problem solver.\n\nInter-State Council has constitutional support, unlike similar center-state collaboration platforms like NITI Aayog, which gives the states a stronger footing.\n\nThe necessity for conversation becomes more critical when many political parties are in charge of the federal government and individual states. States can voice their issues on this platform.\n\nThe council also serves as a vehicle for fostering trust between the two administrative units, much like interactions between states, the centre, and union territories.\n\nIn the event of a crisis, the Inter-State Council aids in maintaining amicable relations between the two. The center must pay attention to the demands of the states.\n\nThe Centre has the authority to engage with other governments, and sponsoring organizations. Inter-State Council will give them a platform to do so.\n\nFunctions of Inter-State Council\nInvestigating and offering guidance regarding potential issues between the States.\nCreate a solid institutional foundation for cooperative federalism in the nation. And by holding regular meetings, activate the council and zonal councils.\nIt looks at and talks about issues that interest all the states in the union.\nIt makes recommendations on any such topic for better policy concerning that topic.\nCreates a sound system to track the application of the recommendations they make.\nIssues with the Inter-State Council\n\nOne of the most significant issues is the council\u2019s underutilization. In the last 22 years of its existence, the Council has only convened 10 meetings and has moved slowly toward resolving inter-State conflicts.\n\nIt is only a consultative organization with no obligations to the state or the federal government. As a result, governments frequently disregard their advice.\n\nIt lacks the autonomy necessary for efficient operation as well as technical and managerial professionals. The lack of civil society participation in the council makes it less cooperative and participatory.\n\nThere is no permanent constitutional body like the Inter-state council. If it seems to the President that the establishment of such a council will serve the interests of the public, he may do so at any moment.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe purpose of the Inter-State Council was to coordinate between States on matters such as river water conflicts, issues with the placement, financing, and implementation of large-scale projects, ecosystem management, the growth of tourism, etc. On these fronts, the council has not been able to make much progress. As a result, it needs to be strengthened to be able to carry out its purpose.\n\nTo properly address the issues and challenges relevant to the current times, the council must meet frequently and for a set period of time.\n\nInstead of being just an advising body, the council should have additional power and jurisdiction under Article 263.\n\nIn addition to the All India Services cadre, the council should have professionals from the fields of law, management, finance and economics, and political science.\n\nOne of the key recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission was that the council be constituted as a permanent body.\n\nIt is necessary to first establish a regular meeting schedule for the Inter-State Council in order for it to become the main institution for settling inter-state disputes.\n\nIt needs to be strengthened as a platform for exchanges between the centre and the states on not just administrative, but also political and legislative issues.\n\nInter-State Council should give more representation to NGOs, the corporate sector, and subject-matter experts to reflect their representations.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

To answer these questions, read further.\n\nState funding of elections means that the government provides funding to political parties or candidates to participate in elections.\u00a0\n\nThe Election Commission of India recently informed the government about its opposition to the state funding of elections. The commission believes that it would be difficult to regulate candidate spending. It goes beyond what the state already permits.\n\nElections that are \u201cstate-funded\u201d are those in which the government contributes money to political parties or candidates for them to run in elections.\n\nGiving money directly to political parties or candidates is referred to as direct funding. Subsidies and other forms of access are examples of indirect funding.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRecommendations on State Funding for Elections\nBenefits of the State Funding of Elections\nThe argument against State Funding of elections\nWay forward\nRecommendations on State Funding for Elections\n\nSeveral government studies have already examined state funding of elections, including\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Indrajit Gupta Committee on State Election Funding (1998)\n\nTo create a level playing field for parties with limited resources, the Indrajit Gupta Committee recommended state funding of elections in 1998.\nThe Committee advised placing two restrictions on state funding.\nFirstly, only national and state parties with a symbol should receive state funding. Independent candidates should not.\nSecondly, only recognized political parties and their candidates should get short-term state funding in kind in the form of specific infrastructure.\nThe Committee noted that at the time of the report, the nation\u2019s economic climate was only conducive to partial, not complete, public funding of elections.\n\nLaw Commission Report on Electoral Law Reform (1999)\n\nAccording to the Law Commission of India\u2019s 1999 report, state funding of elections is \u201cdesirable\u201d as long as political parties are not allowed to accept money from other sources.\nAdditionally, it strongly recommended that the appropriate regulatory framework should be put in place.\nThe Commission agreed with the Indrajit Gupta Committee that, given the economic situation of the nation at the time, only partial public assistance was practicable.\n\nThe National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution, 2001\u00a0\n\nIt did not endorse state funding of elections.\nBut it agreed with the 1999 Law Commission report that there is a need for an appropriate framework for the regulation of political parties.\nIt needs to be implemented before the state funding is taken into consideration.\n\nSecond Administrative Reforms Commission (2008)\n\nThe Second Administrative Reforms Commission\u2019s \u201cEthics in Governance\u201d report from 2008 advocated partial state funding of elections to cut down on \u201cillegitimate and excessive funding\u201d of election costs.\nBenefits of the State Funding of Elections\n\nCandidates with questionable histories often succeed despite their reputations in large parts because they can afford to do so. State funding will put an end to this practice.\n\nSince candidates won\u2019t be overly dependent on the party for funding, parties will become more democratic internally.\n\nState funding ensures that some influential people or groups don\u2019t have undue influence over electoral processes.\n\nA level playing field can enable the promotion of healthy competition by ensuring equality between large, well-known political parties and small parties and independent candidates.\n\nIt can break up the corporate-political connection that results from the need for funding to win elections. If political parties are not financially influenced by the huge corporate sector, citizen-centric decisions will be encouraged.\n\nEquitable funding distribution among all candidates will ensure fairness in pre-election spending.\n\nPublic funding can increase transparency in the party and thereby help curb corruption.\n\nWhen elections are held fairly, the chosen candidates maintain the principles of openness, responsibility, and honesty, among other things, bringing about good governance.\n\nIt is unreasonable to expect the majority of the population in a nation with a low per capita GDP to contribute money to political parties.\n\nThe argument against State Funding of elections\n\nThe amount of money spent by the government on important goals like nutrition, education, and health is incredibly small. Funds being diverted to finance elections may hinder state welfare programs and the development of the weaker sections.\n\nThe gap between political leaders and average citizens would widen as a result of state sponsorship.\n\nElections funded by the state won\u2019t stop parties from lobbying and receiving illicit additional cash from the business world. This will lessen the purpose of state funding for elections.\n\nIt will be challenging for the state to finance elections with a fiscal deficit of GDP.\n\nPublic funding may influence many people to enter politics solely to receive state subsidies rather than run for office and engage in development work.\n\nIn India, elections are held on a massive scale, and keeping track of expenses in the digital age is exceedingly difficult. Procedures for funding elections need to be drastically changed.\n\nThe time is not yet right to choose public funding of elections unless fundamental reforms like decriminalizing politics, comprehensive electoral finance reforms, robust transparency, audit, and strict legal framework for the enforcement of anti-corruption laws are appropriately implemented.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe limit of Rs. 2000 on cash contributions presents a chance for the infiltration of illicit funds into elections. This should be completely stopped. Even payments of Rs. 2000 should be made through bonds or online.\n\nAdditionally, a yearly audit by CAG will help to eliminate black money and secure the donors\u2019 identities.\n\nA close examination of election expenses incurred by parties and candidates is required. For this reason, a separate regulatory body can be created.\n\nThe idea of a national election fund, as put forth by the former chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy, shall also be taken into account. This fund would allow contributions from all donors.\n\nThe money then goes to the parties according to the results of the elections or any other principle that all parties would agree upon.\n\nTo reduce \u201cillegitimate and wasteful funding\u201d of election costs, the 2nd ARC (2008 report) suggested partial state funding of elections.\n\nHowever, the focus should be on strictly enforcing the current restrictions. And limiting the use of black money in elections to maintain free and fair elections until all aspects of State finance have been addressed.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

Of course, the Cabinet has the right to evaluate these choices.\n\nFeatures of the Cabinet Committees:\nInstitutional measures like the Cabinet Committee are in place to lighten the strain on the Cabinet.\nThey are Extra-Constitutional in emergence, meaning they are not listed in the constitution. The Rules of Business call for their establishment.\nThe Constitution\u2019s Article 77(3), which provides that the President \u201cshall make regulations for the more convenient conduct of the business of the Government of India, and the allocation among Ministers of said business,\u201d gives rise to these provisions.\nThey come in two forms:\nStanding (Permanent)\nAd-Hoc (Temporary)\nThe Prime Minister appoints members to the Cabinet\u2019s Standing Committees and specifies their specific responsibilities. He has the authority to change the number of committees (E.g. added two committees in 2019). Because of this, their number, nomenclature, and makeup change with time.\nThey can have three to eight members. Typically, they are limited to Cabinet Ministers. Though non-cabinet Ministers are not excluded from membership.\nThe 1961 Government of India Transaction of Business Rules governs how Indian executives conduct business.\nThey comprise senior Ministers in addition to the Ministers in charge of the relevant subjects.\nThe Prime Minister always serves as the committee\u2019s chair when he is a member of it.\nThe Home Minister or the Finance Minister frequently serves as the chairman of other Cabinet committees.\nThey make judgments in addition to resolving problems and developing ideas for the Cabinet\u2019s consideration. The Cabinet can, however, reconsider its choices.\nAdvantages of Cabinet Committees:\nThey are a method of organization to lessen the heavy workload of the Cabinet. They support effective decision-making.\nIn-depth policy analysis and efficient coordination are made possible. The specialist\u2019s opinions can be consulted while formulating policies.\nThey support the concept of collective responsibility by preserving it. And the government\u2019s stance is reflected in its decisions.\nThe committees enable the effective use of both human and financial resources.\nThese committees are built on the division of labor principle, which promotes the effective use of human resources.\nThey facilitate intergovernmental and departmental coordination.\nIt prevents ministers from acting arbitrarily and maintains the PM\u2019s control over the cabinet and administration.\nFor legislative matters where the allocation of business rules falls under the purview of two or more ministries, all ministries are asked to provide a cabinet note for the draft law.\nThe Cabinet committee makes recommendations based on the consensus of various interest groups.\nSetting the agenda for policy discussions aids in the formulation of government policy and enhances policy debate with various high-stakeholder groups and the current administration and the representation of different problems before making decisions.\nCriticism of Cabinet Committee:\nAs laws were passed through Cabinet committees without their advice, their importance was fading. Consider farm bills.\nAd hoc cabinet committees are becoming fewer in number, which prevents them from micro-analyzing government decisions.\nSince the PM leads the majority of Cabinet Committees, the importance of other ministers is automatically diminished. He might need to step down from the government if the ministers disagree with him on an issue that is against the Council of Ministers.\nThe cabinet committees don\u2019t hold regular meetings and the expert opinions are only taken into account when their political ideologies align with that of the ruling party. Independent Ministers of States are infrequently appointed.\nConflict of interest cases is brought about by broad jurisdiction. Some ministries have more concentrated power, such as the MHA and MoF, which have the authority to control NGO funding issues.\nThere are many instances where a single topic converges to two or more ministries, creating a power struggle between the ministries. Because of this, bureaucratic paralysis in decision-making flourishes.\nNo in-depth exploration of the issues. It has frequently been observed that committees tend to shape the issues that have been allocated for examination rather than bringing to light the underlying problem.\nSECOND ARC\n\nThe Commission noted that because there are so many Groups of Ministers, many of them are unable to meet regularly to finish their job, which causes considerable delays on many important matters.\n\nThe Commission believed that using the institution of a Group of Ministers more sparingly would result in more effective coordination, especially if they are given the authority to make decisions on behalf of the Cabinet with deadlines set for completing the work assigned to them.\n\nThe Commission suggested that steps be taken to ensure that the Group of Ministers\u2019 current coordination mechanism operates well and aids in problem resolution as soon as possible. judicious but efficient usage of a Group of Ministers with a specific mandate and time limit.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThe PM\u2019s responsibility is to only chair important committees. The functions of the Group of Ministries and the Cabinet Committee should be equally distributed. There should be a balance between the group of ministers and the cabinet committees. Any of these in excess hinder effective government.\n\nIndia should adopt the procedures used by the Cabinet Committees of New Zealand and Britain to protect the secret of the government\u2019s future final policy and prevent market speculation. For instance, there was market speculation before the announcement of the PLI incentive sector.\n\nMeetings of the Cabinet Committees should be held regularly. For administrative simplicity and policy formation, the Committees should promote apolitical ideas.\n\nCabinet and Cabinet Committees should have a relationship based on the saying \u201cSwim or Sink Together.\u201d\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

To answer all these questions, read further.\n\nThe Model Code of Conduct is a series of regulations issued by the Election Commission to monitor the political parties and candidates ahead of elections to provide free and fair elections.\n\nFrom the day the election calendar is announced until the day the results are revealed, the Model Code of Conduct is in operation. The Model Code of Conduct is not legally enforceable.\n\nKerala\u2019s state assembly elections in 1960 marked the debut of MCC. It was largely supported by all parties in the Lok Sabha general elections of 1962, and it remained so in future general elections.\n\nTo control the \u201cparty in power\u201d and stop it from obtaining an undue advantage during elections, the Election Commission inserted a section in 1979.\n\nThe Supreme Court ordered the Election Commission to include election manifesto guidelines in the MCC for the 2014 general elections.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nApplication of the Model Code of Conduct during Elections and Bye-Elections:\nSignificance of Model Code of Conduct:\nModel Code of Conduct includes provisions covering:\nGeneral Guidelines:\nMeetings:\nProcessions:\nElection Day:\nObservers:\nParty in power:\nElection manifestos:\nArguments to make Model Code of Conduct Legally Binding:\nArguments in favor:\nArguments against:\nShortcomings of Model Code of Conduct:\nWay Forward\nApplication of the Model Code of Conduct during Elections and Bye-Elections:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies. Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nThe model code of conduct is applicable across the nation during general elections for the House of People (Lok Sabha).\n\nThe code is in application throughout the State during general elections for the Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha).\n\nThe code would only be applied in the territory of the concerned Constituency during bye-elections if the constituency includes State Capital, Metropolitan Cities, or Municipal Corporations.\n\nIn all other cases, the MCC would be enforced in the entire district(s) covering the Constituency going for bye-elections.\n\nSignificance of Model Code of Conduct:\n\nThe Model Code of Conduct works to create a level playing field for political parties to carry out free and fair elections as required by Article 324. It reduces efforts by giving political parties the same set of instructions consistently.\n\nElections are conducted smoothly thanks to instructions given to voters, polling places, and political parties. For instance, only voters and those with a valid polling place pass are permitted entry.\n\nOver the years, political parties from all sides have generally abided by the word and spirit of the Model Code of Conduct, showing unquestionable legitimacy.\n\nEliminating undue influence from the ruling party, for example, by forbidding new \u201cBig ticket\u201d announcements, bribes, etc., and judicial use of funds by forbidding the ruling party from using public funds for political campaigns.\n\nIt forbids candidates from using caste and religion-based slogans and thus results in harmony and upholding the law and order of the country.\n\nIt ensures an equal playing field for the opposition party. For instance, the ruling party cannot monopolize public parks and other areas.\n\nThe ruling party shouldn\u2019t exert its influence over voters, elections, or rival political parties. The organizers of two or more candidates should get in touch to make sure the processions do not collide.\n\nModel Code of Conduct includes provisions covering:\nGeneral Guidelines:\n\nPolitical parties may only be criticized in terms of their policies, programs, work history, and accomplishments.\n\nActivities including buying votes, intimidating voters, criticizing candidates based on unverified allegations, and appealing to caste and community sentiments are all forbidden.\n\nMeetings:\n\nFor the police to make the necessary security preparations, parties must give proper notice of the location and time of any meetings to the local police authorities.\n\nProcessions:\n\nIf two or more candidates intend to march down the same path, organizers must make arrangements in advance to prevent a conflict. It is forbidden to carry and burn the effigies of anyone affiliated with rival political parties.\n\nElection Day:\n\nAppropriate badges or identity cards should be issued to all authorized party employees at polling places.\n\nVoters must receive identity cards from them that are printed on plain (white) paper without any symbols or party or candidate names. Only voters and those with a valid polling place pass from the EC are permitted entry.\n\nObservers:\n\nThe EC will nominate observers to whom any candidates may report issues with the way the election is being conducted.\n\nParty in power:\n\nIn 1979, the Model Code of Conduct introduced constraints that governed the actions of the party in power.\n\nElection manifestos:\n\nThese rules, which were added in 2013, forbid parties from making pledges that have an excessive impact on voters and recommend that manifestos include information about how pledges will be fulfilled.\n\nArguments to make Model Code of Conduct Legally Binding:\nArguments in favor:\n\nIn 2013, the Standing Committee suggested that the MCC be included in the RPA 1951 and made legally obligatory.\n\nThis will contribute to better deterrence between political parties and fewer code infractions overall.\n\nArguments against:\n\nIn the opinion of the ECI and several other independent experts giving the MCC statutory backing is not preferred.\n\nEach claimed offense will be heard by the court up to the Supreme Court. Elections typically take 45 days to finish, which is too little time compared to the court system\u2019s inadequate delays.\n\nThe Indian Penal Code of 1860, the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1973, and the Representation of the People Act of 1951 all contain provisions that can be used to enforce various MCC clauses.\n\nCurrently, to enforce MCC, the Election Commission uses the special powers granted to it by Article 324 of the Constitution.\n\nThe Indian Penal Code, 1860, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and the Representation of the People Act, 1951 all have provisions that can be used to enforce specific MCC clauses.\n\nShortcomings of Model Code of Conduct:\n\nSocial media has made the line between private and public.\n\nImplementing MCC has become difficult thanks to modern methods like live webcasting, making election-related content go \u201cViral,\u201d using celebrities as \u201cinfluencers,\u201d etc. leading to a blurring of the line between them.\n\nThe Election Commission lacks the resources and surveillance capabilities to enforce and penalize MCC violations on social media. On the other hand, Foreign entities manage digital businesses like Facebook.\n\nIn the digital age, it is challenging to follow money trails and poll expenditures. Many times, political parties\u2019 proxies handle expenditure. And digital media is a powerful source of malicious, unconfirmed fake news.\n\nClosed systems, such as Whatsapp, which is the biggest social media platform in the nation, are not covered by the electoral commission\u2019s rules.\n\nThe code merely gives recommendations for candidates, it does not specify what the ECI may do with government agencies and political parties.\n\nFor instance, the abrupt transfer of top officials employed by State governments according to an Election Commission order affects the state\u2019s administrative functioning.\n\nRecently ECI ordered Kerala\u2019s government to stop selling supply kits that included things like grains, lentils, and cooking oil. Amid an ongoing pandemic, this choice might not be sensible.\n\nAccording to experts, the ruling party has a compliance deficiency.\n\nThe lack of compliance in the 2019 elections is a reflection of both the political parties disrespect for the MCC and the ECI\u2019s incapacity to maintain its constitutional advantage through ongoing monitoring and tough enforcement.\n\nDue to the MCC\u2019s voluntary nature, the election commission mechanism must maintain its political neutrality.\n\nThe MCC\u2019s illegal nature reduces parties\u2019 sense of threat. Sometimes, execution certainty and ambiguous implementation methods coexist. A lack of awareness among the voters regarding the nature and enforcement of MCC leads to poor reporting of violations to EC by voters.\n\nWay Forward\n\nCandidates who engage in election misconduct are not subject to disqualification by the Election Commission. In the best-case scenario, it might order the registration of a case.\n\nEstablishing special fast-track courts could help resolve instances involving election MCC violations more quickly.\n\nThe Law Commission noted in its report on electoral reforms from 2015 that the MCC only comes into effect from the time the Commission announces elections.\n\nBefore that, the ruling party can publish their advertisements which can give them an undue advantage and disadvantage to the other party candidates.\n\nHence, Government-sponsored advertisements should be restricted for a period of up to six months before the expiration date of the House or Assembly.\n\nThere is a need to establish fast track court or tribunal for MCC violation cases.\n\nMore technological resources, such as AI-based systems, can be used to halt violations on social media sites.\n\nFor instance, with the help of the internet app cVIGIL, voters can alert election officials immediately to any MCC infractions.\n\nThe Election Commission should be given more autonomy, similar to CAG, as this will enable it to take tougher action against influential politicians.\n\nIt is possible to consider giving MCC statutory support without impairing the EC\u2019s authority.\n\nArticle written by Chetna Yadav."

In 1948-1949, language independence movements were once again active.\n\nThere was the Samyukta Maharashtra and Maha Gujarat movement, which worked to bring together the Kannada-speaking populations of Madras, Mysore, Bombay, and Hyderabad.\n\nAlso read: Maharashtra-Karnataka Border Dispute\n\nFormation of Andhra state\n\nThe Congress was urged to put into effect an earlier decision in support of linguistic states by Telugu speakers.\n\nThey employed several strategies, such as petitions, speeches, street marches, and demonstrations, to further their interests.\n\nA well-known independence fighter named Potti Sriramulu started a fast on October 19, 1952, and regrettably, he passed away on December 15, 1952, as a result of his commitment to the cause of a distinct Andhra.\n\nIn Andhra, rioting, demonstrations, hartals, and violence occurred as a result of the uproar caused by his death.\n\nViolent protests against Andhra secession became known as the Vishalandhra movement. On December 19, 1952, then-Prime Minister Nehru finally made the announcement regarding the creation of a distinct Andhra State.\n\nFormation of State Reorganisation Committee\n\nThe effort to create further states along linguistic lines in other regions of the nation was sparked by the creation of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nTherefore, in August 1953, Nehru established the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC), which included Justice Fazl Ali, K.M. Panikkar, and Hridaynath Kunzru, to examine the entire issue of the restructuring of the states of the Union \u201cobjectively and dispassionately.\u201d\n\nThe majority of the linguistic principle was acknowledged by the committee, which also suggested redrawing state boundaries.\n\nThe State Reorganisation Committee\u2019s suggestions were approved by the then administration.\n\nIn November 1956, the States Reorganization Act was finally approved by the legislature.\n\nIt provided for fourteen states and six centrally controlled areas.\n\nSRC opposed the division of Bombay & Punjab;Therefore, Maharashtra, where massive rioting occurred, was the location with the strongest response to the SRC report.\n\nLater years\n\nThe linguistic reorganisation of India was essentially finished after more than ten years of nonstop conflict and popular efforts. But afterwards, a number of new developments emerged.\n\nFormation of Sikkim\n\nSikkim was a \u201cProtectorate\u201d of India at the time of its independence.\n\nIt indicated that it was neither a full sovereign nation nor an independent state like other states within India.\n\nWhile Sikkim\u2019s Chogyal Monarch controlled its domestic administration, India handled the country\u2019s defence and diplomatic affairs.\n\nThe residents of the state were dissatisfied with this arrangement and desired a democratic system of government.\n\nThe Lepcha-Bhutia community was a minority and made up the bulk of the state\u2019s population.\n\nBoth the heads of the two communities and the Indian government offered their support to the state\u2019s citizens in this cause.\n\nThe Sikkim Congress won the most votes in the 1974 assembly elections and supported closer ties to India.\n\nThe Assembly initially requested \u201cAssociate State\u201d status before passing a formal resolution of unification with India in 1975.\n\nA quick referendum that followed secured the assembly\u2019s support of its request for integration. This request was granted by the Indian Parliament, who recognised it as a state.\n\nLiberation of Goa\n\nIn 1947, the British Empire\u2019s continuous reign came to an end. Portugal, who had held Goa, Diu, and Daman since the sixteenth century, steadfastly resisted leaving these areas.\n\nPortuguese misgovernance repressed the people of Goa and deprived them of fundamental civil rights. Additionally, forced religious conversions were practiced by the Portuguese.\n\nThe Indian government initially made an effort to persuade the Portuguese to leave these areas and take into account the locals\u2019 popular uprisings.\n\nEventually, on December 18, 1961, as part of Operation Vijay, Indian forces crossed the border into Goa, and on December 19, 1961, the Portuguese finally submitted to them.\n\nIn 1987, Goa was admitted as a state to the Indian Union.\n\nReorganisation of States in Modern Times\n\nDue to further demands of inhihabitants of various areas , other new states were formed.\n\nUttarakhand\n\nThe 9th of November 2000 saw the separation of Uttar Pradesh into Uttarakhand, formerly known as Uttaranchal, which became India\u2019s 27th state.\n\nThe 70-year struggle by the inhabitants of the hilly area for an independent state had finally been successful.\n\nLack of development in a geographically distinct region 93% of the land is hilly, and 64% of the overall area is forest and rising unemployment sparked the long-standing call for a separate state.\n\nThe process began in 1930 when hill area people filed a motion by majority vote requesting an independent state of Uttarakhand.\n\nThe Uttarakhand Rajya Parishad was established later in 1973 and served as a venue for the fight for statehood. In 1979, this changed became Uttaranchal Kranti Dal.\n\nLater in 1994, the then-CM Mulayam Singh Yadav established a committee to assess Uttarakhand\u2019s demands. The committee was in favour of the state\u2019s establishment.\n\nOn November 9, 2000, Uttaranchal, which would later be renamed Uttarakhand, became the 27th state of the union.\n\nJharkhand\n\nThe aspirations for autonomy persisted in Jharkhand, the tribal region of Bihar that included Chhota Nagpur and the Santhal Pargana.\n\nNumerous significant traditional tribes, like the Santhal, HO, Oraon, and Munda, are concentrated in this area.\n\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, a push for a separate state began as education and contemporary activity extended throughout the tribal area.\n\nThe demand for a separate state was later advanced by other tribal organisations and movements, including the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, led by Shibu Soren.\n\nFinally after prolonged struggle for their separate state demand, the central government made Jharkhand-28th state of India on November 15th 2000.\n\nTelengana\n\nTelangana and Hyderabad state were combined to form the Indian Union on September 17, 1948.\n\nIt is well known that the States Reorganization Commission (SRC) opposed the concept of combining Telangana with Andhra Pradesh and offered a number of protections to preserve the interests of the local population for some time.\n\nIn 1956, Telangana and Andhra were combined to become Andhra Pradesh. The Telengana Praja Samiti, led by Marri Channa Reddy, started an agitation in the area in 1969. Long periods of time passed during the conflict with no breakthrough.\n\nTelangana finally became the 29th Indian state in 2014, putting an end to years of delays.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are still unmet requests for state formation based on a variety of factors, including ethnicity, lack of development, and administrative difficulties.\n\nDemands for separate states on a variety of grounds demonstrate that there are other means of bringing people together besides language.\n\nFollowing years of indifference and backwardness, some people now desire the preservation of their ethnic culture in the form of a separate state, while others desire improved development.\n\nArticle written by : Jis John Sebastian"

Buy goods directly from the producers, thus removing middlemen. It will deliver items at lower costs to consumers.\nThen there are producers\u2019 cooperative groups, which provide access to raw materials, tools, machinery, etc. This preserves the interests of small producers.\nHandloom societies like APPCO, Bayanika, Haryana Handloom, etc, are examples of producers\u2019 cooperative societies.\nAmul is one of the most well-known cooperative brands in the nation. This was born out of the 36 lakh milk producers in Gujarat. This controls the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation.\nA cooperative marketing group was created by small producers and manufacturers that were having trouble selling their goods on their own.\nHistory of Co-operative movement in India\nPre-Independence:\nThe first cooperatives were established in Europe to help the region\u2019s credit-starved citizens as an independent, self-managed people\u2019s movement with no involvement from the government.\nTo lessen the suffering of the poor farmers, especially the harassment by moneylenders, British India imitated the Raiffeisen-style cooperative movement in India.\nWhen the farmers of Pune and Ahmednagar led a protest against money lenders, the phrase \u201ccooperative societies\u201d was coined.\nThe\u00a0first credit cooperative society was formed in Banking in the year 1903\u00a0with the support of the Government of Bengal.\nThe Cooperative Credit Societies Act of India was enacted in 1904.\nIn\u00a01912, another Cooperative Societies Act was passed to\u00a0rectify some of the drawbacks of the earlier law.\nCooperation became a State subject in 1919.\nLand Mortgage Cooperative Banks were established in 1938to provide loans initially for debt relief and land improvement.\nReserve Bank of India started refinancing cooperatives for Seasonal Agricultural Operations in 1939.\nThe Multi-Unit Cooperative Societies Act was passed by the government of British India in 1942 to address cooperative societies with members from more than one province.\nPost-Independence:\nAfter independence,\u00a0cooperatives became an integral part of the Five-Year Plans.\nLike agriculture,\u00a0cooperation is on the concurrent list.\nThe National Development Council (NDC) suggested a national cooperative strategy as well as staff training and the creation of cooperative marketing societies in 1958.\nNational Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC), a statutory corporation, was set up under the National Cooperative Development Corporation Act, of 1962.\nThe Multi-State Cooperative Organisations Act was passed by the Indian Parliament in 1984. This is an effort to consolidate the numerous laws governing the same kinds of societies.\nThe government of India announced a\u00a0National Policy on Co-operatives in 2002.\nThe Constitution (Ninety Seventh Amendment) Act of 2011 on cooperatives aims to promote cooperative economic activity, which in turn aids rural India\u2019s advancement.\nIn Part III of the constitution, after the words \u201cor unions\u201d the words \u201cCooperative Societies\u201d was added.\nThe state shall endeavour to foster voluntary formation, autonomous functioning, democratic control, and professional management of the cooperative societies, according to a new Article 43B that was added to Part IV.\nAfter Part IXA of the constitution, Part IXB was inserted to accommodate state vs centre roles.\nThe NCDC\u2019s youth-friendly \u201cYuva Sahakar-Cooperative Enterprise Support and Innovation Scheme\u201d was introduced by the Union Agriculture Ministry to encourage young people to start cooperative businesses.\nNCDC recently started\u00a0Mission Sahakar 22, which aims to double farmers\u2019 income by 2022.\nCharacteristics of Cooperative Societies\n\nDemocratic equality is upheld in cooperative societies.

A cooperative society is a voluntary society, both to join and to leave.\nProfessional Management: All cooperatives must be run horribly and competently. Periodic audits must be carried out. A central Registrar is in charge of the regulation.\nNo financial risks: Cash and direct transactions are the fundamental modes of operation for cooperatives. Other than banking cooperatives, no one else offers credit. This guards them against losses brought on by poor loans. Therefore, it can be claimed that joining a cooperative is an excellent way to minimize financial risk.\nObjective: Cooperative societies\u2019 main goals are to aid individuals in navigating difficult financial situations and to enlist the aid and support of their local communities. This improves ties within the community.\nIndependent body: The Indian government recognizes a registered cooperative society as a separate legal person. It has the authority to choose what is best for its constituents.\nDistribution of Profits: In the cooperative sector, excess goods or earnings are generated and fairly dispersed among the members by their respective shares.\nOne vote per member: As we said, cooperatives run on principles of democracy. Every cooperative has a head managing committee, members of which are elected by common members.\nMutual benefit: People with middle- and low-income levels can always benefit from cooperatives. They develop a sense of mutual trust while assisting one other in making greater gains than their typical incomes.\nConstitutional Provisions\nArticle 19 states that the Right to form cooperative societies is a fundamental right.\nArticle 43-B provides for the promotion of cooperative societies (DPSP) and states that the State shall endeavour to promote voluntary formation, autonomous functioning, democratic control, and professional management of co-operative societies.\n243ZH deals with Definitions.\n243ZI deals with the incorporation of Co-operative Societies.\n243ZJ deals with the number and term of members on board and its office bearers.\n243ZK-Election of members of the board.\n243ZL-Suppression and suspension of the board and interim management.\n243ZM-Audit and accounts of co-operative societies.\n243ZN-Convening of general body meetings.\n243ZO-Right of a member to get information.\n243ZP-Returns.\n243ZQ-Offences and penalties.\n243ZR-Application to multi-state co-operative societies.\n243ZS-Application to Union Territories.\n243ZT-Continuance of existing laws.\nTypes of Cooperative Societies in India\n\nBased on the nature of activities performed, co-operatives can be categorized as:\n\nImportance of the Cooperative Society in India\n\nIt provides agricultural credits and funds where state and private sectors have not been able to do very much.\n\nIt provides strategic inputs for the agricultural sector; consumer societies meet their consumption requirements at concessional rates.\n\nIt helps to overcome the constraints of agricultural development.\n\nA cooperative society plays a key role in representing the needs of its members in a larger market and fostering their independence. It fosters social trust, a broad socioeconomic uplift, and a propensity to support our local communities.\n\nAdvantages of Cooperative Society\nThe formation of a cooperative society is very easy compared to a joint stock company.\nPersons having common interests can form a co-operative society.\nDemocratic governance is the norm in cooperative societies. The members voted to choose the delegates who would serve on the committee that would handle day-to-day operations.\nThe amount of capital that each member of a cooperative organization has contributed determines the extent of their liability. Members of cooperative societies do not face any risk to their personal property due to business liabilities, unlike solo owners and partners.\nCooperatives allow members or customers to manage their supplies, eliminating middlemen\u2019s profit.\nBoth the federal government and state governments offer many forms of assistance to society. Such assistance may be given in the form of capital contributions, low-interest loans, tax exemptions, subsidies for loan repayment, etc.\nA cooperative society has a very steady existence and lasts for a very long time. Its continued existence is unaffected by the passing away, financial ruin, insanity, or resignation of any of its members.\nChallenges of Cooperative Society\n\nIndian cooperatives have been influenced by regional politicians. On the region\u2019s domestic politics, this has a big effect. Politicians profit from it, denying the poor its initial benefits.\n\nThe infrastructure and organization of cooperatives need to be regulated as well, primarily due to a shortage of funding. For these reasons, there is a need for assistance or financial support for the cooperatives.\n\nA cooperative society\u2019s ability to raise money from its members is severely constrained because membership is frequently restricted to a single sector of the community.\n\nOnce more, due to the low rate of return, the members do not increase their investment. Most cooperative societies frequently find the help of the government to be insufficient.\n\nIn general, it is observed that a lack of administrative skills is the main reason why cooperative societies do not operate effectively. The elected members or members themselves lack the necessary management skills to run the organization.\n\nEvery cooperative group is established to serve its members, not to make money. The members aren\u2019t sufficiently encouraged by this to work hard and effectively run the society.\n\n\u00a0The concept of reciprocal cooperation guides the formation of cooperative groups. However, it frequently appears that there is a great deal of conflict among the members due to ego conflicts, personality conflicts, etc. Members\u2019 often-selfish behaviour could lead to the collapse of civilization.\n\nCooperative societies are dependent on the government for assistance and patronage in the form of grants, loans, subsidies, etc. because of the lack of adequate capital and several other restrictions.\n\nWay forward\nCooperative societies should be established while taking the local environment into account. The cooperative agricultural and cooperative marketing groups should utilize neighbourhood resources to the fullest extent possible.\nThe weak and inefficient cooperative societies should either be abolished or merged with strong and efficient ones.\nThere have to be more multipurpose societies. All single-purpose civilizations ought to be transformed into pluralistic ones.\nInstitutional credit should be set aside for landless laborers, artisans, and small-scale, tenant, and sharecropper farmers as well.\nCredit providers should relax their security requirements. Through the use of a rediscounting facility, the number of loanable funds should be increased.\nThe rate of interest should be reduced so that loanable money can reach economically disadvantaged groups at the same pace that the financing banks are refinanced by the nation\u2019s central bank.\nRed tape, political meddling, administrative bottlenecks, etc. must be eliminated. The representatives shouldn\u2019t give in to political or other forms of local pressure. Strong village lobbies shouldn\u2019t unduly meddle with how cooperative societies operate. However, insofar as the greater good of the village community is concerned, they should fulfil their moral commitments with the utmost honesty.\nCo-operative society members ought to get information about Planned Parenthood, population health, and family welfare.\nIn particular, programs related to child welfare, maternal nutrition, a balanced diet, etc., should be promoted to women.\nAdult education and literacy programs should be undertaken in rural areas on a large scale.\n\nCooperatives are essential for fostering collectivism and maintaining the social capital foundation of the nation. The spirit of democracy and collectivism is best preserved through cooperatives.\n\nThe creation of a massive social network, such as cooperatives, would facilitate the creation and utilization of social capital, and the greater the social capital, the more development opportunities.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

This legislation does not apply to a sizable portion of tribals who reside outside the areas regarded as the scheduled areas.\nPanchayats have not been given enough authority to levy and collect\u00a0taxes, fees, or other levies.\nState Finance Commission decisions are only selectively\u00a0implemented, giving Panchayats no real power in practice.\nGram Sabhas are the primary tool for successfully implementing PESA by empowering the tribal people to manage their own affairs in a mostly autonomous manner. Though, in reality,\u00a0they are subordinate to other state legislatures and extraneous forces\u00a0like the forest department. It compromises PESA\u2019s primary objectives.\nGovernment Initiatives Related to Tribal Affairs\nUnion Ministry of Tribal Affairs initiated a separate scheme for promoting education among ST girls at primary levels. Under the initiative, cash incentives for sending girl children to residential schools are also provided.\nThe enactment of the Biodiversity Act protects the traditional knowledge of the tribals with regard to herbal/biological products.\nRole of NGOs and Civil Society Organisations\n\nThe organizations that work with PRIs are best suited to take on the PESA-related issue. Poor tribals must have a voice for their complaints, and they must be made aware of the rights guaranteed under the PESA Act. A requirement for the success of PESA is the strengthening of PRIs.\n\nIt is shocking that so few people know that the Gram Sabha is the governing power and that it has control over natural resources. In such situations, civil society organizations are the best place to intervene as they can organize campaigns to raise awareness about PESA Act and its importance.\n\nThe vested interests of corporate entities\u00a0represent a significant barrier to the proper implementation of PESA. Tribals are most defenseless in front of\u00a0state and money power. Civil society\u2019s careful watch can be quite important in this situation. Another action civil society can take is to draw attention to state governments\u2019 faulty laws and their interference with the implementation of the PESA.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

They may be dealt with in accordance with the authority to uphold law and order, but they cannot be imprisoned on the pretext that their actions disturbed the peace.\n\nThe case of the test of proportionality in Section 144\n\nThe Supreme Court created the proportionality test to determine whether a restriction on the liberties protected by Article 19 of the Indian Constitution is acceptable or not.\n\nTo evaluate proportionality, the Supreme Court established a four-part test in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India.\n\nA restriction on the right must have a justifiable purpose.\nIt must be an effective method for achieving this objective.\nThere must be a less stringent but equally effective substitute.\nThe action taken cannot unfairly disadvantage the rightsholder.\n\nTherefore, the legitimacy of the orders issued under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code shall be evaluated in light of these rationality and proportionality considerations.\n\nWhat are the punishments under Section 144?\n\nPeople who violate Section 144, which forbids carrying any form of weapon in the area where it has been put into effect, risk going to jail.\n\nThe maximum sentence for this type of offence is three years in prison.\n\nAccording to Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which forbids disobedience to instructions legally issued by public workers, those who disregard the prohibitory orders would face charges.\n\nWhat are the criticisms of this law?\nThe section is extensive and gives the magistrate unjustified power.\nThe initial legal defence against the order is a revision application, which must be submitted to the initial issuing authority.\nPeople who are upset claim that the state would frequently have infringed on their rights even before the High Court became involved.\nBecause the security situation varies from location to location and cannot be handled uniformly, issuing prohibitory orders over a very large area is not justified.\nConclusion\n\nUsing Section 144 can be helpful when dealing with emergencies. The executive branch is vulnerable to abuse and misuse since there is no specialized judicial monitoring and no precise tailoring of the vast executive powers with specific aims.\n\nIn order to deal with urgent crises, the legislature must strike a balance between the necessity to protect individuals\u2019 personal freedoms and other liberties under the Constitution\u2019s fundamental rights.\n\nArticle Written By: Jis John Sebastian"

For more information, keep reading.\n\nBail is an instrument for procuring the release of a person from legal custody.\n\nIt is also an undertaking that he/she shall appear at the time and place designated and submit him/herself to the jurisdiction and judgment of the court.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMaking it simple\nWhat governs bail in India?\nWhat differentiates a bailable and a non-bailable offense?\nBailable offenses\nNon-Bailable offenses\nWhat are the types of bail in India?\nRegular Bail\nInterim Bail\nAnticipatory bail\nWhat recent remarks did the Supreme Court make regarding India\u2019s bail laws?\nWhat is the UK law the Supreme Court mentioned?\nMaking it simple\n\nBail is the temporary release of a person accused of a crime in exchange for a monetary pledge in exchange for the accused\u2019s appearance in court when the time comes.\n\nThe person who pays the money or undertakes a money bond acts as the surety. He can be anyone who is financially worth the monetary conditions in the bail conditions.\n\nIn a civil case, obtaining bail is one of the defendant\u2019s rights, whereas in a criminal case, it is at the discretion of the bail granting authority ie, the competent courts, or the police officer in charge.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhat governs bail in India?\n\nThe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 governs the terms of the bail.\n\nThe phrases \u201cbailable offense\u201d and \u201cnon-bailable offense\u201d are specified in Section 2 (a) even though the Act does not define \u201cbail\u201d expressly.\n\nWhat differentiates a bailable and a non-bailable offense?\nBailable offenses\n\nThese are considered less serious, hence the punishment is less serious and the accused has a legal right to request release on bail.\n\nGenerally,\u00a0 these forms of crimes are punishable by less than three years.\n\nIn the case of bailable offenses, at the time of arrest or incarceration, the police are allowed to issue bail to the defendant.\n\nNon-Bailable offenses\n\nThe term non-bailable doesn\u2019t imply that bail can\u2019t be granted at all.\n\nSimply put, it means that the accused is not permitted to demand it as a matter of right at the time of their arrest or custody.\n\nHowever, they are permitted to approach the court while they are being prosecuted. These offenses are serious in character as opposed to offenses that are bailable.\n\nThe sentence in the case of non-bailable crimes is three years or more.\n\nThe decision to grant bail to the accused in non-bailable charges is up to the court\u2019s discretion. And the same needs to be decided carefully, not arbitrarily.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the Police officer in charge can also give bail in non-bailable offenses.\n\nAlso read: Default Bail\n\nWhat are the types of bail in India?\n\nThere exist three types of bail in India. They are\n\nRegular Bail\n\nWhen a person commits a cognizable non-bailable offense\u2014an offense so serious that a police officer can detain him without a warrant or launch an inquiry without a court\u2019s approval\u2014the police may take him into custody, and when that time is up, he must be jailed.\n\nThe accused has a right to be released from this type of confinement under Sections 437 and 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\n\nSo, a regular bail is basically the release of an accused from custody to ensure his presence at the trial.\n\nInterim Bail\n\nThis bail is provided as a temporary measure and is valid only while an application is ongoing or when the court is considering an application for anticipatory or regular bail.\n\nThe accused loses his right to be free and will be taken into custody if interim bail expires before he is given regular bail or anticipatory bail and he fails to pay the required amount to extend the bail.\n\nInterim bail is always conditional and can be prolonged.\n\nAnticipatory bail\n\nAnticipatory bail is self-defining.\n\nIt is a type of bail that is given to someone who is in anticipation of getting arrested for a non-bailable offense by the police.\n\nThis is an advanced bail mentioned under section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\n\nAn application for anticipatory bail can be heard both by the Court of Sessions and the High Courts.\n\nWhat recent remarks did the Supreme Court make regarding India\u2019s bail laws?\n\nIn its ruling in the Satender Kumar Antil v. Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case, the Supreme Court remarked that \u201cjails in India are swamped with undertrials.\n\nIt emphasized that \u201cbail is the rule and jail is an exception\u201d and urged the government to think about enacting a \u201cBail Act\u201d to make the process of granting bail more efficient.\n\nWith an \u201cabysmally low\u201d conviction rate as a backdrop, the top court also harshly criticized lower courts for how they handled bail applications.\n\nThe Supreme Court also referred to the British law on bail, while asking the Centre to formulate a \u2018Bail Act\u2019.\n\nWhat is the UK law the Supreme Court mentioned?\n\nReducing the population of prisoners is one of the main goals of the Bail Act of the United Kingdom of 1976.\n\nAssuring defendants\u2019 access to counsel is another aspect of the law.\n\nNow, let us try to answer a question related to Bail laws in India.\n\nQ.

The National and state Human rights commission is an embodiment of India\u2019s concern for the promotion and protection of human rights.\n\nNHRC\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the State human rights commission (SHRC) were established in 1993 under the Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993 which was later amended by the Protection of Human Rights (Amendment) Act, 2006.\u00a0 They are mandated to protect the rights and dignity of Indian citizens.\n\nIt is in conformity with the Paris Principles, adopted at the first international workshop on national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights held in Paris in October 1991.

They have taken several measures to promote a culture of human rights in the country. These include awareness programs by way of imparting training and bringing out publications, Seminars, and Workshops on human rights issues, reviewing various laws/ rules from a human rights perspective, and making recommendations to make them more human rights friendly.\n\nThey also assess the implementation of various programs/ schemes of Government which has a bearing upon the enforcement of human rights and make suggestions for better implementation/ enforcement.\n\nHowever, there are certain issues associated with their functioning, as we already discussed. It is in the best interest of citizens, that these issues are resolved at the earliest.

House affairs are performed under clear, well-established rules of procedure.\n\nThe speaker defends the privileges and rights of Lok Sabha members. For instance, no one can be detained inside the Lok Sabha without his/her permission.\n\nIn the absence of a quorum, the speaker has the authority to adjourn the House or postpone a session.\n\nThe Speaker sets the agenda for House meetings after consulting with the business committee and the Prime Minister. The Speaker chooses the format and style in which the House\u2019s proceedings are published.\n\nTo ask questions of the ministers, the Speaker\u2019s approval is required.\n\nThe speaker may avoid inquiries that are politically motivated or superfluous while ensuring that the important questions are discussed.\n\nThe Speaker\u2019s consent is required to introduce the bills, reports, motions, and resolutions.\n\nNo changes can be made to the Parliament House, and no new developments can be built in the Parliament Estate, without the Speaker\u2019s permission.\n\nThe Speaker also serves as the head of the Lok Sabha Secretariat and has authority over the Secretariat employees of the House.\n\nThe Speaker is the channel via which the decisions of the House are conveyed to parties and organizations outside of Parliament.\n\nThe speaker leads the inter-parliamentary group and serves as a liaison between the Indian Parliament and other parliaments around the world.\n\nHe serves as the conference\u2019s chairperson of India\u2019s legislative bodies\u2019 presiding officers.\n\nWho is the present speaker of Lok Sabha?\n\nOm Birla (since 19 June 2019).\n\nIs there a speaker post with respect to Rajya Sabha?\n\nNo. The top post in Rajya Sabha is called Chairman of Rajya Sabha.\n\nThe Vice president of India is the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.\n\nSpeaker of a State Legislative Assembly\n\nIndia is a federal country.\n\nSo, just as the post of Speaker of Lok Sabha at the union level, there is the post of Speaker of Legislative Assemblies at the state level.\n\nThere are a lot of similarities between the roles and responsibilities of the Speaker of Lok Sabha and Speaker of a Legislative Assembly.\n\nIssues with the post of Speaker of Lok Sabha\n\nThe Speaker is elected to the House on the ticket of a political party, putting his or her impartiality in jeopardy. Politically, the speaker is more likely to support his own party.\n\nRules of the Lok Sabha may be interpreted by the Speaker, which occasionally results in partisan behaviour in favour of the ruling party.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s judgment is final in regard to Money Bill declarations and cannot be challenged in court.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s decision to exclude MLAs from voting under the anti-defection law has drawn criticism in the past. It has also been contested in court.\n\nThe constitution does not provide a time restriction on how long decisions may take.\n\nThe discretionary authority to identify any law as a money bill has been abused in several situations. For instance, there was a backlash when the Aadhar bill was tabled as a Money Bill in the Lok Sabha.\n\nThe electoral system and conventions in India have not been developed to ensure the protection of the office. There may be personal reasons for Speakers to retain party membership.\n\nElections to the post of Lok Sabha speaker are not always by consensus. There have been cases when different parties have fielded their candidates.\n\nEven if the Speaker is re-elected to the House, the office of the Speaker in India is still open for elections.\n\nWay forward\n\nIt is crucial that we start comprehensively reforming the Parliamentary structure, appropriately starting with the post of Speaker, to guarantee that India improves its ranking in the Democracy Index.\n\nThe Speaker should speak for the entire House as envisaged in the Indian Constitution.\n\nThe nation is represented by House. As a result, the Speaker represents the freedom and liberty of the country. Therefore, he or she should be a person of exceptional talent and objectivity.\n\nTo ensure impartial decisions from the Lok Sabha speaker, Parliament can also explore amending the Constitution for a better mechanism.\n\nOne suggestion is to replace the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies with a \u201cpermanent tribunal led by a retired Supreme Court judge or a retired Chief Justice of a High Court.\u201d\n\nThe article written: by Chetna Yadav"

Nagaraja and Others, the Court held that animals also possess honour and dignity, and these characteristics cannot be taken away from them without justification.\n\nConstitutional protection for animal rights\n\nAccording to the \u00a0Indian Constitution, it is everyone\u2019s responsibility to care for and preserve the country\u2019s natural resources, such as its forests, lakes, rivers, and animals.\n\nHowever, many of these provisions come in the DPSPs and Fundamental Duties \u2013 which cannot be enforced unless there is statutory backing.\n\nArticle 48 A states that the State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country.\n\nArticle 51A(g) states it to be a duty of every citizen of India \u201cto protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures.\u201d\n\nFurther, the State and Concurrent List have been assigned the following items about animal rights.\n\nThe States are given the authority to \u201cpreserve, maintain and improve stock and prevent animal diseases and enforce veterinary training and practice,\u201d according to State List Item 14.\n\nThe Concurrent List contains legislation that both the Centre and the States may pass\n\n\u201cPrevention of animal cruelty,\u201d which is mentioned in item 17.\n\u201cProtection of wild animals and birds\u201d which is mentioned as item 17B.\nImportant Laws in India for the protection of animals\nIndian Penal Code (IPC)\nThe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960\nWildlife Protection Act 1972\nWhat are the sections in the Indian Penal Code devoted to Animal Protection?\n\nSection 428 \u2013 Mischief by killing or maiming animal of the value of ten rupees\u2013 whoever commits mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless any animal or animals of the value of ten rupees or upwards, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for the term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both.\n\nSection 249 \u2013 Mischief by killing or maiming cattle, etc of any value or any animal of the value of fifty rupees \u2013 whoever committing mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless any elephant, camel, horse, mule, buffalo, bull, cow or ox, whatever may be the value thereof or any other animal of the value of fifty rupees or upwards, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 5 years or with fine or with both.\n\nLegislative Interventions for the Protection of Animals: Important Laws\n\nAnimal lovers must know about the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1960), the Wildlife Protection Act (1972), and the Cosmetic Rules (2020).\n\nAlso\u00a0 Read: 100 Acts that Transformed India.\n\nThe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960\n\nThe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, was composed by under the leadership of renowned dancer and animal advocate Rukmini Devi Arundale.\n\nIt was passed by the Indian Parliament in 1960 to amend the laws about the prevention of cruelty to animals and to prevent the infliction of needless pain or suffering on animals.\n\nThe Animal Welfare Board of India was established by the Indian government by legal requirements.\n\nThe board undertakes the following functions\n\nAdvising the central government regarding amendments and rules to prevent unnecessary pain while transporting animals, performing experiments on animals, or storing animals in captivity.\nEncouragement of financial assistance, rescue homes, and animal shelters for old animals.\nAdvising the government on medical care and regulations for animal hospitals.\nImparting education and awareness on humane treatment of animals.\nAdvising the central government regarding general matters of animal welfare.\n\nAnimal slaughter in public is prohibited by the Prevention of Cruelty Act of 1960. Because of this, the Act mandates that any state in India select a slaughterhouse for any slaughter that takes place inside municipal corporation boundaries.\n\nThe number of slaughterhouses and animals sacrificed in a given area should be proportional to that area\u2019s population.\n\nChickens cannot be slaughtered anywhere other than a slaughterhouse, according to Rule 3 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, (Slaughterhouse) Rules, 2001. The killing of sick or pregnant animals is prohibited.\n\nAccording to Section 11(1)(h) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, it is considered cruelty to an animal if the owner of the animal fails to provide it with enough food, water, or shelter.\n\nAn individual who neglects an animal by depriving it of necessary food, water, shelter, and exercise or by keeping it chained or imprisoned for an excessive amount of time may be subject to a fine, up to three months in jail, or both.\n\nWildlife Protection Act, 1972\n\nHunting of certain wild species, including Indian Elephants, Indian Lions, Snow Leopards, Tigers, Great Indian Bustards, etc., is prohibited by Section 9 of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.\n\nCosmetics Rules, 2020\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare adopted the revised Cosmetics Rules, 2020 as a consequence of suggestions provided by PETA India.\n\nThe prescribed rules established a distinct and modernized regulatory framework for the development, production, distribution, and importation of cosmetic items.\n\nThe regulations also included clauses assuring that the importing of cosmetics subjected to animal testing is strictly prohibited. India became the first nation in Asia to outlaw both animal testing of cosmetics and the components used in them as well as the importing of the tested goods.\n\nAn important aspect of the established regulations is that any suffering of animals cannot be justified by the possible advantages of novel cosmetics.\n\nJudicial Interventions for the protection of animals: Important Case Laws\n\nThe are many important judgments by the Supreme Court of India in connection with the protection of animals. Some of them are:\n\n1. Animal Welfare Board of India v. Nagaraja and Others (2014)\n\nEveryone has the right to life and personal liberty, and neither may be taken away from them without a court order, as stated in Article 21. In the 2014 case of Animal Welfare Board of India v. Nagaraja and Others, the Supreme Court expressly decided on Article 21 in favour of animals.\n\nThe Apex Court ruled that every species has a legal right to life and safety under the law of the land. The meaning of the word \u201clife\u201d in Article 21 of the Constitution has been augmented, so any disruption of the basic environment, which includes all forms of life, including animal life, and which is necessary for human survival, falls within the meaning of this article.\n\nThis article also protects human rights. The term \u201clife,\u201d as used by the court, was understood as more than simply existing or surviving, as well as having inherent meaning and maintaining moral principles.\n\n2. State of Gujarat v. Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat and Ors (2005)\n\nIn State of Gujarat v. Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat and Ors (2005), the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 51A was adopted by the Parliament to be read with Articles 48 and 48A, ensuring that all provisions are interpreted by the letter of the law.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs with neglecting to report any crime against people, it is criminal to witness animal cruelty and not report it.\n\nWe ought to be kind to animals.\n\nWhile seeing animal cruelty can be painful, one must be prepared to respond in a way that will shield the animal from future harm.\n\nAnimal abuse can be diminished by notifying the proper authorities and educating kids and adults.\n\nAlso read: Ambergris: The Floating Gold; Wildlife crime\n\nArticle written by: Jis John Sebastian"

In such an eventuality, the senior most available Judge of the Supreme Court will be appointed to perform the duties of the office of the Chief Justice of India.\n\nCollegium System Of Judicial Appointments in India\nIt is the\u00a0system of appointment and transfer of judges that\u00a0has evolved through judgments of the Supreme Court, and\u00a0not by an Act of parliament\u00a0or by a provision of the Constitution.\nSC collegium is headed by the CJI (Chief Justice of India) and comprises four other senior-most judges\u00a0of the Supreme Court.\nThe present form of the collegium system has evolved by the supreme court through three different judgments popularly known as the \u2018three judges case\u2019.\n1. P Gupta vs President of India and others (1981) [1st judges case]\nIt declared that the \u201cprimacy\u201d of the CJI\u2019s (chief justice of India) recommendation on judicial appointments and transfers can be refused for \u201ccogent reasons.\u201d\nThe ruling gave the Executive primacy over the Judiciary in judicial appointments in India for the next 12 years.\n2. Advocate on record association vs Union of India (1993) [2nd judges case]\nSC introduced the Collegium system, holding that \u201cconsultation\u201d really meant \u201cconcurrence\u201d.\nIt added that it was not the CJI\u2019s individual opinion, but an institutional opinion formed in consultation with the two senior-most judges in the SC\n3. Special reference case (1998) [3rd judges case]\n\nSC on the President\u2019s reference (Article 143) expanded the Collegium to a five-member body, comprising the CJI and four of his senior-most colleagues.\n\nCriticism Against Collegium System\nNon-transparency and opaque-No official procedure for selection\nPromotes\u00a0nepotism\nInefficient: Collegium has not been able to prevent the increasing cases of vacancies of judges and pending cases in courts.\nCollegium\u2019 is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution and has been evolved by the judiciary itself for retaining the power to select judges by itself\nAttempts To Reform Judicial Appointments: NJAC\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nThe National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) was a constitutional body proposed to replace the present Collegium system of appointing judges.\n\nIt\u00a0was established by amending the Constitution [Constitution (Ninety-Ninth Amendment) Act, 2014]\n\nNJAC was envisioned as consisting of six people:\n\nChief Justice of India\nTwo most senior judges of the Supreme Court\nLaw Minister\nTwo \u2018eminent persons\u2019. These eminent persons are to be nominated for a three-year term by a committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the Prime Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and are not eligible for re-nomination.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court rejected the National Judicial Appointments Commission(NJAC) Act and the 99th Constitutional Amendment in the Fourth judges\u2019 case (2015).\n\nConsequently, the earlier collegium system became operative again.\n\nWho appoints judges of High Courts in India?\n\nEvery high court consists of a chief justice and such other judges as the president may from time to time deem necessary to appoint.\n\nAppointment of Chief Justice Of High Court\nIn case of the initial appointment of a Chief Justice of a High Court, the provisions of Article 217 will have to be followed.\nInitiation of the proposal for the appointment of Chief Justice of a High Court would be by the Chief Justice of India\nThe provision of Article 222 will govern the transfer of Chief Justice from one High Court to another\nAfter receipt of the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India, the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs would obtain the views of the concerned State Government. After receipt of the views of the State Government, the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs, will submit proposals to the Prime Minister, who will then advise the President as to the selection.\nAs soon as the appointment is approved by the President, the Department of Justice will announce the appointment and issue the necessary notification in the Gazette of India.\nAppointment Of Acting Chief Justice of High Court\nAppointment of Acting Chief Justices is to be made by the President under Article 223 of the Constitution\nAppointment of Permanent Judges Of High Court\n\nFor appointments in these High Courts, the Chief Justice would initiate a proposal to the Governor of the State where the seat of High Court is situated\u00a0 In case, any of the State authorities wish to recommend a name different from the one recommended by the Chief Justice of the High Court, he should send the same to the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned for his consideration. The initiation of a recommendation for filling up of a vacancy would be made only by the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned\n\nArticle written by: Vivek Rajasekharan"

Other objectives can be listed as follows:\n\nSpreading Legal Awareness\nOrganizing Lok Adalats\nPromoting dispute settlements\nProviding the victims of crime with compensation\nLegal Services Authority Act\n\nSection 12 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 prescribes the criteria for giving legal services to eligible persons.\n\nEvery person who has to file or defend a case shall be entitled to legal services under\u00a0this Act if that person is-\n\na member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe;\na victim of trafficking in human beings or begar as referred to in Article 23 of the Constitution;\na woman or a child;\na mentally ill or otherwise disabled person;\na person under circumstances of undeserved want such as being a victim of a mass disaster, ethnic violence, caste atrocity, flood, drought, earthquake, or industrial disaster; or\nan industrial workman; or\nin custody, including custody in a protective home according to the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 (104 of 1956);\nor in a juvenile home according to the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 (53 of 1986) or in a psychiatric hospital or psychiatric nursing according to the Mental Health Act, 1987 (14 of 1987); or\nin receipt of annual income less than rupees nine thousand or such other higher amount as may be prescribed by the State Govt., if the case is before a court other than the Supreme Court, and less than rupees twelve thousand or such other higher amount as may be prescribed by the Central Govt., if the case is before the Supreme Court.\u201d (Rules have been amended to enhance the income ceiling).\n\nNational Legal Services Authority is the apex body constituted to lay down policies and principles for making legal services available under the provisions of the Act and to frame the most effective and economical schemes for legal services.\n\nIt also disburses funds and grants to State Legal Services Authorities and NGOs for implementing legal aid schemes and programs.\n\nChallenges faced by National Legal Services Authority (NALSA)\nThe number of actual beneficiaries of the legal aid services is less according to the India Justice Report of 2019.\nThe legal aides are not well trained enough to handle free legal services and people associated with it.\nThere is a lack of optimal financial management, inadequate performance monitoring, and no mechanism to record customer satisfaction.\nThe organizational practices are very uneven which is hampering the legal services on the national scale as a collective.\nGender parity is missing among the representatives, which hinders the aiding of the women victims.\nWay forward\n\nLegal aid is a human right, and article 21 of the Indian constitution describes it as a right to free legal aid or free legal service as a fundamental right. Legal aid as a human right is also envisaged in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948.\n\nHence, it is the judicial system\u2019s responsibility that a mechanism like NALSA is utilized to the fullest to aid the right section of the society. More mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that the needed can avail of the services without any hindrance.\n\nInitiatives like the Legal service mobile app launched by NALSA to enable equitable access to justice are a step in the right direction.\n\nDISHA scheme was launched by the Department of Justice:\n\nDesigning Innovative Solutions for Holistic Access to Justice (DISHA) is a comprehensive, holistic, integrated, and systemic solution to access justice at the pan-India level.\nAll the Access to Justice Programmes have been merged under the DISHA scheme and upscaled to all India levels.\n\nOther components of DISHA are:\n\nTele-Law: Reaching the Unreached;\nEnsure pan \u2013 India dispensation framework to deliver Pro Bono legal Services through Nyaya Bandhu (Pro Bono Legal Services) program;\nFacilitate disposal of 15-year-old pending cases at the district level through its Nyaya Mitra program and empower citizens through Pan India legal literacy and legal awareness program.\n\nThe Scheme embeds the use of technology and developing contextualized IEC (Information, Education, and Communication) material in regional/local dialects to support its intervention and to achieve easy accessibility of legal services to the poor and weakest sections of society.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nWith reference to National Legal Services Authority, consider the following statements: (2013)\n\nIts objective is to provide free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of society based on equal opportunity.\nIt issues guidelines for the State Legal Services Authorities to implement the legal programmes and schemes throughout the country.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n\n(a)\u00a01 only\n(b)\u00a02 only\n(c)\u00a0Both 1 and 2\n(d)\u00a0Neither 1 nor 2\n\nAns: (c)"

Generally speaking, a patent provides the patent owner with the right to decide how \u2013 or whether \u2013 the invention can be used by others.\nIn exchange for this right, the patent owner makes technical information about the invention publicly available in the published patent document.\n\nThe following cannot be patented:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFrivolous Invention: Invention that harms public order/Morality/ health of animals, plants & humans\nMethods of agriculture or horticulture\nTraditional Knowledge\nComputer Program\nInventions related to Atomic Energy\nPlants & Animals\nMere discovery of the scientific principle\n\nAlso read: Evergreening of Patents\n\nTrademark\nA trademark is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from those of other enterprises.\nTrademarks date back to ancient times when artisans used to put their signature or \u201cmark\u201d on their products.\nIndustrial property\n\nAn industrial design constitutes the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article.\n\nA design may consist of three-dimensional features, such as the shape or surface of an article, or two-dimensional features, such as patterns, lines, or color. Industrial property can usefully be divided into two main areas:\nOne area can be characterized as the protection of distinctive signs, in particular trademarks (which distinguish the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings) and geographical indications (which identify a good as originating in a place where a given characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin).\nThe protection of such distinctive signs aims to stimulate and ensure fair competition and to protect consumers, by enabling them to make informed choices between various goods and services. The protection may last indefinitely, provided they sign in question continues to be distinctive\nOther types of industrial property are protected primarily to stimulate innovation, design, and the creation of technology. In this category fall invention (protected by patents), industrial designs, and trade secrets.\nThe social purpose is to protect the results of investment in the development of new technology, thus giving the incentive and means to finance research and development activities.\nA functioning intellectual property regime should also facilitate the transfer of technology in the form of foreign direct investment, joint ventures, and licensing.\nThe protection is usually given for a finite term (typically 20 years in the case of patents).\nGeographical indications\nGeographical indications and appellations of origin are signs used on goods that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities, a reputation, or characteristics that are essentially attributable to that place of origin.\nMost commonly, a geographical indication includes the name of the place of origin of the goods.\nTrade secrets\nTrade secrets are IP rights on confidential information that may be sold or licensed.\nThe unauthorized acquisition, use, or disclosure of such secret information in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices by others is regarded as an unfair practice and a violation of the trade secret protection.\nWorld Intellectual Property Day\n\nOn April 26 every year we celebrate World Intellectual Property Day to promote discussion of the role of IP in encouraging innovation and creativity.\n\nWorld Intellectual Property Day 2022\u2019s theme focuses on IP and Youth innovating for a Better Future. It explores how these innovative, energetic, and creative minds are driving positive change.\nIndia and Intellectual Property Rights\n\nActs Dealing with Intellectual Property Rights in India:\n\nThe Copyright Act, 1957\nThe Patents Act, 1970\nThe Trade Marks Act, 1999\nThe Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999\n\nIndia adopted the National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy as a vision document to guide the future development of IPRs in the country.\n\nThe Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP) under the Ministry of Commerce has been appointed as the nodal department to coordinate, guide, and oversee the implementation and future development of IPRs in India.\nThe \u2018Cell for IPR Promotion & Management (CIPAM)\u2019, set up under DIPP, is to be the single point of reference for the implementation of the objectives of the National IPR Policy.\n\nThe campaign \u2018KAPILA\u2019, which stands for Kalam Program for Intellectual Property Literacy and Awareness campaign, was launched on 15th October 2020. The day was launched in honor of the 89th birth anniversary of former President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.\n\nIndia is a member of the World Trade Organization\u2019s\u00a0Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) Agreement.\n\nIndia is also a member of the following important\u00a0WIPO-administered International Treaties and Conventions relating to IPRs.\n\nBudapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for Patent Procedure\nParis Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property\nConvention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization\nBerne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\nPatent Cooperation Treaty\nProtocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks- Madrid Protocol\nWashington Treaty on Intellectual Property in respect of Integrated Circuits\nNairobi Treaty on the Protection of the Olympic Symbol\nConvention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms\nMarrakesh Treaty to facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities.\n\nRead: Patent Amendment Rules 2024\n\nDrawbacks of the Indian IPR system\n\nEvergreening of Patents:\n\nSection 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act 1970 (as amended in 2005) does not allow patents to be granted to inventions involving new forms of a known substance unless it differs significantly in properties about efficacy.\nThis means that the Indian Patent Act does not allow the evergreening of patents. The pharma companies have been facing problems due to this.\n\nCompulsory licensing:\n\nCompulsory licensing is problematic for foreign investors who bring technology as they are concerned about the misuse of CL to replicate their products. It has been impacting India-EU FTA negotiations.\nIt is the grant of permission by the government to entities to use, manufacture, import, or sell a patented invention without the patent owner\u2019s consent. Patents Act in India deals with CL.\nIt is\u00a0permitted under the WTO\u2019s TRIPS (IPR) Agreement\u00a0provided conditions such as \u2018national emergencies, other circumstances of extreme urgency and anti-competitive practices\u2019 are fulfilled.\n\nData exclusivity:\n\nForeign investors complain that the Indian law does not contain the unfair commercial use of test data submitted to the government during the application for market approval.\nA data exclusivity law is being demanded from the Indian side.\nAdvantages And Disadvantages of Intellectual Property Rights\n\nAdvantages of IPR:\n\nSafeguards creators rights\nPromotes innovation and creativity\nFacilitates ease of doing business\nEnhances economic value\nExpands the export regime\n\nDisadvantages of IPR\n\nExpensive for the first IPR filing for any process of the product.\nPirating has still not stopped after IPR protection.\nQuality is compromised with the aging of IPR.\nIPR was considered a hindrance during the COVID-19 vaccine distribution system initially as IPR restrictions made low and middle-income countries unable to manufacture vaccines domestically.\nWay forward\n\nIntellectual Property rights are a very important aspect of any kind of research and development and creativity hence the future generation should be made aware of them from the school level itself.\n\nThe current issues with IPR regulations should be addressed so that India can take full advantage of the benefits of a strong IP system on a global scale.\n\nIPR safeguards will help boost India\u2019s Make in India and Atmanirbhar campaigns."

It makes it the legal duty of a person aware of the offence to report the sexual abuse. In case he fails to do so, the person can be punished with six months imprisonment or a fine.\nIt also prescribes punishment to the people who traffic children for sexual purposes.\nThe Act also provides for punishment against false complaints or untrue information.\nThe act was amended in 2019 to increase the minimum punishment from seven years to ten years. It further adds that if a person commits penetrative sexual assault on a child below the age of 16 years, he will be punishable with imprisonment between 20 years to life, with a fine.\nAggravated penetrative sexual assault under POCSO Act, 2012 is the equivalent provision for aggravated rape.\nA person can be charged with this offence in certain aggravating circumstances, such as if the rape occurs within a relationship of trust or authority, or if it leads to pregnancy, among others.\nUnder POCSO, the consent of a person under the age of 18 is irrelevant, regardless of the nature and circumstance of the sexual interaction, or the particulars of the person with whom it takes place. This means that\u00a0any sex with a minor is rape.\nKey features of the Act\n\nIt is a gender-neutral act\n\nBy defining a child as \u2018any person below the age of 18 years, the POCSO Act sets a gender-neutral tone for the legal framework available to child sexual abuse victims. The act also does not distinguish between perpetrators of child sexual abuse on the grounds of gender.\n\nIt is an offence to not report an abuse\n\nIt requires every person who suspects or has knowledge of a sexual offence being committed against a child to report it to the local police or the Special Juvenile Police Unit. The act not only punishes the perpetrator of sexual abuse but also penalizes those who have failed to report the offence with either imprisonment, a fine, or both.\n\nNo time limit for reporting abuse\n\nA victim can report an offence at any time, even several years after the abuse has been committed. Therefore, organizations dealing with children in India cannot deny child sexual abuse complaints filed against their employees on the pretext of lapse of time.\n\nConfidentiality of victim\u2019s identity\n\nSection 23 of the POCSO Act prohibits disclosure of the victim\u2019s identity in any form of media, except when permitted by the special courts established under the act. A violation of this section can attract punishments under the act.\n\nNew rules added to the act\n\nAny institution housing children, or coming in regular contact with them, is required to conduct a periodic police verification and background check of every employee who might interact with a child.\nSuch an institution must impart regular training to sensitize its employees on child safety and protection.\nIt has to adopt a child protection policy based on the principle of zero tolerance to violence against children. This policy must mirror the child protection policy of the state government in which the organization operates.\nGeneral principles of the POCSO Act\n\nThe Act mentions 12 key principles which are to be followed by anyone, including the State Governments, the Child Welfare Committee, the Police, the Special Courts, NGOs, or any other professional present during the trial and assisting the child during the trial, which are-\n\nRight to life and survival: A child must be shielded from any kind of physical, psychological, mental, and emotional abuse and neglect\n\nBest interests of the child: The primary consideration must be the harmonious development of the child\n\nRight to be treated with dignity and compassion: Child victims should be treated in a caring and sensitive manner throughout the justice process\n\nRight to be protected from discrimination: The justice process must be transparent and just; irrespective of the child\u2019s cultural, religious, linguistic, or social orientation\n\nRight to special preventive measures: It suggests, that victimized children are more likely to get abused again, thus, preventive measures and training must be given to them for self-protection\n\nRight to be informed: The child victim or witness must be well informed of the legal proceedings\n\nRight to be heard and to express views and concerns: Every child has the right to be heard in respect of matters affecting him/her\n\nRight to effective assistance: financial, legal, counselling, health, social and educational services, physical and psychological recovery services, and other services necessary for the child\u2019s healing must be provided\n\nRight to Privacy: The child\u2019s privacy and identity must be protected at all stages of the pre-trial and trial process\n\nRight to be protected from hardship during the justice process: Secondary victimization or hardships for a child during the justice procedure must be minimized\n\nRight to safety: A child victim must be protected before, during, and after the justice process\n\nRight to compensation: The child victim may be awarded compensation for his/her relief and rehabilitation\n\nGlobal laws to protect children from sexual harassment\n\nThe United Nations\u00a0Convention on the Rights of the Child\u00a0(CRC) is an international\u00a0treaty\u00a0that legally obligates nations to protect children\u2019s rights.\n\nArticles 34 and 35 of the CRC require states to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. This includes outlawing the coercion of a child to perform sexual acts, the prostitution of children, and the exploitation of children in creating pornography. States are also required to prevent the abduction, sale, or trafficking of children.\n\nBooks for extra reference\nImportant Acts that Transformed India\nImportant Judgments that Transformed India\n\nRelated articles:\n\nChild trafficking in India\nChild marriages in India\nChildren in Armed Conflict\nChild Sexual Abuse in India"

With an intent to seek revenge from Bhanwari, five men attacked Bhanwari\u2019s husband and brutally raped her. However, due to the great political/social influence of the family of the accused, the rape survivor did not get justice from the courts and the rapists were allowed to go free.\n\nSupporting the cause of working women in India, lawyers and women\u2019s rights activists filed public interest litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court under the banner of Vishaka. The Supreme Court, considering such grave concern, acknowledged the serious legislative shortcoming and acknowledged workplace sexual harassment as a human rights violation under the Constitution of India.\n\n\u201cVishaka Guidelines\u201d were stipulated by the Supreme Court of India, in Vishaka and others v State of Rajasthan case in 1997, regarding\u00a0sexual harassment at the workplace. The court stated that these guidelines were to be implemented until legislation is passed to deal with the issue.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court judgment in the case of Vishaka & vs State of Rajasthan (1997), the Ministry of Women and Child Development, after several years, passed the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (PoSH Act).\n\nSimultaneously, the Ministry also formulated the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Rules, 2013 (PoSH Rules) effective from the same date to strengthen and streamline the provisions under the PoSH Act.\n\nProvisions of the PoSH Act\nThe Act defines sexual harassment at the workplace and creates a mechanism for redressal of complaints and safeguards against false or malicious charges.\nEvery employer is required to constitute an Internal Complaints Committee(ICC) at each office or branch with 10 or more employees.\nThe Complaints Committees have the powers of civil courts and are required to provide for conciliation before initiating an inquiry if requested by the complainant.\nPenalties have been prescribed for employers for non-compliance with the provisions of the Act.\nThe State Government will notify the District Officer in every district, who will constitute a Local Complaints Committee (LCC) to enable women in the unorganized sector or small establishments to work in an environment free of sexual harassment\n\nConstituting an ICC sends a powerful message that the company is completely committed to working towards women\u2019s safety. Nonetheless, it is important to note that constituting an ICC is a mandatory requirement under the PoSH Act and not abiding by the same can attract heavy fines including cancellation of license to conduct business operations.\n\nSHe-Box\nThe Ministry of Women & Child Development had launched Sexual Harassment electronic Box (SHe-Box) to provide single window access to every woman, irrespective of her work status, whether working in the organized or unorganized, private or public sector, to facilitate the registration of complaint related to sexual harassment.\nAny woman facing sexual harassment at the workplace can register their complaint through this portal.\nOnce a complaint is submitted to the \u2018SHe-Box\u2019, it will be directly sent to the concerned authority having jurisdiction to take action into the matter.\nJ.S Verma Committee on sexual harassment at workplace, 2012\n\nThe Justice JS Verma committee was set up after the Nirbhaya incident of December 2012 and submitted its recommendations on strengthening the laws to curb crimes against women.\n\nRecommendations of the panel were:\n\nThe Committee had recommended setting up of an employment tribunal instead of an internal complaints committee (ICC) in the Sexual Harassment at the Workplace Act.\nThe committee proposed that the tribunal should not function as a civil court but may choose its procedure to deal with each complaint to ensure faster disposal of cases.\nInternal complaints could be more counterproductive as dealing with such complaints in-house could discourage women from filing complaints.\nDomestic workers should be included within the purview of the Act.\nThe Committee has termed the Sexual Harassment Act unsatisfactory and not reflecting the spirit of the Vishakha guidelines framed by the Supreme Court in 1997 to curb sexual harassment at the workplace.\nThe Committee said any unwelcome behaviour should be seen from the subjective perception of the complainant, thus broadening the scope of the definition of sexual harassment.\nThe panel said an employer should be held liable if\nhe or she facilitated sexual harassment\npermitted an environment where sexual misconduct becomes widespread and systematic\nWhere the employer fails to disclose the company\u2019s policy on sexual harassment and ways in which workers can file a complaint\nWhen the employer fails to forward a complaint to the tribunal\nThe company would also be liable to pay compensation to the complainant\nThe panel opposed penalizing women for false complaints as it can potentially nullify the objective of the law.\nThe panel also said that the time limit of three months to file a complaint should be done away with and a complainant should not be transferred without her consent.\nAre there any mandates at the international level against sexual harassment?\n\nYes. The UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women also includes prevention from sexual harassment at the workplace.\n\nUN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)\n\nThe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), was implemented in the year 1979 by the UN General Assembly which is often described as an international bill of rights for women. It enumerates what constitutes discrimination against women and also sets up a goal for national action to end such discrimination.\n\nThe Convention describes discrimination against women as \u2013 \u201cany distinction, exclusion or restriction made based on sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.\u201d\n\nThe Convention provides the basis for achieving equality between women and men through ensuring women\u2019s equal access to, and equal opportunities in, political and public life including the right to vote and to stand for election as well as health, education, and employment.\n\nThe parties to this Convention agree to take all suitable measures, including legislation and temporary measures so that women can enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe Convention is the only human rights treaty that affirms the reproductive rights of women and targets culture and tradition as influential forces shaping gender roles and family relations. It affirms women\u2019s rights to acquire change or retain their nationality and the nationality of their children.\n\nThe Countries that have acceded to the Convention are legally bound to set its provisions into practice.\n\nWay forward\n\nSexual harassment at the workplace is a very sensitive issue and is required to be handled with the utmost care, patience, and understanding thus, the complaints must be redressed as quickly as possible to ensure a harmonious and harassment-free workplace for all employees.\n\nHence, it is high time the Justice Verma panel recommendations are incorporated and the act is renewed.\n\nBooks for extra reference\nImportant Acts that Transformed India\nImportant Judgments that Transformed India"

Eg: National Investigation Agency (NIA), National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Lokpal and Lokayukta, etc.\nNon-Statutory Bodies \u2013 They usually get the power from an Executive order. Eg: NITI Aayog, National Development Council (NDC) etc\n\nStatutory Bodies can be further classified into two based on their roles and responsibilities. They are (1) Regulatory Bodies and (2) Quasi-Judicial Bodies.\n\nRegulatory Bodies \u2013 A regulatory body is a government agency that is accountable for exercising autonomous authority over some area of human activity in a regulatory or supervisory capacity. However, their regulatory interventions are outside executive observation. Eg: the Biodiversity Authority of India (BAI), Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), etc.\nQuasi-Judicial Bodies \u2013 Quasi-Judicial bodies are non-judicial bodies like Commissions or Tribunals which can interpret the law.\u00a0They are different from judicial bodies in that their field is limited compared to a court. Eg: National Green Tribunal,\u00a0National Human Rights Commission, Central Information Commission.\n\nNote: One statutory body can be both regulatory as well as quasi-judicial in nature.
