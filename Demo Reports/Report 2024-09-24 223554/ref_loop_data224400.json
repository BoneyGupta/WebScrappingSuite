This long period covers 99% of human history.\nMesolithic: environmental changes; 12,000 years ago till about 10,000 years ago; stone tools are generally tiny, and are called microliths.

For example, in Mohenjodaro, a tank: Great Bath.\nKalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed.\nMohenjodaro, Harappa and Lothal had elaborate store houses.\nHouses were either one or two storeys high, with rooms built around a courtyard.\nMost houses had a separate bathing area, and some had wells to supply water.\nMany of these cities had covered drains.\nAll three \u2014 houses, drains and streets \u2014 were probably planned and built at the same time.\nMost of the things are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver.\nCopper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels.\nGold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels.\nHarappans also made seals out of stone which are rectangular and had an animal carved on them.\nMade pots with beautiful black designs.\nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago.\nPerhaps some women and men may have been specialists to perform crafts.\nThe Harappans probably got copper from present-day Rajasthan, and even from Oman.\nTin may have bought from present-day Afghanistan and Iran.\nGold could have come all the way from present-day Karnataka.\nA new tool, the plough, was used to dig the earth for turning the soil and planting seeds but wooden plough not found while excavation.\nAs this region does not receive heavy rainfall, some form of irrigation may have been used.\nDholavira was located on Khadir Beyt in the Rann of Kutch, where there was fresh water and fertile soil.\nDholavira was divided into three parts but other Harappan cities 2 parts.\nLarge letters of the Harappan script that were carved out of white stone and perhaps inlaid in wood. Normally seals found on small objects so the above discovery was an unique one.\nLothal stood beside a tributary of the Sabarmati.\nHere raw materials such as semi-precious stones were easily available.\nA dockyard at Lothal, where boats and ships came in from the sea and through the river channel.\nEarly Republic\nJanapadas\nThe rajas who perform big ritual sacrifices.\nThe word janapada literally means the land where the jana[people] set its foot, and settled down.\nExcavations of janapadas, settlements, were found at Purana Qila in Delhi, Hastinapur near Meerut, and Atranjikhera, near Etah (the last two are in Uttar Pradesh).\nThe people lived in huts, and kept cattle as well as other animals.\nThey also grew a variety of crops \u2014 rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard.\nSpecial type of pottery found at these sites is known as Painted Grey Ware of simple lines and geometric patterns.\nMahajanapadas\n2500 years ago, some janapadas became more important than others: mahajanapadas.\nMost had a capital city, many of these were fortified\nThe new rajas now began maintaining armies.\nSoldiers were paid regular salaries.\nChanges in agriculture around this time were seen.\nOne was growing use of iron ploughshares. Here more grain could be produced than with wooden plough.\nSecond, people began transplanting paddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed on the ground, saplings were grown and then planted in the fields.\nMagadha\nRivers such as Ganga, Son made the transport easier. Water supplies for both drinking and agriculture.\nThere were iron ore mines in the region which was able to make strong tools and weapon.\nBimbisara and Ajatasatru, the two powerful rulers who used all means to conquer other janapadas.\nMahapadma Nanda, extended his control up to the north-west part of subcontinent.\nMagadha\u2019s capital was shifted from Rajagriha (present Rajgir) to Pataliputra (present Patna)\nAlexander of Macedonia reached upto the banks of river Beas in light of conquering Magadha, but his soldiers refused due to fear of Magadha\u2019s elephant and chariot armies.\nVajji\nIt was having distinct govt from Mahajanapadas.\nGovt was known as gana or sangha.\nVaishali(Bihar) was its capital.\nThis institution had many rulers (1000s)not one.\nThey were called Raja.\u00a0These rajas performed rituals together. They also met in assemblies for future course of action if needed.\nWomen, dasas and kammakaras [landless agri labourers] could not participate in these assemblies.\nBoth the Buddha and Mahavira belonged to ganas.\nThese institution lasted for 1500 years, powerful Rajas tried to conquer sanghas.\nBut the Gupta era started when last Sangha ruler was defeated.\n\nCompiled by\u00a0Vibin Lakshmanan"

They want to know true meaning of life\nBuddha\n\nBuddha belonged to a small gana known as the Sakya gana and was a Kshatriya.\nHe finally decided to find his path to realisation and meditated for days under a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he attained enlightenment. After that, he was known as the Buddha or the Wise One.\nSarnath, near Varanasi, where he taught for the first time.\nHe passed away at Kusinara.\nThe Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires.\nThe Buddha described this as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything.\nHe also taught people to be kind and to respect the lives of others, including animals.\nHe believed that the results of our actions (called karma), whether good or bad, affect us both in this life and the next.\nTaught in the language of the ordinary people, Prakrit.\nHe also encouraged people to think for themselves.\nAfter the death of Buddha, different Buddhist Councils were conveyed to discuss Buddhist doctrines.\nUpanishads\nSame time or perhaps earlier than Buddha, other thinkers also tried to find answers to difficult questions like \u201clife after death\u201d, performing \u201critual sacrifices \u201d etc.\nThere was something permanent that lasted even after death. They named it atman or the individual soul and the brahman or universal soul.\nThey believed that ultimately, both the atman and the Brahman were one.\nMany of their ideas were recorded in the Upanishads. These were part of the later Vedic texts.\nRecorded texts contain conversations between teachers and students, through simple dialogues.\nJainism\nThe most famous thinker of the Jainas, Vardhamana Mahavira was a contemporary of Buddha.\nHe was a Kshatriya prince of the Lichchhavis, a group that was part of the Vajji sangha.\nHe taught a simple doctrine: men and women who wished to know the truth must leave their homes.\nThey must follow very strictly the rules of ahimsa, which means not hurting or killing living beings.\nIt was very difficult for most men and women to follow these strict rules like remaining nude or maintaining celibacy eg: farmers find it difficult to follow because they can\u2019t weed out insects.\nOrdinary people could understand the teachings because in the Prakrit language.\nJainism was supported mainly by traders.\nThe sangha\nBoth the Mahavira and the Buddha felt that only those who left their homes could gain true knowledge. They arranged for them to stay together in the sangha, an association of those who left their homes.\nThe rules made for the Buddhist sangha were written down in a book called the Vinaya Pitaka.\nMen and women who joined the sangha led simple lives.\nThose who joined the sangha included brahmins, Kshatriyas, merchants, labourers, barbers, courtesans, children and slaves.\nMonasteries\nThe only time both Buddhists and Jainists stayed in one place was during the rainy season when it was very difficult to travel.\nThese shelters were called viharas.\nThe earliest viharas were made of wood, and then of brick. Some were even in caves that were dug out in hills, especially in western India.\nSystem of ashramas\nSame time as Buddha and Jain, brahmins developed these ashramas.\nIt is used as for a stage of life instead of people living and meditating.\nFour ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa.\nGenerally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands.\n\nCompiled by\u00a0Vibin Lakshmanan"

Many of Chanakya\u2019s ideas were written down in a book titled Arthashastra.\nMegasthenes was an ambassador who was sent to the court of Chandragupta by the Greek ruler of West Asia named Seleucus Nicator.\nAshoka was one of the greatest rulers known to history and on his instructions inscriptions were carved on pillars, as well as on rock surfaces.\nMost of Ashoka\u2019s inscriptions were in Prakrit and were written in the Brahmi script.\nPeople in different parts of the empire spoke different languages.\n\nRuling the empire\n\nAs the empire was so large, different parts were ruled differently.\nThe area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes.\nSpies were kept a watch on the officials.\nOther areas or provinces were ruled by a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain.\nHere Royal Princes were often sent as governors, and local customs and rules were followed.\nAshoka\u2019s dhamma\n\nAfter Kalinga[current coastal Odisha] he gave up war.\nHe started to execute Dhamma[prakrit term for Dharma]\nAshoka\u2019s dhamma did not involve the worship of a god or the performance of a sacrifice. He felt it his duty to instruct his subjects through the teachings of Budhha.\nHe appointed officials, known as the dhamma mahamatta who went from place to place teaching people about dhamma.\nBesides, Ashoka got his messages inscribed on rocks and pillars, instructing his officials to read his message to those who could not read it themselves.\nAlso sent messengers to spread ideas about dhamma to other lands, such as Syria, Egypt, Greece, and Sri Lanka.\n\nRead: Edicts of Ashoka\n\nGreat Wall of China\nSomewhat before the time of the Mauryan empire, about 2400 years ago, began to build this wall.\nIt was meant to protect the northern frontier of the empire from pastoral people.\nAdditions to the wall were made over a period of 2,000 years because the frontiers of the empire kept shifting.\nVital Villages, Thriving Towns\nThe use of iron began in the subcontinent around 3,000 years ago.\nThe kings and kingdoms could not have existed without the support of flourishing villages.\nSome of the earliest works in Tamil, known as Sangam literature, were composed around 2300 years ago. These texts were called Sangam because they were supposed to have been composed and compiled in assemblies (known as sangams) of poets that were held in the city of Madurai.\nJataka were stories that were probably composed by ordinary people, and then written down and preserved by Buddhist monks.\nWe have hardly any remains of palaces, markets, or homes of ordinary people. Perhaps some are yet to be discovered by archaeologists.\nAnother way of finding out about early cities is from the accounts of sailors and travelers who visited them.\nCrafts include extremely fine pottery, known as the Northern Black Polished Ware. It is generally found in the northern part of the subcontinent, so the name. It is usually black in color and has a fine sheen.\nMany crafts persons and merchants now formed associations known as shrenis.\nThese shrenis of crafts persons provided training, procuring raw materials, and distributed the finished product.\nShrenis also served as a bank.\nTraders, Kings, and Pilgrims\nSangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas. They became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago.\nEach of the three chiefs had two centers of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas.\nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people.\nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India.\nThe most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni.\nHe and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south.\nSilk Route & Kushans\nSome people from China who went to distant lands on foot, on horseback, and on camels, carried silk with them. The paths they followed came to be known as the Silk Route.\nSome kings tried to control large portions of the route. This was because they could benefit from taxes, tributes, and gifts that were brought by traders traveling along the route. In return, they often protected the traders who passed through their kingdoms from attacks by robbers.\nThe best-known of the rulers who controlled the Silk Route were the Kushanas, who ruled over central Asia and northwest India around 2000 years ago.\nTheir two major centers of power were Peshawar and Mathura. Taxila was also included in their kingdom.\nDuring their rule, a branch of the Silk Route extended from Central Asia down to the seaports at the mouth of the river Indus, from where silk was shipped westwards to the Roman Empire.\nThe Kushanas issued gold coins. These were used by traders along the Silk Route.\nSpread of Buddhism\nThe most famous Kushana ruler was Kanishka, who ruled around 1900 years ago.\nHe organized a Buddhist council, where scholars met and discussed important matters.\nAshvaghosha, a poet who composed a biography of the Buddha, the Buddhacharita, lived in his court. He and other Buddhist scholars began writing in Sanskrit.\nA new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana Buddhism, now developed.\nHere it has 2 distinct features: (1) Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs. Now statues are made. From Mathura and Taxila. (2) regarded with belief in Bodhisattvas. Earlier once they attained Enlightenment they could live in complete isolation and meditate in peace. Now they remained in the world to teach and help other people. This type of worship prevailed throughout Central Asia, China, and later in Korea and Japan.\nTraders probably halted in cave monasteries during their travels.\nThe older form of Buddhism, known as Theravada Buddhism was more popular in areas like\u00a0 Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia.\nThe famous Chinese Buddhist pilgrims were Fa Xian, who came to the subcontinent about 1600 years ago, Xuan Zang came around 1400 years ago and I-Qing, who came about 50 years after Xuan Zang.\nBhakti\nThe worship of certain deities, which became a central feature of later Hinduism, gained in importance were the contemporaries of other religion\nAnybody, whether rich or poor, belonging to the so-called \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 castes, man or woman, could follow the path of Bhakti.\nThe idea of Bhakti is present in the Bhagavad Gita.\nThose who followed the system of Bhakti emphasized devotion and individual worship of a god or goddess, rather than the performance of elaborate sacrifices\nOnce this idea gained acceptance, artists made beautiful images of these deities.\n\nAlso read: Anglo-Afghan Wars (1839-1919)\n\nPost-Maurya Rulers\n\nAfter the decline of the Maurya Empire, several regional and dynastic powers emerged in different parts of ancient India. These post-Maurya rulers played significant roles in shaping the political landscape and cultural developments of their respective regions.\n\nShunga Dynasty (185-73 BCE):\n\nThe Shunga dynasty emerged in the Magadha region after the fall of the Mauryas.\nPushyamitra Shunga is considered the founder of the dynasty. He was a general in the Mauryan army who assassinated the last Maurya ruler.\nThe Shungas ruled from their capital at Pataliputra (modern-day Patna) and are known for their patronage of Buddhism and arts.\n\nKanvas (73-30 BCE):\n\nThe Kanvas succeeded the Shungas and ruled the Magadha region.\nNot much is known about their rule, and their reign is often considered a relatively obscure period in Indian history.\n\nSatavahana Dynasty (c. 230 BCE \u2013 220 CE):\n\nThe Satavahanas ruled in the Deccan region and parts of South India.\nThey are known for their contributions to trade and administration, as well as their patronage of Buddhism.\nThe Satavahana rulers played a key role in connecting the northern and southern regions of India through their control of trade routes.\n\nKushan Empire (c. 1st-3rd centuries CE):\n\nThe Kushans were a Central Asian dynasty that established their rule in parts of North India.\nThe empire was known for its cultural exchange, with influences from Central Asia, Persia, and India.\nThe Kushans played a significant role in promoting trade along the Silk Road.\n\nGupta Empire (c. 320-550 CE):\n\nThe Gupta Empire is often considered a post-Maurya power, even though it emerged centuries later.\nThe Guptas ruled a substantial part of North India and are known for their contributions to art, culture, and governance during the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of India.\nThe Gupta period witnessed advancements in science, mathematics, and literature, and the flourishing of Hindu and Buddhist art and architecture.\n\nVakataka Dynasty (c. 3rd-5th centuries CE):\n\nThe Vakatakas ruled in the Deccan region after the decline of the Satavahanas.\nThe dynasty is known for its architectural achievements, with notable cave temples at Ajanta.\nThe Vakatakas played a role in the cultural and religious developments of the Deccan.\n\nCompiled by\u00a0Vibin Lakshmanan"

We will also learn about imperial Cholas.\n\nThe reference material for this post is NCERT History text for Class 7\u00a0(Our past -1). Only main points from the chapters are compiled below. These points might come quite handy during preparation of Prelims and Mains, to get a quick grasp of the subject.\n\nNew Kings and Kingdoms\n\nMany dynasties emerged during 7th century.\nBy the 7th century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent.\nExisting kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. As these samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha- mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on.\nSometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords.\nRashtrakutas in the Deccan is one such instance. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord.\nIn each states, resources were obtained from the producers, that is, peasants, cattle-keepers, artisans, who were often persuaded or compelled to surrender part of what they produced.\nPrashastis contain details that may not be literally true. But they tell us how rulers wanted to depict themselves \u2013 as valiant, victorious warriors, for example.\nHowever author named Kalhana composed Sanskrit poems in 12th century and he was critical about the rulers and their policies.\nKanauj in the Ganga valley was a prized area. For centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara-Pratihara, Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for control over Kanauj. Historians often describe it as the \u201ctripartite struggle\u201d.\nRulers also tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples.\nSultan Mahmud of Ghazni, Afghanistan [ruled 997-1030] and extended control over Central Asia, Iran and north-west parts of subcontinent used to attack these temples including Somnath of Gujarat.\nAl-Biruni, Gazni\u2019s trusted scholar was made to write about to subcontinent he conquered. This arabic wrok Kitanb-al-Hind sought help from Sankrit scholars too.\nChauhans /Chahamanas, who ruled over the region around Delhi and Ajmer.\nThey attempted to expand their control to the west and the east, where they were opposed by the Chalukyas of Gujarat and the Gahadavalas of western Uttar Pradesh.\nThe best-known Chahamana ruler was Prithviraja III (1168-1192), who defeated an Afghan ruler named Sultan Muhammad Ghori in 1191, but lost to him the very next year, in 1192.\nTHE CHOLAS\nVijayalaya, who belonged to the ancient chiefly family of the Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. He built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess Nishumbhasudini there.\nThe successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring regions and the kingdom grew.\nRajaraja I, considered the most powerful Chola ruler, became king in AD 985 and expanded the control.\nRajaraja\u2019s son Rajendra I continued his policies and even raided the Ganga valley, Sri Lanka and countries of Southeast Asia, developing a navy for these expeditions.\nThe big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikonda- cholapuram, built by Rajaraja and Rajendra.\nChola temples often became the nuclei of settlements which grew around them. And these temples were not only places of worship; they were the hub of economic, social and cultural life as well.\nMany of the achievements of the Cholas were made possible through new developments in agriculture.\nSettlements of peasants, known as ur, became prosperous with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups of such villages formed larger units called nadu.\nThe village council and the nadu had several administrative functions including dispensing justice and collecting taxes.\nRich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of the nadu under the supervision of the central Chola govt.\n\nCompiled by : Vibin Lakshmanan"

Who were the major rulers of Delhi during the medieval period? Hopefully, you will get answers to these questions in this post.\n\nDelhi became an important city only in the 12th century.\nDelhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the Chauhans.\nRajput Dynasty\nTomaras [early twelfth century \u2013 1165]\nAnanga Pala [1130 -1145]\nChauhans [1165 -1192]\nPrithviraj Chauhan [1175 -1192]\nDelhi Sultans\nBy the 13th century, Sultanates transformed Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent.\n\u201cHistories\u201d, tarikh (singular) / tawarikh (plural), written in Persian, the language of administration under the Delhi Sultans by learned men: secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers who lived in cities (mainly Delhi) and hardly ever in villages.\nObjectives of these writings : (a) They often wrote their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards (b) they advised rulers on the need to preserve an \u201cideal\u201d social order based on birthright and gender distinctions \u00a0(c) their ideas were not shared by everybody.\nIn 1236 Sultan Iltutmish\u2019s daughter, Raziyya, became Sultan. Nobles were not happy at her attempts to rule independently. She was removed from the throne in 1240.\nEarly Turkish \u00a0[1206-1290]\nQutbuddin Aybak [1206 -1210]\nShamsuddin Iltutmish [1210 -1236]\nRaziyya [1236 -1240]\nGhiyasuddin Balban [1266 -1287]\nThe expansion of the Delhi Sultanate\nDelhi Sultanate \u2013 Boundaries\nIn the early 13th century the control of the Delhi Sultans rarely went beyond heavily fortified towns occupied by garrisons.\nThe Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland, the lands adjacent to a city or port that supplied it with goods and services, of the cities and were therefore dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies.\nControlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult.\nThe state was also challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled.\nThe expansion occurred during the reigns of Ghiyasuddin Balban, Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq.\nKhalji Dynasty\u00a0[1290 \u2013 1320]\nJalaluddin Khalji [1290 \u2013 1296]\nAlauddin Khalji [1296 -1316]\nTughluq Dynasty\u00a0\u00a0[1320 \u2013 1414]\nGhiyasuddin Tughluq [1320-1324]\nMuhammad Tughluq [1324 -1351]\nFiruz Shah Tughluq [1351 -1388]\nSo, the first thing Sultans did was consolidate these hinterlands of the garrison towns. During these campaigns forests were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and hunter-gatherers and pastoralists were expelled from their habitat.\nThese lands were given to peasants and agriculture was encouraged. New fortresses and towns were established to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade.\nSecondly, expansion occurred along the \u201cexternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate. Military expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and culminated with Muhammad Tughluq.\nAdministration & Consolidation\nRather than appointing aristocrats as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan .\nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often their clients, to high political positions.\nSlaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs.\nAuthors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices.\nMilitary commanders were appointed as governors of territories. This land is called iqta and their holder is called iqtadar or muqti .\u00a0The duty of muqti was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas.\nBut still large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans.\nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq.\nA.Khalji\u2019s defensive policy against Genghis\nAs a defensive measure, Alauddin Khalji raised a large standing army.\nConstructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers.\nIn order to feed soldiers, produce was collected as tax from lands, and paddy had got fixed tax of 50% of the yield.\nAlauddin chose to pay his soldiers\u2019 salaries in cash rather than iqtas. He made sure merchants sold supplies to these soldiers according to prescribed prices.\nSo here A.Khalji\u2019s administrative measures were highly praised due to effective intervention in markets to have prices under control.\nHe successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions.\nM.Tughluq\u2019s offensive policy against Genghis\nThe Mongol army was defeated earlier. M.Tughluq still raised a large standing army.\nRather than constructing a new garrison town, he emptied the residents of a Delhi city named Delhi-i Kuhna and the soldiers garrisoned there.\nProduce from the same area was collected as tax and additional taxes to feed the large army. This coincided with famine in the area. .\nMuhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency. This cheap currency could be counterfeited easily because it was made of \u201cbronze\u201d.\nHis campaign in Kashmir was a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army.\nHis administrative measures created complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And finally, the \u201ctoken\u201d currency had to be recalled.\n15th & 16th Century Sultanates: Sayyid, Lodi and Suri\nSayyid Dynasty\u00a0[1414 \u2013 1451]\nKhizr Khan 1414 -1421\nLodi Dynasty\u00a0[1451 \u2013 1526]\nBahlul Lodi 1451 -1489\nSuri Dynasty\u00a0[1540-1555]\nSher Shah Suri [1540-1545] captured Delhi.\nFor the first time during the Islamic conquest the relationship between the people and the ruler was systematized, with little oppression or corruption.\nHe challenged and defeated the Mughal emperor Humayun (1539 : Battle of Chausa, 1540 : Battle of Kannauj)\nSher Shah introduced an administration that borrowed elements from Alauddin Khalji and made them more efficient.\nSher Shah\u2019s administration became the model followed by the great emperor Akbar (1556-1605) when he consolidated the Mughal Empire.\nHis tomb is at Sasaram [Bihar]\n\nCompiled by: Vibin Lakshmanan"

I. Lodhi tried to create a strong centralised empire which alarmed Afghan chiefs as well as Rajaputs.\nSo in 1526 he defeated the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi and his Afghan supporters, at (First) Panipat (War) and captured Delhi and Agra.\nThe establishment of an empire in the Indo-Gangetic valley by Babur was a threat to Rana Sanga.\nSo in 1527 \u2013 defeated Rana Sanga, Rajput rulers and allies at Khanwa [a place west of Agra].\nBabur\u2019s advent was significant :\nKabul and Qandhar became an integral part of an empire\u00a0\u00a0 comprising North India . Since these areas had always acted as a staging place for an invasion of India and provide security from external invasions\nThese two areas mentioned above helped to strengthen India\u2019s foreign trade with China and Mediterranean seaports .\nHis war tactics were very expensive since he used heavy artillery which ended the era of small kingdoms because these smaller ones cant afford it .\nHe introduced a concept of the state which has to be based on strength and prestige of Crown instead of religious interference. This provided a precedent and direction to his successors .\nHumayun [1530-1540, 1555-1556]\nHumayun divided his inheritance according to the will of his father. His brothers were each given a province.\nSher Khan defeated Humayun which made him forced to flee to Iran.\nIn Iran, Humayun received help from the Safavid Shah. He recaptured Delhi in 1555 but died in an accident the following year.\nAkbar [1556-1605] \u2013 The Most Popular Ruler among the Mughal Dynasty\n\nHis reign can be divided into three periods :\n\n1556-1570 : Military campaigns were launched against the Suris and other Afghans, against the neighbouring kingdoms of Malwa and Gondwana, and to suppress the revolt of Mirza Hakim and the Uzbegs. In 1568 the Sisodiya capital of Chittor was seized and in 1569 Ranthambhor.\n1570-1585 : military campaigns in Gujarat were followed by campaigns in the east in Bihar, Bengal and Orissa.\n1585-1605 : expansion of Akbar\u2019s empire. Qandahar was seized from the Safavids, Kashmir was annexed, as also Kabul . Campaigns in the Deccan started and Berar, Khandesh and parts of Ahmadnagar were annexed.\nJahangir [1605-1627]\nMilitary campaigns started by Akbar continued.\nThe Sisodiya ruler of Mewar, Amar Singh, accepted Mughal service. Less successful campaigns against the Sikhs, the Ahoms and Ahmadnagar followed.\nShah Jahan [1627-1658]\nMughal campaigns continued in the Deccan under Shah Jahan.\nThe Afghan noble Khan Jahan Lodi rebelled and was defeated.\nIn the north-west, the campaign to seize Balkh from the Uzbegs was unsuccessful and Qandahar was lost to the Safavids.\nShah Jahan was imprisoned by his son Aurangazeb for the rest of his life in Agra.\nAurangzeb [1658-1707]\nIn the north-east, the Ahoms [a kingdom in Assam near Brahmaputra valley] were defeated in 1663, but they rebelled again in the 1680s. Because Ahoms successfully resisted Mughal expansion for a long time and they dont want to give up their sovereignty which they were enjoying for 600 years .\nCampaigns in the north-west against the Yusufzai and the Sikhs were temporarily successful.\nMughal intervention in the succession and internal politics of the Rathor Rajputs of Marwar led to their rebellion.\nCampaigns against the Maratha chieftain Shivaji were initially successful. However, escaped from Aurangzeb\u2019s prison Shivaji declared himself an independent king and resumed his campaigns against the Mughals.\nPrince Akbar[II] rebelled against Aurangzeb and received support from the Marathas and Deccan Sultanate.\nAfter Akbar\u2019s rebellion, Aurangzeb sent armies against the Deccan Sultanates. Bijapur[Karnataka] was annexed in 1685 and Golcunda [Telangana] in 1687.\nFrom 1698 Aurangzeb personally managed campaigns in the Deccan against the Marathas who started guerrilla warfare.\nAurangzeb also had to face the rebellion in north India of the Sikhs, Jats and Satnamis . The Satnamis were a sect of Hinduism and they were resented against Aurangzeb\u2019s strict Islamic policies \u2013 which included reviving the hated Islamic Jiziya tax (poll tax on non-Muslim subjects), banning music and art, and destroying Hindu temples .\nMughal relations with other rulers\nThe Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept their authority.\nHowever, as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined them voluntarily. eg : Rajaputs.\nThe careful balance between defeating but not humiliating their opponents [but not with Shivaji by Aurangzeb] enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains.\nMansabdars and Jagirdars\nAs the empire expanded to encompass different regions the Mughals recruited diverse bodies of people like Iranians, Indian Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other groups.\nThose who joined Mughal service were enrolled as mansabdars \u2013 an individual who holds a mansab, meaning a position or rank.\nIt was a grading system used by the Mughals to fix rank, salary and military responsibilities.\nThe mansabdar\u2019s military responsibilities required him to maintain a specified number of sawar or cavalrymen.\nMansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments \u2013 jagirs which were somewhat like iqtas. But unlike muqtis, mansabdars dint administer jagirs, instead only had rights to collect the revenue that too by their servants while manasbdars themselves served in some other part of the country.\nIn Akbar\u2019s reign, these jagirs were carefully assessed so that their revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansabdar.\nBut by Auragzeb\u2019s reign, there was a huge increase in the number of mansabdars which meant a long wait before they received a jagir.\nSo the shortage of jagirdars was witnessed and whoever got jagirs they extracted more revenue than allowed .\nAurangzeb couldn\u2019t control this development and the peasantry therefore suffered tremendously.\nZabt and Zamindars\nTo sustain Mughal administration , rulers relied on extracting taxes from rural produce[peasantry].\nMughal used one term \u2013 zamindars \u2013 to describe all intermediaries, whether they were local headmen of villages or powerful chieftains who collect these taxes for rulers.\nCareful survey was done to evaluate crop yields .\nOn the basis of this data , the tax was fixed.\nEach province was divided into revenue circles with its own schedule of revenue rates for individual crops. This revenue system was known as zabt.\nHowever, rebellious zamindars were present . They challenged the stability of the Mughal Empire from the end of the 17th century through peasant revolt.\nAkbar Nama & Ain-i Akbari\nAbul Fazl wrote a three volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign titled, Akbar Nama .\nThe first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors .\nThe second recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign.\nThe third is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and geography of his empire. It provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. It also got statistical details about crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues.\nAkbar\u2019s policies\nThe empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions.\nSubadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal).\nEach province had a financial officer or diwan.\nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue.\nAkbar\u2019s discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians took place in the ibadat khana.\nHe realised that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d.\nAbul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul.\nThis principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well.\n17th century and after\n\nDespite economical and commercial prosperity inequalities were a glaring fact. Poverty existed side by side with the greatest opulence.\nAt the time of Shahjahan\u2019s reign, highest ranking mansabdars were nominal and they are the ones who receive maximum salaries than others .\nThe scale of revenue collection[tax] left very little for investment [in tools and supplies] in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan.\nAs the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh but still were loyal to Mughals.\nBy the 18th century, the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities.\n\nAlso read: Medieval Indian History Books and Authors\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCompiled by : Vibin Lakshmanan"

The salary of a Mansabdar was based on his Zat.\n\nThe \u2018Sawar\u2019 refered to cavalary men Mansabdar had to maintain. Mansabdar also had to keep horses ready.\n\nZat vs Sawar\nZat \u2014 Denote the rank in the administration\nZat \u2014 Denote the Salary of the Mansabdar\nSawar \u2014 Denote the number of cavalry men Mansabdar had to maintain.\n\nNote: Even if the Sawar rank was higher, the mansabdar\u2019s position in the official hierarchy would not be affected. It will be decided only by the Zat rank.\n\nFor example, a mansabdar with 5000 Zat and 2000 Sawar was higher in rank than a Mansabdar of 4000 Zat and 3000 Sawar.\nHowever, there were exceptions to this rule particularly when the mansabdar was serving in a difficult terrain.\n\nMilitary responsibilities of Mansabdars\nThe Mansabdar was required to maintain a specified number of cavalrymen.\nThe Mansabdar was required to maintain a specified number of horses.\nThe mansabdar had to bring his cavalrymen for review and get them registered.\nThe mansabdar had also get their horses branded.\nHierarchy within the Mansabdars\nAmir: Those mansabdars whose rank was 1000 or below were called Amir.\nGreat Amir: Those mansabdars above 1,000 were called Amir-al Kabir (Great Amir).\nAmir of Amirs: Some great Amirs whose ranks were above 5,000 were also given the title of Amir-al Umara (Amir of Amirs).\nSalary of Mansabdars: In cash and land\n\nThe Mansabdars were paid according to their ranks. They were paid a good amount of money.\n\nThose Mansabdars, who were paid in cash, were called Naqdi.\n\nThose Mansabdars who were paid through land (Jagirs) were called Jagirdars.\n\nIt is to be remembered that it is not land that was assigned but only the right to collect revenue or income from the piece of land.\n\nNo mansabdar could hold on to the said Jagir for a long term as they were liable for transfer. Mansabdars were not supposed to accumulate their salaries and wealth. After the death of a mansabdar, all his jagirs and wealth was confiscated. As a result, Mansabders used to spend lavishly. In short, they had no option but to spoil their earning.\n\nThe Mansabdars\u2019 (Jagirdar\u2019s) lands were not hereditary!\n\nThe Mansab\u2019s post or honour or dignity was not hereditary and it lapsed after the death or dismissal of the Mansabdar. Mansabdar\u2019s property returned to the state after his demise.\n\nWho introduced Mansabdari in India?\n\nThe Mansabdar appears to be a Central Asian institution. There is a view that this institution came to India with Babur. However, during Babur\u2019s time, instead of the term of Mansabdar, the term Wajahdar was used.\n\nIt was under the regime of Akbar when Mansabdari system became the basis of military and civil administration.\n\nDid Mansabdars reside in their Jagirs (land allotted to them)?\n\nAll\u00a0mansabdars\u00a0did\u00a0not reside\u00a0in\u00a0their own\u00a0jagirs\u00a0but\u00a0used servants\u00a0to\u00a0collect revenues there\u00a0while\u00a0they themselves served\u00a0in\u00a0another part\u00a0of the\u00a0empire.\n\nNote: The Delhi Sultanate (The Khalji and the Tughlaq monarchs) too appointed military commanders as governers of territories. These land were called the Iqta and the landholders were called Iqtadars or the muqti. Most of the Muqti stayed in their Iqta unlike Jagirdars.\n\nIqtadari vs Mansabdari (Jagirdari)\nThe Iqtadari system was used by the Delhi Sultans, while Mansabdari was used by Mughal rulers.\nWhile Iqtedari system was in force, the whole land of the Empire was divided into two parts \u2013 one which belonged to Iqtedars and the other which belonged to the emperor. But in Jagirdari, the whole land belonged to the Emperor.\nItqadar was the officer in charge of the revenue collection and distribution. Jagirdar had law and order responsibility in addition to the revenue collection.\nMost of the Muqti stayed in their Iqta, unlike Jagirdars.\nInitially, \u2018Iqta\u2019 was a revenue-yielding piece of land which was assigned in lieu of salary \u2013 just like \u2018Jagir\u2019. However, Iqtadari system became hereditary in its later days whereas the Mansabdari system was never hereditary.\nMansabdar was a royal officer in charge of revenue collection and law and order duties \u2013 who was paid salary either as cash or as land. He used to deduct his own cut before sending the remaining share to the emperor.\nThe number of Mansabdars during Mugal Rule\n\nAkbar maintained 1,803 Mansabdars, by the end of the reign of Aurangzeb, their number rose to 14,499.\n\nIn Akbar\u2019s reign, there were 29 mansabdars with a rank of 5,000 zat; by Aurangzeb\u2019s reign the number of mansabdars with a zat of 5000 had increased to 79.\n\nThe increase of the number of Mansabdars during the reign of Aurangzeb led to the Jagirdari and agrarian crisis which led to the collapse of the Mansabdari system.\n\nThe fall of the Manasabdari System\n\nIn Akbar\u2019s reign, the system worked near perfect. The revenue collected by the Mansabdar from his jagirs (and transferred to the Emperor) was enough to pay his assigned salary as well.\n\nThese jagirs, in the initial days, were carefully assessed so that their revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansabdar.\n\nHowever, in the later stage, there was a shortage of jagirs. Also, the size of the jagirs started to shrink.\n\nIn the Aurengazeb era, the revenue collected by Mansabdars for the government was not enough to pay the salary assigned to them.\n\nMansabdari System: Terms that you should understand\nMashrut = conditional rank = which means an increase of sawar rank for a short period.\nTajwiz: Tajwiz was a petition presented by a nobleman to the emperor, recommending that an applicant be recruited as mansabdar.\nDu-aspah and Sih-aspah: These were features added later to the Mansabdari system by Jahangir. This is a system whereby the selected nobles could be allowed to maintain a larger quota of troopers, without raising their Zat rank. The system was popular as \u2018du-aspah\u2019 (a trooper with two horses) or \u2018sih-aspah\u2019 (a trooper with three horses) system. As you can understand, this was related to the sawar rank.\nMansabdari System: Summary\n\nThe Mansab system was a grading system used by the Mughal rulers to fix the rank and salary of a Mansabdar, who were basically royal officers.\n\nThe mansabdars were nobles who acted as military commanders, high civil and military officers, and provincial governors.\n\nThere was no distinction between the civil and military departments. Both civil and military officers held mansabs and were liable to be transferred from one branch of the administration to another.\n\nThe rank of a Mansabdar was determined by the number of horses and cavalrymen he maintained.\n\nDownload ClearIAS Learning App for more videos\n\nFor more videos like this, download ClearIAS Learning App.\n\nIf you liked the presentation, subscribe ClearIAS YouTube Channel not to miss future updates.\n\nHappy Learning!\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, the Mansabdari System was a unique administrative and military system developed by the Mughal Emperor Akbar in the 16th century in India.\n\nUnder this system, officials were assigned ranks (mansabs) based on their military skills and administrative capabilities, which determined their pay and the number of troops they were expected to maintain.\n\nIt helped in the efficient organization of the military and administration, as well as in ensuring the loyalty and accountability of officials to the emperor."

These points might come quite handy during preparation of Prelims and Mains to get a quick grasp of the subject.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRulers and Buildings \u2013 Medieval India\nEngineering Skills and Construction\nBuilding Temples, Tanks and Mosques\nReligious construction: Why were temples constructed and destructed?\nGardens, Tombs and Forts\nRegion and Empire\nSample questions to think from UPSC Mains perspective\nSample questions to think from UPSC Prelims perspective\nRulers and Buildings \u2013 Medieval India\nBetween the 8th and the 18th centuries kings and their officers built two kinds of structures: First were forts, palaces and tombs. Second were structures meant for public activity including temples, mosques, tanks, wells, bazaars.\nBy making structures for subjects\u2019 use and comfort, rulers hoped to win their praise.\nConstruction activity was also carried out by others, including merchants.\u00a0However, domestic architecture \u2013 large mansions (havelis) of merchants \u2013 has survived only from the eighteenth century.\nEngineering Skills and Construction\n\nMonuments provide an insight into the technologie used for construction.\nBetween the 7th and 10th centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings using \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d design.\nCorbelled: roofs, doors and windows were made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns.\n\nFrom the 12th century onwards certain changes were visible .\n\n\u201cArcuate\u201c type design started to appear. Here the weight of the superstructure above doors and windows was carried by the arches .\u00a0The \u201ckeystone\u201d at the centre of the arch transferred the weight of the superstructure to the base of the arch.\nLimestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high quality cement .\nBuilding Temples, Tanks and Mosques\nHindu rulers took gods\u2019 name. Eg: Rajarajeshvara temple was built by King Rajarajadeva for the worship of his god, Rajarajeshvaram.\nMuslim Sultans and Padshahs did not claim to be incarnations of god but Persian court chronicles\ndescribed the Sultan as the \u201cShadow of God\u201d.\nWater availability: Sultan Iltutmish [13th century] won respect for constructing a large reservoir just outside Dehli-i kuhna. It was called the hauz-i Sultani or the \u201cKing\u2019s Reservoir\u201d.\nReligious construction: Why were temples constructed and destructed?\nAs each new dynasty came to power, kings/emperors wanted to emphasise their moral right to be rulers.\nSo constructing places of worship provided rulers with the chance to proclaim their close relationship with God, especially important in an age of rapid political change.\nBecause kings built temples to demonstrate their devotion to God and their power and wealth, it is not surprising that when they attacked one another\u2019s kingdoms, they often targeted these buildings. (Eg:\u00a0Pandyan king Shrimara Shrivallabha,\u00a0Chola king Rajendra I,\u00a0Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni etc.)\nGardens, Tombs and Forts\n\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex.\nDuring Babur reign formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. These gardens were known as chahar bagh,\u00a0four gardens.\nThe central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb.\nAssociated with the chahar bagh there was tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms.\nDuring Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a harmonious synthesis. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas or am) were carefully planned. These courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls, placed within a large courtyard.\nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer.\nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi.\nCourt in Redfort by Shahjahan got a series of pietra dura [a Roman Art by inlaying of pieces of coloured stones resulting into some images] inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute[a string instrument]\nThe construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals where all could live together in harmony.\nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden [a variation of chahar bagh] in the layout of the Taj Mahal.\nOnly specially favoured nobles were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna.\nRegion and Empire\nThere was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one region were adopted by another. In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golcunda.\nIn Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very\nsimilar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri.\nMughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings.\nSample questions to think from UPSC Mains perspective\nWhile studying history of India during Medieval period, it can be seen that most rulers spend considerable time and effort in building religious structures or buidlings.

Only main points from the chapters are compiled below. These points might come quite handy during preparation of Prelims and Mains to get a quick grasp of the subject.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTowns of Medieval India\nAdministrative Centres and\u00a0Towns\nTemple Towns and Pilgrimage Centres\nSmall towns\nTraders\nCraftpersons\nMajor Towns: Surat, Hampi and Masulipattanam\nHampi\nSurat\nMasulipatnam\nUPSC Prelims Question from the topic\nTowns of Medieval India\n\nThere were administrative centres, temple towns, as well as centres of commercial activities and craft production during medieval periods.\n\nAdministrative Centres and\u00a0Towns\nThe best example is\u00a0Thanjavur.\nDuring the reign of Chola Dynasty (King Rajaraja Chola), its capital was Thanjavur.\nArchitect Kunjaramallan Rajaraja Perunthachchan built Rajarajeshwara Temple.\nBesides the temple, there were palaces with mandapas or pavilions. where kings hold court here and issue order to subordinates.\nThe Saliya weavers of Thanjavur and the nearby town of Uraiyur were busy producing cloth for flags to be used in the temple festival, fine cottons for the king and nobility and coarse cotton for the masses.\nSome distance away at Svamimalai, the sthapatis or sculptors were making exquisite bronze idols and tall, ornamental bell metal lamps.\nTemple Towns and Pilgrimage Centres\nThanjavur is also an example of a temple town. Temple towns represent a very important pattern of urbanisation, the process by which cities develop.\nTowns emerged around temples such as those of Bhillasvamin (Bhilsa or Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh), and Somnath in Gujarat. Other important temple towns included Kanchipuram and Madurai in Tamil Nadu, and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh.\nPilgrimage centres also slowly developed into townships. Vrindavan (Uttar Pradesh) and Tiruvannamalai (Tamil Nadu) are examples of two such towns.\nSmall towns\nFrom the 8th century onwards the subcontinent was dotted with several small towns. These probably emerged from large villages. They usually had a mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby villagers brought their produce to sell. They also had market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined with shops.\nUsually a samanta or, in later times, a zamindar built a fortified palace in or near these towns. They levied taxes on traders, artisans and articles of trade and sometimes \u201cdonated\u201d the \u201cright\u201d to collect these taxes to local temples .\nTraders\nThere were many kind of traders including Banjaras. (2016 Prelims Question)\nSince traders had to pass through many kingdoms and forests, they usually travelled in caravans and formed guilds[associations for certain tasks]to protect their interests. Manigramam and Nanadesi were two such guilds.These guilds traded extensively both within the peninsula and with Southeast Asia and China.\nThe towns on the west coast were home to Arab, Persian, Chinese, Jewish and Syrian Christian traders.\nAt the same time Kabul [Afghanistan]became politically and commercially important from the 16th century onwards. Trade in horses was primarily carried here. Slaves were also brought here for sale.\nCraftpersons\nThe craftspersons of Bidar were so famed for their inlay work in copper and silver that it came to\nbe called Bidri.\nThe Panchalas or Vishwakarma community, consisting of goldsmiths, bronzesmiths, blacksmiths, masons and carpenters, were essential to the building of temples.\nThey also played an important role in the construction of palaces, big buildings, tanks and reservoirs.\nSimilarly, weavers such as the Saliyar or Kaikkolars emerged as prosperous communities, making donations to temples.\nSome aspects of cloth making like cotton cleaning, spinning and dyeing became specialised and independent crafts.\nMajor Towns: Surat, Hampi and Masulipattanam\n\nSurat, Hampi and Masulipattanam were the major towns in India during the medieval period.\n\nHampi\n\nLocated in the Krishna-Tungabhadra basin.\nIt was the nucleus of the Vijayanagara Empire (1336).\nNo mortar or cementing agent was used in the construction of fortified walls and the technique followed was to wedge them together by interlocking.\nIt got splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures.\nDuring 15th \u2013 16th centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities. Moors (a name used collectively for Muslim merchants), Chettis and agents of European traders such as the Portuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi.\nTemples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis (temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple.\nHampi fell into ruin following the defeat of Vijayanagara in 1565 by the Deccani Sultans \u2013 the rulers of Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar and Bidar.\nSurat\nIt was an emporium of western trade during the Mughal period along with Cambay (present Khambat).\nSurat was the gateway for trade with West Asia via the Gulf of Ormuz. Surat has also been called the gate to Mecca because many pilgrim ships set sail from here.\nIn the 17th century the Portuguese, Dutch and English had their factories and warehouses at Surat.\nThe textiles of Surat were famous for their gold lace borders (zari) and had a market in West Asia, Africa and Europe.\nDecline factors: the loss of markets and productivity, control of the sea routes by the Portuguese, competition from Bombay where the English East India Company shifted its headquarters in 1668.\nMasulipatnam\nLay on the delta of the Krishna river.\nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam.\nThe fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch.\nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies.\nIn 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda.\nSo European Companies took alternatives to Bombay, Calcutta and Madras which lost Masulipatanam\u2019s glory.\nUPSC Prelims Question from the topic\n\nQn 2016: Banjaras during the medieval period of Indian history were\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAgriculture\nWarriors\nWeavers\nTraders\n\nArticle compiled by: Vibin Laxmanan"

These rules, as prescribed by the Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers of large kingdoms.\u00a0Under the Delhi Sultans and the Mughals, the hierarchy between social classes grew further.\n\nHowever, there were other societies as well. Many societies in the subcontinent did not follow the social rules and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas. Nor were they divided into numerous unequal classes. Such societies are often called tribes.\n\nBeyond Big Cities: Tribal Societies\nSome powerful tribes controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar tribe was very influential during the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\u00a0Kamal Khan Gakkhar, of Gakkhar tribe, was a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar.\nIn Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated extensive regions before they were subdued by the Mughals.\nIn the western Himalayas lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis.\nThe distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was entirely dominated by tribes \u2013 the Nagas, Ahoms, etc.\nIn many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, Chero, chiefdoms had emerged by the 12th century. Raja Man Singh, Akbar\u2019s general, attacked and defeated them in 1591.\nThe Maharashtra highlands and Karnataka were home to Kolis[also in Gujarat], Berads, etc.\nSouth got Koragas, Vetars, Maravars etc.\nBhils spread across western and central India.

This idea, advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era.\n\nIntense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various kinds of bhakti and Sufi movements that have evolved since the eighth century.\u00a0The idea of bhakti became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas adopted these beliefs.\n\nBhakti cult\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nBhakti was accepted as a means to attain moksha along with jnana and karma. The development of this cult took place in South India when the Nayanars and Alwars moved against the austerities propagated by the Buddhist and Jain schools and professed that ultimate devotion to god was the means to salvation.\n\nPeople were no longer satisfied with a religion which emphasized only ceremonies. The cult is the combined result of the teachings of various saints, through the then times. Each of them had their own views, but the ultimate basis of the cult was a general awakening against useless religious practices and unnecessary strictness. The cult also emerged as a strong platform against casteism.\n\nSome of the important leaders of the movement are:\n\nNamadeva and Ramananda (Maharashtra and Allahabad) \u2013 Both of them taught the concept of bhakti to all the four varnas and disregarded the ban on people of different castes cooking together and sharing meals.\nSankara and Ramanuja \u2013 The propounders of Advaita (non-duality) and vishishta adwaitha (qualified non-duality) respectively. They believed god to be nirguna parabrahma and satguna parabrahma respectively.\nVallabhacharya \u2013 propounder of shuddha adwaitha or pure non-duality.\nChaitanya (Bengal) \u2013 relied on the use of music, dance and bhajans to get in touch with God. \u2018love\u2019 was the watchword of the chaitanya cult.\nKabir \u2013 was a disciple of Ramananda, and was raised by a Muslim weaver. He stood for doing away with all the unnecessary customs and rituals in both religions and bringing union between these religions.\nGuru Nanak.\nNimbakacharya \u2013 founder of the Radha-Krishna cult. He expressed this relation to substantiate the importance of marriage. It was also used as an example of God\u2019s love to the people.\n\nRead:\u00a0Women of Bhakti Movement\n\nNayanars and\u00a0Alvars\nIn South India 7th to 9th centuries saw the emergence of new religious movements, led by the Nayanars (saints devoted to Shiva) and Alvars (saints devoted to Vishnu) who came from all castes including those considered \u201cuntouchable\u201d like the Pulaiyar and the Panars.\nThey were sharply critical of the Buddhists and Jainas.\nThey drew upon the ideals of love and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (Tamil literature).\nBetween 10th and 12th centuries the Chola and Pandya kings built elaborate temples around many of the shrines visited by the saint-poets, strengthening the links between the bhakti tradition and temple worship.\nPhilosophy and Bhakti\nShankara, from Kerala in the 8th century, salvation .was an advocate of Advaita or the doctrine of the oneness of the individual soul and the Supreme God which is the Ultimate Reality.\nHe taught that Brahman, the only or Ultimate Reality, was formless and without any attributes.\nHe considered the world around us to be an illusion or maya, and preached renunciation of the world and adoption of the path of knowledge to understand the true nature of Brahman salvation.\nRamanuja, from Tamil Nadu in the 11th century, propounded the doctrine of Vishishtadvaita or qualified oneness in that the soul, even when united with the Supreme God, remained distinct.\nRamanuja\u2019s doctrine inspired the new strand of bhakti which developed in north India subsequently.\nBasavanna\u2019s Virashaivism\nThis movement began in Karnataka in the 12th century which argued for the equality of all human beings and against Brahmanical ideas about caste and the treatment of women.\nThey were also against all forms of ritual and idol worship.\nSaints of Maharashtra\nThe most important among them were Janeshwar, Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well as women like Sakkubai and the family of Chokhamela, who belonged to the \u201cuntouchable\u201d Mahar caste.\nThis regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people.\nThese saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth.\nIt is regarded as a humanist idea, as they insisted that bhakti lay in sharing others\u2019 pain.\nNathpanthis, Siddhas, and Yogis\nCriticised the ritual and other aspects of conventional religion and the social order, using simple, logical arguments.\nThey advocated renunciation of the world.\nTo them, the path to salvation lay in meditation on the formless Ultimate Reality and the realization of oneness with it.\nTo achieve this they advocated intense training of the mind and body through practices like yogasanas, breathing exercises and meditation.\nThese groups became particularly popular among \u201clow\u201d castes.\nSaint Kabir\nProbably lived in the 15th-16th centuries.\nWe get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers.\nSome of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani, and Bijak.\nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, rejection of the major religious traditions and caste systems. He believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion.\nThe language of his poetry was simple and could even be understood by ordinary people.\nHe sometimes used cryptic language, which was difficult to follow.\nHe drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims.\nSufi Movement and Islam\n\nThe word Sufi means wool. The preachers from Arabia wore wool to protect themselves from dust winds. The Sufi movement is believed to have begun in Persian countries against the highly puritan Islamic culture.\n\nLater, it spread into India and adopted various things like yogic postures, dance and music into it, and turned itself into a pantheistic movement. The Sufi orders were of two types \u2013\u00a0ba-shara and be-shara, where shara stood for the Islamic law. The former obeyed the laws while the latter was more liberal.\n\nThe saints organized themselves into twelve silsilas or orders. The important among them were the Chisti and Suhrawardi silsilas, both of which belonged to the ba-shara order.\n\nThe Chisti Silsila was begun by Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti who came to India around 1192. None of his records remain, and he is widely known through the writings of his disciples and followers. The most famous of the Chisti saints were Nizamuddin Auliya and Naziruddin chirag-i-Delhi. They mingled freely with people of low classes, even Hindus. The chistis didn\u2019t want anything to do with the administration or money. They led simple austere lives.\n\nThis was just the opposite in the case of the suhrawardi saints who were rich, and often held positions in the government. Bahauddin Zachariah suhrawardi is a famous saint from this silsila.\n\nThere were two streams in general \u2013 wahdat-ul-wujud (doctrine of the unity of god) and wahdat-ul-shuhud (philosophy of apprenticism). The latter was found only in the nakshbandi silsila, which was a highly puritan Islamic silsila.\n\nTHINGS TO NOTE:\nSufis were Muslim mystics and who composed poems.\nThey adopted many ideas of each other[religions].\nThey rejected outward religiosity and emphasized love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings.\nSilsilas, a genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice.\nIslam propagated strict monotheism or submission to one God. Muslim scholars developed a holy law called Shariat.\nThe Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars.\nBaba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) and Sikhism\n\nEstablished a centre at Kartarpur named Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi.\nThe sacred space thus created by Guru Nanak was known as dharmsal. It is now known as Gurdwar.\nBefore his death Guru appointed Lehna also known as Guru Angad as his successor.\nGuru Angad compiled the compositions of Guru Nanak, to which he added his own in a new script known as Gurmukhi.\nThe three successors of Guru Angad also wrote under the name of \u201cNanak\u201d and all of their compositions were compiled by Guru Arjan [5th Guru who was executed by Jehangir]in 1604.\nThe compilation was added with the writings of other figures like Shaikh Farid, Sant Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh Bahadur.\nIn 1706 this compilation was authenticated by Guru Gobind Singh. It is now known as Guru Granth Sahib.\nDue to Guru Nanak\u2019s insistence that all the followers should adopt productive and useful occupations had received wider support during 16th century and followers increased, henceforth.\nBy the beginning of the 17th century, the town of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around the central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple). It was virtually self-governing and also referred as \u2018a state within the state\u2019 community. This fumed Mughal emperor Jahangir which led to the execution of Guru Arjan in 1606.\nThe Sikh movement began to get politicized in the 17th century, a development which culminated in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699 and this entity is called as Khalsa Panth.\nGuru Nanak\u2019s idea of equality had social and political implications because his idea of liberation was not that of a state of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with a strong sense of social commitment.\n\nAlso read: Socio-Religious Movements in India\n\nSummary\n\nThe coming of the Turks to the Indian sub-continent led to a revamp of culture, religion, architecture and almost all fields of life. This was due to the two strongly established religious views that confluence here. The strong Islamic views of the Turks combined with the established Hinduistic culture already prevalent in India. Both Sufism and Bhakti cult were out-of-the-box thoughts on religion. They were mainly against the common religious views, and most importantly, they both were strongly against the caste system.\n\nArticle by: Vibin Lakshmanan and Unnikrishna Varma"

        "[CONTENT]": "Medieval India (roughly from the 6th to the 18th century) witnessed the coexistence and interactions of various regional cultures, each with its unique characteristics, traditions, and historical developments. Read here to learn more.\n\nDuring this period, different dynasties and empires ruled different parts of the Indian subcontinent, contributing to the diverse cultural landscape.\n\nThe frontiers separating regions have evolved and are still changing. What we understand as regional cultures today are often the product of complex processes of intermixing local traditions with ideas from other parts of the subcontinent. In this post, let us quickly go through some of the regional cultures of India during the medieval period.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nKerala: The Cheras and Malayalam\nOrissa: The Jagannatha Cult\nRajastan: The Rajputs\nThe Story of Kathak\nMiniature Paintings\nBengal: Language and Literature\nPirs and Temples\nBengal: Fish as food\nKerala: The Cheras and Malayalam\n\nThe Chera kingdom of Mahodayapuram was established in the 9th century in the southwestern part of the peninsula, part of present-day Kerala.\nMalayalam was likely spoken in this area.\nThe rulers introduced the Malayalam language and script in their inscriptions. This development is considered one of the earliest examples of the use of a regional language in official records in the subcontinent.\n\u00a0At the same time, the Cheras also drew upon Sanskritic traditions. A 14th-century text, the Lilatilakam, dealing with grammar and poetics, was composed in Manipravalam \u2013 literally, \u201cdiamonds and corals\u201d referring to the two languages, Sanskrit, and the regional language.\n\nOrissa: The Jagannatha Cult\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn some areas, regional cultures grew around regional traditions\u00a0eg: Jagannatha cult of Puri (Odisha).\n\u00a0As the temple gained importance as a center of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased.\n\u00a0Mughals, Marathas, and the English East India Company all attempted to gain control over the temple because it could make rule acceptable to local people.\nRajastan: The Rajputs\n\nThe Rajputs are often recognized as contributing to the distinctive culture of Rajasthan.\nRulers like Prithviraj cherished the ideal of the hero who fought valiantly, often choosing death on the battlefield rather than face defeat.\nWomen are also depicted as following their heroic husbands in both life and death \u2013 there are stories about the practice of sati.\nThe Story of Kathak\n\nDance from Kathak was originally a caste of storytellers in temples of north India.\nKathak began evolving into a distinct mode of dance in the 15th and 16th centuries with the spread of the bhakti movement.\nThe legends of Radha-Krishna were enacted in folk plays called rasa lila, which combined folk dance with the basic gestures of the kathak storytellers.\nDuring the Mughal period, Kathak acquired a distinctive style that is still followed today.\nKathak, like several other cultural practices, was viewed with disfavor by most British administrators in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nRecognized as one of the \u201cclassical\u201d forms of dance in the country after independence.\nMiniature Paintings\n\nAs the name suggests, small-sized paintings, are generally done in watercolor on cloth or paper.\nSome of these are found in Western India and were used to illustrate Jaina texts.\nWith the decline of the Mughal Empire, many painters moved out to the courts of the emerging regional states.\n\u00a0As a result, Mughal artistic tastes influenced the regional courts of the Deccan and the Rajput courts of Rajasthan.\nPortraits of rulers and court scenes came to be painted, following the Mughal example.\nHimalayan foothills attracted miniature painting which is known as \u201cBasohli\u201d.The most popular text to be painted here was Bhanudatta\u2019s Rasamanjari.\nKangara school of paintings got inspiration from Vaishnavite traditions. Soft colors including cool blues and greens and a lyrical treatment of themes distinguished Kangra\u2019s painting.\nBengal: Language and Literature\n\nWhile Bengali is now recognized as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did the new language emerge?\n\nFrom the fourth-third century BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century, the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger.\n\nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the center of a regional kingdom under the Palas. Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of the rulers in Delhi. In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language.\n\nBy the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal.\n\nThus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of\nevolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali.\nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories \u2013 one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of it.\n\nThe first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally\nauspicious poems, dealing with local deities), and bhakti literature such as the biographies of\nChaitanya Deva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement.\n\nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories\nconcerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales, and ballads. The Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of yogic practices.\n\nPirs and Temples\n\nPirs were community leaders, who also functioned as teachers and adjudicators and were sometimes ascribed with supernatural powers.\n\nThe early settlers in eastern India sought some order and assurance in the unstable conditions of the new settlements. This was provided by Pirs.\n\nThe term \u2018Pirs\u2019 included saints or Sufis and other religious personalities, daring colonizers and deified soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities, and even animistic spirits. The cult of pirs became very popular and their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal.\n\nBengal also witnessed a temple-building spree from the late fifteenth century, which culminated in the\nnineteenth century.\u00a0Many of the modest brick and terracotta temples in Bengal were built with the support of several \u201clow\u201d social groups, such as the Kolu (oil pressers) and the Kansari (bell metal workers).\n\nWhen local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts in villages, gained the recognition of the Brahmanas, their images began to be housed in temples. The temples began to copy the double-roofed (dochala) or four-roofed (chauchala) structure of the thatched huts.\n\nBengal: Fish as food\n\nBengal is a riverine plain that produces plenty of rice and fish. Understandably, these two items figure prominently in the menu of even poor Bengalis.\n\nBrahmanas were not allowed to eat non-vegetarian food, but the popularity of fish in the local diet made the Brahmanical authorities relax this prohibition for the Bengal Brahmanas. The Brihaddharma Purana, a thirteenth-century Sanskrit text from Bengal, permitted the local Brahmanas to eat certain varieties of fish.\n\nThese regional cultures contributed to the rich tapestry of medieval Indian history, showcasing the diversity of artistic, linguistic, and social expressions across different parts of the subcontinent. The interactions and exchanges between these cultures have left a lasting impact on the cultural heritage of modern India.\n\nRead:\u00a0Medieval Indian Books and Authors\n\nArticle by: Vibin Lakshmanan"

Stay updated with our latest content and enhance your exam readiness.\n\nThrough the 18th century, the Mughal Empire gradually fragmented into a number of independent, regional states.\nIt can be divided into three overlapping groups:\nStates that were old Mughal provinces like Awadh, Bengal, and Hyderabad. Although extremely powerful and quite independent, the rulers of these states did not break their formal ties with the Mughal emperor.\nStates that had enjoyed considerable independence under the Mughals as watan jagirs. These included several Rajput principalities.\nStates under the control of Marathas, Sikhs and others like the Jats. They all had seized their independence from the Mughals after a long-drawn armed struggle.\nHyderabad\nNizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of Hyderabad state, was appointed by Mughal Emperor Farrukh Siyar.\nHe was entrusted first with the governorship of Awadh, and later given charge of the Deccan.\nHe ruled quite independently without seeking any direction from Delhi or facing any interference.\nThe state of Hyderabad was constantly engaged in a struggle against the Marathas to the west and with independent Telugu warrior chiefs (nayakas)\nAwadh\nBurhan-ul-Mulk Sa\u2018adat Khan was appointed subadar of Awadh in 1722.\nAwadh was a prosperous region, controlling the rich alluvial Ganga plain and the main trade route between north India and Bengal.\nBurhan-ul-Mulk held the combined offices of subadari, diwani and faujdari.\nBurhan-ul-Mulk tried to decrease Mughal influence in the Awadh region by reducing the number of office holders (jagirdars) appointed by the Mughals.\nThe state depended on local bankers and mahajans for loans.\nIt sold the right to collect the tax to the highest bidders. These \u201crevenue farmers\u201d (ijaradars) agreed to pay the state a fixed sum of money. So they were also given considerable freedom in the assessment and collection of taxes.\nThese developments allowed new social groups, like moneylenders and bankers, to influence the management of the state\u2019s revenue system, something which had not occurred in the past.\nBengal\nBengal gradually broke away from Mughal control under Murshid Quli Khan who was appointed as the naib, deputy to the governor of the province and he was neither a formal subadar .\nLike the rulers of Hyderabad and Awadh, he also commanded the revenue administration of the state.\nIn an effort to reduce Mughal influence in Bengal he transferred all Mughal jagirdars to Orissa and ordered a major reassessment of the revenues of Bengal.\nRevenue was collected in cash with great strictness from all zamindars.\nThis shows that all 3 States Hyderabad, Awadh, Bengal richest merchants, and bankers were gaining a stake in the new political order.\nThe Watan Jagirs of the Rajputs\nMany Rajput kings, particularly those belonging to Amber and Jodhpur, were permitted to enjoy considerable autonomy in their watan jagirs.\nIn the 18th century, these rulers now attempted to extend their control over adjacent regions.\nSo Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur held the governorship of Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber was governor of Malwa.\nThey also tried to extend their territories by seizing portions of imperial territories neighbouring their watans.\nSeizing Independence\nThe Sikhs\nThe organisation of the Sikhs into a political community during the seventeenth century helped in regional state-building in the Punjab.\nGuru Gobind Singh fought against the Rajaput and Mughal rulers, after this death, it was under Banda Bahadur\u2019s the fight continued.\nThe entire body used to meet at Amritsar at the time of Baisakhi and Diwali to take collective decisions known as \u201cresolutions of the Guru (gurmatas)\u201d.\nA system called rakhi was introduced, offering protection to cultivators on the payment of a tax of 20 per cent of the produce.\nTheir well-knit organization enabled them to put up a successful resistance to the Mughal governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who had seized the rich province of the Punjab and the Sarkar of Sirhind from the Mughals.\nThe Khalsa declared their sovereign rule by striking their own coin in 1765. The coin was same as that of Band Bahadur\u2019s time.\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh reunited the groups and established his capital at Lahore in 1799.\nThe Marathas\nAnother powerful regional kingdom to arise out of a sustained opposition to the Mughal rule.\nShivaji (1627-1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families (deshmukhs). Groups of highly mobile, peasant- pastoralists (kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha army.\nPoona became the capital of the Maratha kingdom.\nAfter Shivaji, Peshwas[principal ministers] developed a very successful military organisation by raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas where their supply lines and reinforcements could be easily disturbed.\nBy the 1730s, the Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to levy chauth[25 per cent of the land revenue claimed by zamindars]. and sardeshmukhi[9-10 per cent of the land revenue paid to the head revenue collector in the Deccan] in the entire region.\nThe frontiers of Maratha domination expanded, after raiding Delhi in 1737, but these areas were not formally included in the Maratha empire but were made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha sovereignty.\nThese military campaigns made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas during the third battle of Panipat in 1761.\nBy all accounts cities[Malwa, Ujjain etc] were large and prosperous and functioned as important ant commercial and cultural centers show the effective administration capacities of Marathas.\nThe Jats\nJats too consolidated their power during the late 17th and 18th-centuries.\nUnder their leader, Churaman, they acquired control over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi, and by the 1680s they had begun dominating the region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and Agra.\nThe Jats were prosperous agriculturists, and towns like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became important trading centers in the areas dominated by them.\nWhen Nadir Shah (Shah of Iran) sacked Delhi in 1739, many of the city\u2019s notables took refuge there.\nHis son Jawahir Shah had troops and assembled some another from Maratha and Sikh to fight Mughal.\nEmergence of British as a Supreme Power\n\nBy 1765, the British had successfully grabbed major chunks of territory in eastern India.

India in 1750\n\nAlmost the whole of India was centrally administered under the great Mughal rule in the early 1700s.\n\nAurangzeb, who is widely considered as the last effective ruler of the Mughal Empire ruled over almost the entire Indian subcontinent for a period of 49 years, until 1707.\n\nWith the death of Aurangzeb, the power shifted to the hands of Later Mughals (1707-1857) who were weak in administration.\n\nThis led to the decline of the Mughal Empire and the rise of autonomous states like Hyderbad, Carnatic, Bengal and Awadh. Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, and Afghans created new states. Mysore, Kerala, and Rajput area also became independent kingdoms.\n\nLearn more: India in 1750 \u2013 Decline of the Mughal Empire, Rule of Later Mughals, and Emergence of Successor States\n\n2. British Expansion\n\nWith the emergence of capitalism and imperialism in Europe, many Europeans arrived in the Indian sub-continent for trade.\n\nLater, when their ambitions grew, they tried to establish colonies in India.\n\nThe European powers included the Portuguese, the Dutch (Netherland), the French, the Danes, and the English.\n\nThe British became successful in the power struggle among the European countries and gained control over different areas in India.\n\nAfter defeating colonial powers like France (Carnatic Wars), the British expanded its territories in India by conquering local rulers (Anglo-Mysore war and Anglo-Maratha war).\n\nLater, the British conquered and annexed the North Indian states like Sindh, Punjab, and Awadh.\n\nLearn more: The British Expansion in India \u2013 East India Company, Presidencies, Governor-generals, and Battles\n\n3. Changes introduced by the British\n\nOnce the British gained power, She introduced many changes in the Economic, Political, and Social spheres.\n\nUnder the Economic arena, aspirants need to study the British policies towards agriculture and industry.\n\nUnder the Polity angle, students should learn various Acts passed by the English which lead to the constitutional development like the Regulating Act of 1773, Pitts India Act 1784, various Charter Acts etc. Students should also learn the administration part \u2013 particularly the revenue administration, civil services, police, army, and judicial services.\n\nUnder the Social angle, the British policies towards education, language, culture etc should be covered.\n\nLearn more: The changes introduced by the British in India.\n\n4. Popular Uprisings and Revolts against the British\n\nMany of the policies and changes introduced by the British were unfavourable to most of the Indians.\n\nThis resulted in a lot of local uprisings and revolts against the English rule and policies like the Sanyasi-Fakir Rebellion, Khond Uprisings, Santhal Rebellion, Bhil Uprisings, Mappila Uprisings etc.\n\nA major revolt against the English East India Company was the Revolt of I857, which is popularly known as the First War of Independence.\n\nHowever, most of these revolts were unsuccessful and failed to overpower British rule.\n\nLearn more: Popular Uprisings and Revolts against the British\n\n5. Socio-Religious Movements\n\nThe policies of the British like Engish Education resulted in an awakening in east, west, north and south India.\n\nThis resulted in reform movements \u2013 mostly on the religious lines (Muslim reform movements, Sikh reform movements, Parsi reform movements, Hindu reform movements).\n\nWhile some of the reform movements were against the policies of the British, others were aimed at reforming Indian society.\n\nThe reform movements paved way for an organised nationalism in India \u2013 which was divided across social, political, and economic dimensions.\n\nLearn more: Socio-Religious Movements in India\n\n6. The emergence of Indian Nationalism and India\u2019s struggle for independence\n\nDifferent political associations started to form in Bengal, Bombay and Madras. However, the Indian National Congress (INC) formed in 1885 turned the foundational stone of organised nationalism in India. Crores of people who were oppressed under the foreign British rule started to unite and demanded their rights and representation.\n\nThe early phase of the Indian National Congress is known as the Moderate Phase (1885-1905). Later, with the rise of militant nationalism and radical politics, extremists started to gain prominence. The extremist phase (1905-1918) is marked by major events like the Partition of Bengal, Swadeshi movement, Revolutionary Terrorist movement, Ghadar movement, Home Rule movement etc.\n\nBy 1918, Mahatma Gandhi emerged as an influential leader in Indian Politics. He was actively involved in the Khilafat movement and the Non-Cooperation Movement (1919-1922).\n\nThe later period witnessed the emergence of new parties and movements within and outside Congress like the Swaraj Party, the Revolutionary Terrorist Movement, the Communist Party, the peasant movements, the worker\u2019s movements, the states\u2019 peoples movement etc.\n\nHowever, Indian National Congress remained the central party which received massive support from all sectors.\n\nGandhi launched the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930.\n\nThe British tried to pacify Indians by conducting three Round Table Conferences, without much success.\n\nOver the years, Indian National Congress pressed for more power and representation to Indians. Various acts passed by the British Parliament led to constitutional development and resulted in the legislature, executive, and judiciary in British India.\n\nElections were conducted in 1937, however, the hopes of Indian democracy were short-lived because of the 2nd world war.\n\nGandhi started Quit India Movement in 1942 with an aim to end the British rule in India.\n\nVarious negotiations were attempted for a peaceful settlement and freedom. However, the extreme communalism at that period resulted in the Partition of British India into Pakistan and India.\n\nIndia achieved independence on 15th August 1947.\n\nLearn more: India\u2019s struggle for independence\n\nHow to learn modern Indian History from ClearIAS?\n\nNote: Subscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel to learn more.\n\nClearIAS publishes online notes on various subjects which can be accessed from our free study materials link in the Menu.\n\nOnce you come across any note about modern Indian History on the ClearIAS website, associate that with the 6-part structure of Indian History as formulated in this post. This will help you learn in an organised way. This will also make your foundation strong.\n\nYou should not limit your learning to mainstream leaders or movements. Nowadays, UPSC frames questions from the subaltern perspective too.\n\nNote: A\u00a0subaltern\u00a0is someone with a low ranking in a social, political, or other hierarchy. It can also mean someone who has been marginalized or oppressed.\n\nDue to its extensive nature of various subjects, we do not claim that ClearIAS notes are complete or enough for UPSC preparation.\n\nOnce a basic idea is formed from ClearIAS notes, I recommend you supplement your learning with authoritative textbooks. Remember, Textbooks, Test-Series, and Techniques are the core 3T\u2019s in the ClearIAS approach of learning.\n\nBooks that can help you learn Modern Indian History for UPSC\n\nFrom the UPSC exam perspective, I recommend UPSC aspirants to depend on Modern Indian History by Sonali Bansal and Snehil Tripathi for preparation. Even though a bit heavy, this book is highly reader-friendly and helps aspirants cover priority topics for Prelims and Mains in an orderly fashion.\n\nIf you have time constraints, don\u2019t try to learn everything mentioned in this book line by line, but rather try to understand the contents of the book on the backdrop of the 6-part structure of Indian History as formulated in this article.\n\nAnother popular book among aspirants is \u2018A Brief History of Modern India\u2018 authored by Rajiv Ahir and published by Spectrum Publications. You can buy either of the two books.\n\nNCERTs books (Class 6-12) and Tamil Nadu SCERT textbooks are also good sources for Modern Indian History Preparation.\n\nFor History enthusiasts who have further time, links to a few other good textbooks are also provided below.\n\nHistory Of Modern India by Bipan Chandra.

He was 65 when he ascended the throne.\n\nIn the beginning, he tried to exercise more control over Amber and Marwar, but in the end, ended up giving them high mansabs.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHe also granted the Marathas the sardeshmukhi of Deccan but failed to give them the chauth. Thus, the Marathas were not fully satisfied.\n\nHe also tried to pacify the Sikhs by giving Guru Gobind Singh high mansabs. But later, he also crushed a rebellion by Banda Bahadur, who was Gobind Singh\u2019s successor.\n\nHe died in 1712, and the empire plunged into rebellion once again.\n\n(2) Jahandar Shah (1712-1713):\n\nIt was now that the era of kingmakers in the history of India started.\n\nOne of Bahadur Shah\u2019s less able sons, Jahandar Shah won the throne with the help and support of Zulfiqar Khan, the most powerful noble of the time. The prince was the least interested in administration and it passed into the hands of Zulfiqar. His policies, however, were, clever and progressive.\n\nHe knew that he had to establish friendly relations with the Rajput rajas and Maratha sardars, and other local clans. Thus, he took the necessary steps towards it. The demands of Marwar and Amber which were not satisfied by Bahadur Shah were addressed. He abolished jizyah. He also granted the Marathas the chauth and sardeshmukhi of Deccan. One of his hated policies was the introduction of irjarah or revenue farming.\n\nWhen the nobles grew jealous of the position of Zulfiqar Khan, they poisoned the ears of the emperor against him. This led to misunderstandings between them. Finally, Jahandar Shah was defeated at Agra by his nephew Farrukh Siyar.\n\n(3) Farukh Siyar and The Saiyyids (1713-1720):\n\nFarukh Siyar was supported by the Saiyyid brothers \u2013 Hussain Ali Khan Barahow and Abdulla Khan. They were made the mir-bakshi and wazir respectively. The fate was the same for this king too, as his ears were poisoned against the nobles. But in the end, the Saiyyid brothers themselves deposed and killed him.\n\nAfter this, they brought two successive emperors to the crown and both died in quick succession, Muhammad Shah was their next choice.\n\nThe Saiyyids adopted the policy of religious tolerance. They brought Hindu chiefs into the administrative fold. They also followed conciliatory policies with other rulers and granted Shahu with swarajya. However, they were considered as namak-haram by the others nobles, who feared for their lives, seeing the fate of the king himself. They conspired against the Saiyyids and treacherously murdered them in 1720.\n\n(4) Muhammad Shah (1719-1748):\n\nHis reign however continued even after the death of the Saiyyds. In fact, he had a hand in the conspiracy against them. Even though the conditions were favourable for the consolidation of the Mughal empire, he was not the man of the moment. The empire fell into total disarray during his time. This led to the birth of new states, which were created by the deputies of the emperors.\n\nThe successor states\n\nIn India, several successor states to the Mughals emerged.\n\n(1) Hyderabad:\n\nIt was founded by Nizam-ul-mulk Asaf Jhah in 1724. Although he was made the wazir of the Mughal empire in 1722 itself, he didn\u2019t believe in a return of the Mughal empire. So, right from 1720, he had strengthened his control over Deccan, though he never laid an independent claim to it.\n\nHe waged wars and concluded treaties. He followed a policy of religious tolerance in his state. He died in 1748.\n\n(2) Bengal:\n\nThis state was founded by Murshid Khuli Khan and Alivardi Khan.\n\nEven though MKK was the governor there since 1717, he had been its de-facto ruler since 1700. Though he was virtually independent, he regularly sent tributes to the emperor to ensure his seat. He died in 1727 and his son Shuja-ud-din ruled till 1739. In that year, Alivardi Khan killed his son and became the ruler there.\n\nIt was during MKK\u2019s rule that land was categorised and khalisah lands were introduced. He also gave agricultural loans called taccavis to the farmers.\n\n(3) Awadh:\n\nIt was founded by Saadat Khan Burhan-ul-mulk who was appointed as its governor in 1722.\n\nHe carried out a fresh revenue settlement in 1723. He too did not show any religious discrimination. He continued the jagir system. Before his death in 1739, he had become virtually independent and had made his position hereditary.\n\nHe was followed by his nephew Safdar Jung who was also a good administrator. Following his predecessor\u2019s policy of religious tolerance, he also employed Hindus in important posts. He ruled till 1754.\n\n(4) Mysore:\n\nThe first ruler of Mysore was Hyder Ali who was a petty officer in the Mysore army. He gradually rose through the wars as a leader.\n\nThough illiterate, he was a visionary and realised the importance of western military equipment. He too was religiously tolerant. He died in 1782 and was succeeded by his son Tipu.\n\nTipu was everything his father was, only better. Taking a great interest in the French revolution, he planted a tree of liberty at Srirangapatanam. He also made a modern navy and incorporated various western weapons into his army.\n\nPerhaps, he is the only Indian ruler who realised the full extent of the threat posed by the British. Though he was orthodox in religious views, he was tolerant of other religions too.\n\nThe Economic Condition of India in the 1750s\n\nMughal India in 1700 accounted for 25 per cent of the world Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nHowever, India also had 25 per cent of the world\u2019s population.\n\nIndia\u2019s per capita GDP was only half that of Britain\u2019s in 1600 when the Mughal Empire was at its peak. Thereafter India witnessed a steady economic decline.\n\nThe land revenue system at the time of the Mughals was exploitative in nature. The elite class held a major share of national income.\n\nIndia in 1750, on the eve of the British conquest, had no scientific or technological research, no machinery, and no mechanical tools.\n\nIndian rulers rarely invested in technology when the Europeans were rapidly making progress in science and technology. Indian trade was heavily dependent on textile exports. They were unable to compete with cheaper European cloth.\n\nLearn more\n\nThis article is the 1st part of the article series on Modern Indian History.

How did the British who came to India for trade become the rulers of territories?\n\nThere had been trading relations between India and the West from ancient times (land route).\n\nHowever, in 1453, the Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople and this brought the regular trade routes under the control of the Turks. This urged the Europeans to search for new trade routes, especially by sea.\n\nIn 1492, Columbus from Spain set out to reach India and discovered America instead.\n\nLater, in 1498, Vasco Da Gama of Portugal discovered a new trade route, traveling around Africa. He reached India at Calicut, Kerala (1498) acquiring the distinction of being the first European to reach India via the sea route.\n\nThe Portuguese were the first to establish colonies in India. Due to their superiority on the seas, they could easily maintain their positions against the powerful land forces in India. Also since they were mainly concentrated in south India, they did not have to face the might of the Mughal Empire.\n\nIn 1602, the Dutch East India Company was formed, and the people from the Netherlands were empowered by their government to make war, conclude treaties, acquire territories, and build fortresses.\n\nAlso read: Opium Wars: History and Aftermath\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGrowth of the English East India Company\nHow did the British who came to India for trade become the rulers of territories?\nEast India Company begins to trade in Bengal\nHow the trade led to battles?\nThe Battle of Plassey\nCompany Rule Expands\nConflict with Tipu Sultan\nConflict with the Marathas\nThe claim to paramountcy\nThe Doctrine of Lapse\nSetting up a New Administration\nRole of Governor Generals in the British conquests\nRobert Clive\nWarren Hastings\nWellesley\nHastings\nDalhousie\nLearn more\nBooks referred to prepare this article\nGrowth of the English East India Company\n\nIn 1599, an English company was formed by a group of merchants to trade with the east, known as Merchant Adventurers. It was given the permission and exclusive rights to trade with the east, by the queen in 1600.\n\nMughal emperor, Jahangir, gave captain Hawkins the royal farman to set up factories on the western coast. Later, Sir Thomas Roe obtained the farman to establish factories in all parts of the Mughal empire.\n\nBombay passed into the British hands as dowry given by the Portuguese. The British conflicts with the Dutch were settled by giving up all claims to Indonesia.\n\nThe conditions in the south were apt for the English. They started from Madras, by building a fort there, called Fort St. George. The problems broke out when the English sacked Hugli and declared war on the emperor. They failed miserably. This was the first lesson they learnt. From then on, they relied on flattery and humble entreaties, waiting for their chance. In 1698, Fort William was built and Calcutta was founded. Madras, Bombay and Calcutta soon grew up to be flourishing centres of trade.\n\nThe French, under Dupleix, who had come to India by then had already started interfering in the affairs of the local princes using their well-equipped army. In 1742, a war had broken out in Europe between France and England.\n\nFollowing the death of the nizam in 1748, his son Nasir Jung took over the crown. He was challenged by Muzaffar Jung, a grandson of the nizam. Similar situations were in the Carnatic, where Chanda Sahib was conspiring against the nawab Anwarudeen. The French took the sides of both the rebels, and won both of their claims for them, killing Anwarudeen and Nasir Jung. The English, naturally took the side of the fallen, under Muhammad Ali, a son of Anwarudeen. The wars were then won by the English side under the able generalship and cunning of Robert Clive. Finally, the French recalled Dupleix from India, according to their treaty in 1754.\u00a0 Later, in 1760, the French were completely destroyed at the battle of Wandiwash. Thus, the English remained the sole masters of India.\n\nThe farman granted to the British by the emperor enabled them to conduct free trade in Bengal. Neither did they have to pay dastaks for the movement of such goods. However, these were misused by the company\u2019s servants and this meant the loss of revenue for Bengal. In 1756, the grandson of Alivardi Khan, Siraj-ud-Daulah came to the throne, he demanded the English that they should trade on the same basis as the Indian merchants. Matters took a turn for the worse when the English refused and strengthened their fortifications. This led to the Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which Siraj-ud-Daulah was treacherously defeated by the cheating by Mir Jaffar and Rai Durlabh. This brought the British immense prestige and revenue.\n\nLater, when Mir Jaffar couldn\u2019t keep up with the tribute promised to the British, they installed Mir Qasim on the throne. He was clever and knew that both revenue and an army was required to stand against the British. And finally, he abolished all the duties on internal trade. This angered the British, and they defeated Mir Qasim in the Battle of Buxar in 1764.\n\nHow did the British who came to India for trade become the rulers of territories?\nIn 1600, the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England, Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the sole right to trade with the East. Then onwards no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company.\nHowever, the royal charter didn\u2019t prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets.\nThe Portuguese had already established their presence on the western coast of India and had their base in The Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene.\nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. So the only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets, therefore, led to fierce battles between the trading companies.\nTrade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification.\nEast India Company begins to trade in Bengal\nThe first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1651.\nBy 1696 it began building a fort around the settlement near the factory where merchants and traders\nThe company persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty-free.\nAurangzeb\u2019s farman had granted only the Company the right to trade duty-free. The officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. However, they did private trades without paying taxes, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal.\nThis behaviour led to a protest by the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan.\n\nAlso read: India-Portugal Relations\n\nHow the trade led to battles?\nWe have already seen that with the decline of Mughal rule, many successor states emerged.\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time.\nNawabs refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications.\nThe Company on its part declared that the trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts.\nThe conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey.\nThe Battle of Plassey\nSirajuddaulah, then Nawab of Bengal, with his force, captured the English factory at Kassimbazar and then went to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort.\nCompany officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed.\nFinally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey.\nClive had managed to secure the support of one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders named Mir Jafar by promising to make him Nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah.\nThe Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory for the English East India Company in India.\nThe Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of the administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade.\nBut Mir Jafar protested with the British on administrative matters. He was replaced by Mir Mir Qasim. He too had conflicts with the East India company. The Company defeated him in the Battle of Buxar (1764).\nEast India company now started to shift from their primary objective from trade to expansion of territories.\nIn 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal.\nNow revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta.\nCompany Rule Expands\nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1764), the Company appointed Residents in Indian states.\nThrough the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states.\nSometimes the Company forced the states into a \u201csubsidiary alliance\u201d. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They will be protected by the Company but had to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d that the Company maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as a penalty.\nConflict with Tipu Sultan\nMysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785 Tipu Sultan stopped the export of these substances through the ports of his kingdom and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company.\nHe also established a close relationship with the French in India and modernised his army with their help. All these made the British furious.\nFour wars were fought with Mysore (1767- 69, 1780-84, 1790-92 and 1799). Only in the last \u2013 the Battle of Seringapatam \u2013 did the Company ultimately got a victory.\nMysore was later placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state.\nConflict with the Marathas\nWith their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Marathas\u2019 dream of ruling from Delhi came to an end.\nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. In the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear winner.\nThe Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi.\nThe Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817-19 crushed the Maratha power.\nThe Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas.\nThe claim to paramountcy\nUnder Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823) a new policy of \u201cparamountcy\u201d was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, so it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom.\nThis view continued to guide later British policies.\nThese periods saw the British shifting the control the north-west because of Russian invasion fear.\nBritish fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842 and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over. In 1849, Punjab was annexed.\nThe Doctrine of Lapse\nThe final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1856 using Doctrine of Lapse policy.\nThe doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would \u201clapse\u201d, that is, become part of Company territory. Many kingdoms were annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Examples \u2013 Satara (1848), Sambalpur\u00a0 (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and Jhansi (1854).\nFinally, in 1856, the Company also took over Awadh. Now this time the British mentioned that they took over Awadh in order to free the people from the \u201cmisgovernment\u201d of the Nawab, which enraged by the Nawab who was deposed. The people of Awadh later joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857.\nSetting up a New Administration\nWarren Hastings (Governor-General 1773 to 1785) played a significant role in the expansion of Company power.\nBy his time the Company had acquired power not only in Bengal but also in Bombay and Madras and these were considered as administrative units called Presidencies.\nEach was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General.\nWarren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice.\nUnder the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal \u2013 the Sadar Nizamat Adalat \u2013 was also set up at Calcutta.\nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the Collector whose main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers etc.\nRole of Governor Generals in the British conquests\n\nWe shall try to understand what happened after Plassey and Buxar. The two battles made the Brits unquestioned champions of the land, but they still had obstacles to pass. These were the small states throughout the territory of India. The way some of the governors-general handled the situation and finally made the British the sole power in India is worth understanding.\n\nRobert Clive\n\nWe begin with Robert Clive (1765-72) who was given a second chance following his outstanding military leadership. He introduced a system known as \u2018dual administration\u2019 in Bengal. The company already had the power to collect its own taxes. Thus it was the diwan. Now, with the say in the appointment of the deputy subahdar, the company got the de-facto ownership of the nizamat too. Thus, in effect, the company had power without responsibility.\n\nIt was also during Clive\u2019s time that the taxation in Bengal became so favourable to the British that they stopped bringing money from England to buy Indian goods. Instead, they invested the revenue they received from Bengal in buying Indian goods itself. Then they sold it in foreign countries. These were called the \u2018investments\u2019 of the company in India.\n\nWarren Hastings\n\nThe next was Warren Hastings (1772-85), who had \u2018war\u2019 in his name itself. The interference in others\u2019 territories continued. Initially, he fought Mysore with the help of the Nizam, and later intervened in the internal politics of the Marathas, by siding with Raghunath Rao, against the infant Peshwa Madhav Rao 2, who was represented by Nana Phadnis. This long Anglo-Maratha war lasted from 1775 to 1782. It was at this time that he had to face the combined forces of the Marathas, the Nizam, and Mysore. But through tactics and turning one ruler against another, he fought his way through. In the first Anglo-Maratha war, the British couldn\u2019t do much. In the end, the treaty of Salbai was signed which maintained the status quo and gave them ample time to recover. This enabled them to fight with Hyder, in which they were helped by the Marathas.\n\nWar with Haider Ali started in 1780. Though Haider won initially, Hastings\u2019 cunning tactics helped the British in choking out deals with Nizam and the Marathas through the cessation of territories. In 1781, Haider Ali was defeated by Eyre Coot and later died in 1782. His son Tipu carried on the fight from 1789 but was defeated in 1792. Half of his treaties were ceded by the treaty of Seringapatanam.\n\nWellesley\n\nWellesley (1798-1805) was the next important Governor-General. By 1797, Mysore and Marathas were weakened in power. He knew it was the ripe time for rapid expansion. He followed the policy of \u2018Subsidiary alliances\u2019, outright wars, and assumption of territories of previously subordinated rulers. You know what the theory of a subsidiary alliance is. It was described as \u201ca system of fattening allies as we fatten oxen, till they were worthy of being devoured\u201d. The first was the Nizam in 1798 and 1800. Then came the Nawab of Awadh in 1801.\n\nAll this time, Tipu was strengthening himself. He had also asked for French help. But in 1799, before the French help could reach him, he fought a fierce war and died.\n\nAt this time, the Marathas were a confederacy of five factions namely the Peshwa (Poona), Gaekwad (Baroda), Sindhia (Gwalior), Holkar (Indore), and Bhonsle (Nagpur). Though Peshwa was the nominal head, these factions were constantly at war. When Peshwa Baji Rao 2 was defeated by Holkar, he took the treaty of Subsidiary alliance. Even then, it would have been really difficult for the British to defeat them, only if they stood together. But even in the face of imminent danger, they didn\u2019t unite. Thus, one or more factions stood and watched when another one fought the British and were defeated one by one.\n\nHowever, the expansionist policy of Wellesley was proving too costly to the government. Hence, he was recalled from India.\n\nHastings\n\nThe next Governor-General was Hastings (1813-1823). The Marathas decided to push one last time. They united to form a small group, but by now, it was too late. They were easily defeated. The Peshwas territories were annexed to the Bombay presidency. To satisfy them, a small kingdom of Satara was given to Shivaji\u2019s descendant who ruled it under the British.\n\nThus, by 1818, the entire subcontinent, except Punjab and Sind was under the British. They completed this task by 1857. The growing Anglo-Russian rivalry in Europe and Asia caused the fear of a Russian attack from the North-West. Sind was a friendly state to the British. Still, in 1843, Charles Napier conquered it. He later wrote, \u201cWe have no right to seize Sind, yet we shall do so, and a very advantageous, useful humane piece of rascality it will be\u201d.\n\nDalhousie\n\nDalhousie (1848-1856) was the next Governor-General. He introduced the Doctrine of lapse, by which he annexed many small states like Satara in 1848, Nagpur and Jhansi in 1854, etc. This was a major cause of the Great revolt of 1857. He also wanted to conquer Awadh, but his doctrine wouldn\u2019t work there because the Nawab had many heirs. Thus, he accused him of having misgoverned the state, and annexed it on that pretext, in 1856.\n\nLearn more\n\nThis article is the 2nd part of the article series on Modern Indian History.

This resulted in the commercialisation of agriculture and the ruin of traditional Indian industries.\nPolity: Various Acts passed by the English had positive and negative outcomes. However, the most significant result of the new laws was the enforcement of the British authority over the Indian mainland. New laws like the Regulating Act of 1773, Pitts India Act of 1784, various Charter Acts etc led to constitutional development. On the administration part, too various changes were introduced \u2013 particularly the revenue administration, civil services, police, army, and judicial services.\nSociety: British policies towards education, language, and culture resulted in significant transformation in Indian society.

In 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out.\nNow, most Company officials began to feel that investment in the land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved.\nThis resulted in the introduction of many land-revenue systems like Zamindari, Mahalwari, and Ryotwari.\nPermanent Settlement (Zamindari)\nThe Company introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. Cornwallis was the Governor-General of India at that time. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars.\nThey were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently \u2013 it was not to be increased ever in future.\nThe Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land.\nThe revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by the Company.\nIn the 19th century, the situation changed. Now the market rose a bit. But Company never gained because it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently.\nOn the other hand, in the villages, the cultivator found the system extremely oppressive.\nMahalwari settlement\nThe company needed more money but the permanently fixed revenues couldn\u2019t help them in this regard.\nSo in North-Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822.\nHe felt that the village was an important social institution.\nUnder his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups.\nThe estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village (mahal) had to pay.\nThis demand was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed.\nThe charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement.\nRyotwari / Munro System\nEarlier Captain Alexander Read and later Thomas Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars.\nThe settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots ) who had tilled the land for generations.\nTheir fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made.\nIndigo plantation\nBy the 13th century, Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth. However, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached the European market and its price was very high.\nBy the end of the 18th century, Britain began to industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes.\nWhile the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons.\nBritain took it as an opportunity to persuade or force Indian cultivators to grow Indigo.\nHow was indigo cultivated?\nThere were two main systems of indigo cultivation \u2013 nij and ryoti .\nNij: the planter produced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers.\nRyoti system: the planters forced the ryots to sign a contract, an agreement (satta). Those who signed the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. When the crop was delivered to the planter after the harvest, a new loan was given to the ryot, and the cycle started all over. The price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle of loans never ended.\nThe planters usually insisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in which peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, moreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest, the land could not be sown with rice.\nThe \u201cBlue Rebellion\u201d and After\nIn 1859 thousands of ryots in Bengal refused to grow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters and attacked indigo factories.\nEven zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters so they supported ryots.\nWorried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to inquire into the system of indigo production.\nIt declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future.\nAfter the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal.\nHow did British rule affect the Cities: Ruling the Colonial Cities & Urbanisation\nThe European Commercial Companies had set up base in different places early during the Mughal era: the Portuguese in Panaji in 1510, the Dutch in Masulipatnam in 1605, the British in Madras in 1639 and the French in Pondicherry (present-day Puducherry) in 1673.\nFrom the mid-eighteenth century, there was a new phase of change. Commercial centres such as Surat, Masulipatnam and Dhaka, which had grown in the 17th century, declined when trade shifted to other places.\nCompany agents settled in Madras in 1639 and in Calcutta in 1690. Bombay was given to the Company in 1661 by the Portuguese. The Company established trading and administrative offices in each of these settlements.\nAfter the Battle of Plassey in 1757, and the trade of the English East India Company expanded, colonial port cities such as Madras, Calcutta and Bombay rapidly emerged as the new economic capitals.\nColonial records and urban history\nFrom the early years, the colonial government was keen on mapping. This knowledge provided better control over the region and helped to gauge commercial possibilities and plan strategies of taxation.\nFrom the late 19th century onwards the British handed over some responsibilities to elected Indian representatives to collect municipal taxes.\nThe growth of cities was monitored through regular headcounts. By the mid-19th century, several local censuses had been carried out in different regions. The first all-India census was attempted in 1872. Thereafter, from 1881, decennial (conducted every ten years) censuses became a regular feature. This collection of data is an invaluable source for studying urbanisation in India.\nHowever, the census process and its corresponding enumeration were riddled with ambiguity. The classification failed to capture the fluid and overlapping identities of people. for eg: a person who was both an artisan and a trader were difficult to classify. People themselves were never able to provide their real profession.\nTrends of change\nAfter 1800, urbanisation in India was slow-moving.\n19th century up to the first two decades of the 20th, the proportion of the urban population to the total population in India was extremely low and had remained stagnant.\nHowever, there were significant variations in the patterns of urban development in different regions. The smaller towns had little opportunity to grow economically. Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, on the other hand, grew rapidly and soon became sprawling cities.\nEarlier these three centres functioned as collection depots for the export of Indian manufacturers such as cotton But now become the entry point for British-manufactured goods and for the export of Indian raw materials.\nThe introduction of railways in 1853 meant a change in the fortunes of towns. Economic activity gradually shifted away from traditional towns which were located along old routes and rivers.\nWhat Were the New Towns Like?\nBy the 18th century Madras, Calcutta and Bombay had become important ports.\nThe English East India Company built its factories (i.e., mercantile offices) there and because of competition among the European companies, fortified these settlements for protection.\nIndian merchants, artisans and other workers who had economic dealings with European merchants lived outside these forts in settlements of their own.\nAfter the 1850s, cotton mills were set up by Indian merchants and entrepreneurs in Bombay, and European-owned jute mills were established on the outskirts of Calcutta. This was the beginning of modern industrial development in India.\nCalcutta, Bombay and Madras grew into large cities, but this did not signify any dramatic economic growth for colonial India as a whole.\nIndia never became a modern industrialised country, since discriminatory colonial policies limited the levels of industrial development.\nThe majority of the working population in these cities belonged to what economists classify as the tertiary sector.\nThere were only two proper \u201cindustrial cities\u201d: Kanpur, specialising in leather, woollen and cotton textiles, and Jamshedpur, specialising in steel.\nUrbanisation, a change since 1857\nAfter the Revolt of 1857 British attitudes in India was shaped by a constant fear of rebellion.\nThey felt that towns needed to be better defended, and white people had to live in more secure and segregated enclaves and new urban spaces called \u201cCivil Lines\u201d were set\nWhite people began to live in the Civil Lines. Cantonments \u2013 places where Indian troops under European command were stationed \u2013 were also developed as safe enclaves. These areas were separate from but attached to the Indian towns.\nFrom the 1860s and 1870s, stringent administrative measures regarding sanitation were implemented and building activity in the Indian towns was regulated. Underground piped water supply and sewerage and drainage systems were also put in place around this time. Sanitary vigilance thus became another way of regulating Indian towns.\n\nBuildings in cities included forts, government offices, educational institutions, etc were often meant to represent ideas such as imperial power and nationalism.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nLearn more\n\nThis article is the 3rd part of the article series on Modern Indian History.

However, the Paikas were eventually defeated by the British.\n\nKnow more about Paika Rebellion.\n\nThe Revolt of 1857\n\nSince the mid-eighteenth century, nawabs and rajas had seen their power getting eroded.\n\nMany ruling families tried to negotiate with the Company to protect their interests.\n\nThe Company even began to plan how to bring the Mughal dynasty to an end. The name of the Mughal king was removed from the coins minted by the Company.\n\nIn 1856, Governor-General Canning decided that Bahadur Shah Zafar would be the last Mughal king and after his death, none of his descendants would be recognised as kings \u2013 they would just be called princes.\n\nIn the countryside, peasants and zamindars resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection.\n\nThe Indian sepoys were unhappy about their pay, allowances and conditions of service. Some of the new rules, moreover, violated their religious sensibilities and beliefs.\n\nAfter a hundred years of conquest and administration, the English East India Company faced a massive rebellion that started in May 1857 and threatened the Company\u2019s very presence in India.\n\nThe Mutiny\nWhy did sepoys revolt? First, the sepoys considered that the British were promoting religious conversions in the unit; second sepoys were unhappy with their movements; thirdly sepoys were like \u201cpeasants in uniform\u201d so whenever the British tried new agricultural reforms it affected the sepoys and their families harshly which cause hatred towards the British.\nThe capture of Delhi and the proclamation of Bahadur Shah as the Emperor of Hindustan gave a positive political meaning to the Revolt.\nSouth India remained quiet and Punjab and Bengal were only marginally affected.\nIn the absence of any leaders from their own ranks, the insurgents turned to the traditional leaders of Indian society \u2014 the territorial aristocrats and feudal chiefs who had suffered at the hands of the British.\nAt Kanpur, the natural choice was Nana Saheb, the adopted son of the last Peshwa, Baji Rao II.\nIn Bihar, the Revolt was led by Kunwar Singh, the zamindar of Jagdishpur.\nAlthough the rebels received the sympathy of the people, the country as a whole was not behind them. The merchants, intelligentsia and Indian rulers not only kept aloof but actively supported the British.\nApart from some honourable exceptions like the Rani of Jhansi, Kunwar Singh and Maulvi Ahmadullah, the rebels were poorly served by their leaders.\nApart from a commonly shared hatred for the alien rule, the rebels had no political perspective or a definite vision of the future. They were all prisoners of their own past, fighting primarily to regain their lost privileges.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Indian Feudalism\n\nThe changes introduced by the British after the Revolt of 1857\n\nThe British had regained control of the country by the end of 1859, but they could not carry on ruling the land with the same policies anymore.\n\nChanges were introduced, henceforth :\n\nThe British Parliament passed a new Act in 1858 and transferred the powers of the East India Company to the British Crown in order to have direct responsibility for ruling India. A member of the British Cabinet was appointed Secretary of State for India and made responsible for all matters related to the governance of India. The Governor-General of India was given the title of Viceroy, that is, a personal representative of the Crown.\nAll ruling chiefs of the country were assured that their territory would never be annexed in future. However, they were made to acknowledge the British Queen as their Sovereign Paramount.\nIt was decided that the proportion of Indian soldiers in the army would be reduced and the number of European soldiers would be increased.\nThe land and property of Muslims were confiscated on a large scale and they were treated with suspicion and hostility.\nThe British decided to respect the customary religious and social practices of the people in India.\nPolicies were made to protect landlords and zamindars and give them the security of rights over their lands.\n\nNote: Even the failure of Sepoy Revolt served a grand purpose: a source of inspiration for the national liberation movement which later achieved what the Revolt could not.\n\nAlso read: Land Reforms in India \u2013 History and Status\n\nCivil Rebellions and Tribal Uprisings\n\nThe civil rebellions began as British rule was established in Bengal and Bihar, and they occurred in area after area as it was incorporated into the colonial rule.\n\nThe major cause of civil rebellions taken as a whole was the rapid changes the British introduced in the economy, administration and land revenue system.\n\nThese changes led to the disruption of the agrarian society, causing prolonged and widespread suffering among its constituents.\n\nThe ruin of Indian handicraft industries, as a result of the imposition of free trade in India and the levy of discriminatory tariffs against Indian goods in Britain, pauperized millions of artisans. The misery of the artisans was further compounded by the disappearance of their traditional patrons and buyers, the princes, chieftains, and zamindars.\n\nThe scholarly and priestly classes were also active in inciting hatred and rebellion against foreign rule.\n\nRebellions were massive in their totality, but were wholly local in their spread and isolated from each other. They often bore the same character not because they represented national or common efforts but because they represented common conditions though separated in time and space.\n\nSocially, economically and politically, the semi-feudal leaders of these rebellions were backwards-looking and traditional in outlook. Such backwards-looking and scattered, sporadic and disunited uprisings were incapable of fending off or overthrowing foreign rule.\n\nThe suppression of the civil rebellions was a major reason why the Revolt of 1857 did not spread to South India and most of Eastern and Western India. The historical significance of these civil uprisings lies in that they established strong and valuable local traditions of resistance to British rule.\n\nTribal Uprising\nColonialism also transformed their relationship with the forest.\nIt ended their relative isolation and freedom they enjoyed in forest life and brought them fully within the ambit of colonialism.\nIt encouraged the influx of Christian missionaries into the tribal areas. Above all, it introduced a large number of moneylenders, traders and revenue farmers as middlemen who were the chief instruments of exploiting forest\nGovt usurped the forest lands and placed restrictions on access to forest products, forest lands and village common lands and even curtailed tribals\u2019 traditional jhumming [shifting] cultivation.\nHowever, the complete disruption of the old agrarian order of the tribal communities provided the common factor for all the tribal uprisings.\nThe rebellions began at the point where the tribals felt they had no alternative but to fight. This often took the form of spontaneous attacks on outsiders, looting their property and expelling them from their villages.\nAmong the numerous tribal revolts, the Santhal hool or uprising was the most massive.\nThe Santhals, who live in the area between Bhagalpur and Rajmahal, known as Daman-i-koh, rose in revolt; made a determined attempt to expel the outsiders \u2014 the dikus \u2014 and proclaimed the complete \u2018annihilation\u2019 of the alien regime.\nThe rebellion (ulgulan ) of the Munda tribesmen, led by Birsa Munda, occurred during 1899-1900.\nPeasant Movements and Uprisings after 1857\n\nColonial economic policies, the new land revenue system, the colonial administrative and judicial systems, and the ruin of handicrafts leading to the over-crowding of land transformed the agrarian structure and impoverished the peasantry. When the peasants could take it no longer, they resisted this oppression and exploitation.\n\nThe most militant and widespread of the peasant movements was the Indigo Revolt of 1859-60.\n\nA major reason for the success of the Indigo Revolt was the tremendous cooperation, organization and discipline of the ryots. Another was the complete unity among Hindu and Muslim peasants. Leadership for the movement was provided by not just ryots but in some cases by petty zamindars, moneylenders and ex-employees of the planters.\n\nA significant feature of the Indigo Revolt was the role of the intelligentsia of Bengal which organized a powerful campaign in support of the rebellious peasantry. It carried on newspaper campaigns, organized mass meetings, prepared memoranda on peasants\u2019 grievances and supported them in their legal battles.\n\nMissionaries were another group that extended active support to the indigo ryots in their struggle.\n\nThe Government\u2019s response to the Revolt was rather restrained and not as harsh as in the case of civil rebellions and tribal uprisings.\n\nDuring the 1870s and early 1880s, Bengal was facing agrarian unrest, because of efforts by zamindars to enhance rent beyond legal limits and to prevent the tenants from acquiring occupancy rights under Act X of 1859.\n\nThis they tried to achieve through illegal coercive methods such as forced eviction and seizure of crops and cattle as well as by dragging the tenants into costly litigation in the courts. The peasants were no longer in a mood to tolerate such oppression.\n\nThe main form of struggle was that of legal resistance. There was very little violence \u2014 it only occurred when the zamindars tried to compel the ryots to submit to their terms by force.\n\nIt was not aimed at the zamindari system. The agrarian leagues kept within the bounds of the law, used the legal machinery to fight the zamindars, and raised no anti-British demands.\n\nSo official action was based on the enforcement of the Indian Penal Code and it did not take the form of armed repression as in the case of the Santhal and Munda uprisings.\n\nA major agrarian outbreak occurred in the Poona and Ahmednagar districts of Maharashtra in 1875. Here, as part of the Ryotwari system, land revenue was settled directly with the peasant who was also recognized as the owner of his land.\n\nPeasant resistance also developed in other parts of the country. Mappila outbreaks were endemic in Malabar.\n\nThe Kuka Revolt in Punjab was led by Baba Ram Singh.\n\nThere was a certain shift in the nature of peasant movements after 1857. Princes, chiefs and landlords having been crushed or co-opted, peasants emerged as the main force in agrarian movements. They now fought directly for their own demands, centred almost wholly on economic issues and against zamindars and moneylenders etc.\n\nOnce the specific objectives of a movement were achieved, its organization, as also peasant solidarity built around it, dissolved and disappeared. Thus, the Indigo strike, the Pabna agrarian leagues and the social-boycott movement of the Deccan ryots left behind no successors.\n\nConsequently, at no stage did these movements threaten British supremacy or even undermine it. In this respect, the colonial regime\u2019s treatment of the post-1857 peasant rebels was qualitatively different from its treatment of the participants in the civil rebellions, the Revolt of 1857 and the tribal uprisings which directly challenged colonial political power.\n\nA major weakness of the 19th-century peasant movements was the lack of an adequate understanding of colonialism \u2014 of colonial economic structure and the colonial state \u2014 and of the social framework of the movements themselves.\n\nMost of these weaknesses were overcome in the 20th century when peasant discontent was merged with the general anti-imperialist discontent, and their political activity became a part of the wider anti-imperialist movement.\n\nLearn more\n\nThis article is the 4th part of the article series on Modern Indian History.

Many leaders emerged to reform Indian society. They mostly aspired to revive the Indian society with modern values.\n\nKeshub Chandra Sen, for example, said: \u201cWhat we see around us today is a fallen nation \u2013 a nation whose primitive greatness lies buried in ruins\u201d.\n\nSwami Vivekananda described the condition of the Indians then, in the following words: \u201cMoving about here and there emaciated figures of young and old in tattered rags, whose faces bear deep-cut lines of the despair and poverty of hundreds of years; cows, bullocks, buffaloes common everywhere \u2013 aye, the same melancholy look in their eyes, the same feeble physique, on the wayside, refuse and dirt; \u2013 this is our present-day India.\u201d\n\nFilled with the desire to adapt their society to the requirements of the modem world of science, democracy and nationalism, social leaders then set out to reform their traditional religions. This was because religion in those times was a basic part of people\u2019s life and there could be little social reform without religious reform.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso read: Basavanna: Renowned Social Reformer\n\nTable of Contents\n\nClassification of Social and Religious Movements which reformed India\nThe Hindu Reform Movements\nHindu Reform Movements in Eastern India (Bengal)\n(1) Brahmo Samaj by Raja Ramohun Roy\n(2) Tattvabodhini Sabha and Adi Brahmo Samaj by Debendranath Tagore\n(3) Brahmo Samaj of India by Keshab Chandra Sen\n(4) Young Bengal Movement by Henry Derozio\n(5) Ramakrishna Movement by Swami Vivekananda\nHindu Reform Movements in Western India (Maharashtra)\n(1) Prarthana Samaj by Dadoba Pandurang and Atmaram Pandurang\n(2) Arya Samaj by Swami Dayanand Dayanand Saraswati\nHindu Reform Movements in South India (Maharashtra)\nThe Theosophical Society by Madam H.P.

They actively opposed the caste system and child marriage and supported the general uplift of women, including widow remarriage, and the spread of modem education to men and women.\nThe Brahmo tradition of Raja Rammohun Roy was carried forward after 1843 by Devendranath Tagore and after 1866 by Keshub Chandra Sen.\n(2) TATTVABODHINI SABHA AND ADI BRAHMO SAMAJ BY DEBENDRANATH TAGORE\nDebendranath Tagore, father of Rabindranath Tagore formed Tattvabodhini Sabha in 1839.\nHe later gave a new life to Brahmo Samaj when he joined it in 1842.\nHe devoted himself to the systematic study of India\u2019s past with a rational outlook.\nHe propagated Roy\u2019s ideas.\n(3) BRAHMO SAMAJ OF INDIA BY KESHAB CHANDRA SEN\nKeshab Chandra Sen joined Brahmo Samaj in 1858 and was made acharya by Debendranath Tagore.\nHe was instrumental in popularising Brahmo Samaj outside Bengal in the United Provinces, Punjab, Bombay and Madras.\nIn 1863, Keshab was instrumental in the formation of Prarthana Samaj in Bombay which relied on education and persuasion and not on direct confrontation with Hindu Orthodoxy.\nKeshab Sen was a strong believer in religious universalism. He often stated that \u201cOur position is not that truths are to be found in all religious, but that all established religions of the world are true\u201d.\nHis radicalism brought him into opposition with Debendranath. In 1866, the Samaj was formally divided into Adi Brahmo Samaj (headed by Debendranath Tagore) and the Brahmo Samaj of India (headed by Keshab Chandra Sen)\nIn 1873 due to the inexplicable act of getting his own 13-year-old daughter married by following all Orthodox Hindurituals, Brahmo Samaj of India was again split.\n(4) YOUNG BENGAL MOVEMENT BY HENRY DEROZIO\nHenry taught at Hindu College from 1826-31.\nInspired by French Revolution, he taught his pupils to think freely, rationally and question all authority.\n(5) RAMAKRISHNA MOVEMENT BY SWAMI VIVEKANANDA\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa (1834-86) was a saintly person who sought religious salvation in the traditional ways of renunciation, meditation and devotion (bhakti).\nHe emphasised that there were many roads to God and salvation and that service of man was service of God, for man was the embodiment of God.\nSwami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was his disciple.\nVivekanda popularised Ramakrishna\u2019s religious messages. He tried to put it in a form that would suit the needs of contemporary Indian society.\nVivekanda wrote in 1898; \u201cFor our own motherland a junction of the two great systems, Hinduism and Islam\u2026 is the only hope\u201d.\nAt the same time, he was convinced of the superior approach of the Indian philosophical tradition. He himself subscribed to Vedanta which he declared to be a fully rational system.\nVivekananda criticised Indians for having lost touch with the rest of the world and became stagnant and mummified.\nVivekananda condemned the caste system and the Hindu emphasis on rituals and superstitions.\nHe urged people to imbibe the spirit of liberty, equality and free-thinking.\nVivekananda was a great humanist. Shocked by the poverty, misery and suffering of the common people of the country, he wrote: \u201cThe only God in whom I believe, the sum total of all souls, and above all, my God the wicked, my God the afflicted, my God the poor of all races\u201d\nTo the educated Indians, he said: So long as the millions live in hunger and ignorance, I hold every man a traitor, who having been educated at their expense, pays not the least heed to them\u201d\nIn 1897, Vivekananda founded Ramakrishna Mission to carry on humanitarian relief and social work. It thus laid emphasis on social good or social service.\nHindu Reform Movements in Western India (Maharashtra)\n\nReligious reforms started in Bombay in 1840 by the Parmahans Mandali which aimed at fighting idolatry and the caste system. Perhaps the earliest religious reformer in western India was Gopal Hari Deshmukh, known popularly as \u2018Lokahitwadi\u2019, who wrote in Marathi. He made powerful rationalist attacks on Hindu orthodoxy and preached religious and social equality.\n\n(1) PRARTHANA SAMAJ BY DADOBA PANDURANG AND ATMARAM PANDURANG\n\nPrarthana Samaj or \u201cPrayer Society\u201d in Sanskrit, was a movement for religious and social reform in Bombay, India, based on earlier reform movements.\n\nPrarthana Samaj was founded by the Dadoba Pandurang and his brother Atmaram Pandurang in 1863 when Keshub Chandra Sen visited Maharashtra, with an aim to make people believe in one God and worship only one God.\n\nIt became popular after Mahadev Govind Ranade joined. Two of its great leaders were G Bhandarkar, the famous Sanskrit scholar and historian, and Mahadev Govind Ranade (1842-1901).\n\nThe main reformers were the intellectuals who advocated reforms of the social system of the Hindus in the light of modern knowledge.\n\nIt was spread to southern India by noted Telugu reformer and writer, Kandukuri Veeresalingam.\n\nOne of the greatest rationalist thinkers of modem India, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, also lived and worked in Maharashtra at this time.\n\n(2) ARYA SAMAJ BY SWAMI DAYANAND DAYANAND SARASWATI\nThe Arya Samaj undertook the task of reforming the Hindu religion in the west and north India.\nIt was founded in 1875 by Swami Dayanand Saraswati (1824-83).\nSwami Dayanand believed that selfish and ignorant priests had perverted Hindu religion with the aid of the Puranas which, he said, were full of false teachings.\nFor his own inspiration, Swami Dayanand went to the Vedas which he considered infallible, being the inspired word of God, and as the fountain of all knowledge.\nSome of Swami Dayanand\u2019s followers later started a network of school and colleges in the country to impart education on western lines. Lala Hansraj played a leading part in this effort.\nIn 1902, Swami Shradhananda started the Gurukul near Hardwar to propagate the more traditional ideals of education.\nOne of Arya Samaj\u2019s objectives was to prevent the conversion of Hindus to other religions. This led it to start a crusade against other religions. This crusade became a contributory factor in the growth of communalism in India in the 20th century.\nHindu Reform Movements in South India (Maharashtra)\n\nThe Theosophical Society was a major Hindu Reform movement with roots in Maharashtra.\n\nTHE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY BY MADAM H.P. BLAVATSKY AND COLONEL S. OLCOTT\nThe Theosophical Society was founded in the United States by Madam H.P. Blavatsky and Colonel S. Olcott, who later came to India and founded the headquarters of the Society at Adyar near Madras in 1886.\nThe Theosophist movement soon grew in India as a result of the leadership given to it by Mrs Annie Besant who had come to India in 1893.\nThe Theosophists advocated the revival and strengthening of the ancient religions of Hinduism, Zoroastrianism and Buddhism. They recognised the doctrine of the transmigration of the soul.\nOne of Mrs. Besant\u2019s many achievements in India was the establishment of the Central Hindu School at Banaras which was later developed by Madan Mohan Malaviya into the Benaras Hindu University.\nReligious reforms among Muslims\n\nThere were many prominent leaders like Sayyid Ahmed Khan and Muhammad Iqbal who influenced the Muslim population in India.\n\nSayyid Ahmad Khan and the Aligarh School\nThe most important reformer among the Muslims was Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817-98).\nIn his view, any interpretation of the Quran that conflicted with human reason, science, or nature was in reality a misinterpretation.\nAll his life he struggled against blind obedience to tradition, dependence on custom, ignorance and irrationalism.\nSayyid Ahmad Khan believed that the religious and social life of the Muslims could be improved only by imbibing modem western scientific knowledge and culture. Therefore promotion of modem education remained his priority throughout his life.\nIn 1875 he founded at Aligarh the Muhammedan Anglo-Oriental College as a centre for spreading western sciences and culture. Later, this College grew into the Aligarh Muslim University.\nSayyid Ahmad\u2019s reformist zeal also embraced the social sphere. He urged Muslims to give up medieval customs and ways of thought and behaviour.\nIn particular, he wrote in favour of raising women\u2019s status in society and advocated the removal of purdah and the spread of education among women.\nHe also condemned the customs of polygamy and easy divorce.\nHe opposed communal friction.\nAppealing to Hindus and Muslims to unite, he said in 1883, \u201cNow both of us live on the air of India, drink the holy waters of the Ganga and Yamuna. We both feed upon the products of the Indian soil.\u201d\nHowever, towards the end of his life, he began to talk of Hindu domination to prevent his followers from joining the rising national movement.\nMuhammad Iqbal (1876-1938)\nMuhammad Iqbal was one of the greatest poets of modem India.\nHe profoundly influenced the philosophical and religious outlook of the younger generation of Muslims as well as of Hindus.\nReligious Reforms among the Parsis\n\nThe prominent figures among Parsis include Naoroji Furdonji, Dadabhai Naoroji, S.S. Bengalee etc.\n\nRehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha or Religious Reform Association\n\nIn 1851, the Rehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha or Religious Reform Association was started by Naoroji Furdonji, Dadabhai Naoroji, S.S. Bengalee, and others.\n\nReligious Reforms among the Sikhs\n\nReligious reforms among the Sikhs started at the end of the 19th century when the Khalsa College was started at Amritsar. But the efforts gained momentum after 1920 when the Akali Movement arose in Punjab.\n\nAKALI MOVEMENT (PUNJAB)\nThe main aim of the Akalis was to purify the management of the gurudwaras or Sikh shrines. These gurudwaras had been heavily endowed with land and money by devout Sikhs.\nThe Sikh masses led by the Akalis started a powerful satyagraha against the mahants and the Government which aided them (1921).\nSocial reform movements to uplift women and backward castes\n\nThe major effect of national awakening in the 19th century was seen in the field of social reform. The newly educated persons increasingly revolted against rigid social conventions and outdated customs.\n\nIn the 20th century, and especially after 1919, the national movement became the main propagator of social reform.\n\nIncreasingly, the reformers took recourse to propaganda in the Indian language to reach the masses.\n\nThey also used novels, dramas, poetry, short stories, the Press and, in the thirties, the cinema to spread their views.\n\nThe social reform movements tried in the main to achieve two objectives (1) emancipation of women and extension of equal rights to them and (2) removal of caste rigidities and in particular the abolition of untouchability.\n\nMovements to uplift Women\n\nEmancipation means being free from restraint, control, or the power of another.\n\nIt is true that occasionally women of the character and personality of Razia Sultana, Chand Bibi, or Ahilyabai Holkar arose in India. But they were exceptions to the general pattern, and do not in any way change the picture.\n\nAfter the 1880s, when Dufferin hospitals (named after Lady Dufferin, the wife of the Viceroy) were started, efforts were made to make modern medicine and child delivery techniques available to Indian women.\n\nWomen played an active and important role in the struggle for freedom.\n\nThey participated in large numbers in the agitation against the partition of Bengal and in the Home Rule movement.\n\nSarojini Naidu, the famous poetess, became the president of the National Congress. Several women became ministers or parliamentary secretaries in the popular ministries of 1937.\n\nThey started many organisations and institutions for this purpose, the most outstanding of which was the All India Women\u2019s Conference founded in 1927.\n\nThe Hindu Succession Act of 1956 made the daughter an equal co-heir with the son.\n\nThe Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 permitted the dissolution of marriage on specific grounds.\n\nMovements to uplift Backward Caste\n\nThe caste system was another major target of attack for the social reform movement. The Hindus were at this time divided into numerous castes.\n\nThe untouchables suffered from numerous and severe disabilities and restrictions. He could not enter the Hindu temples or study the shastras. In some parts of the country, particularly in the south, their very shadow was to be avoided.\n\nAn untouchable\u2019s dress, food, place of residence, all were carefully regulated. He could not draw water from wells and tanks used by the higher castes; he could do so only from wells and tanks specially reserved for untouchables.\n\nIn modern India, it became a major obstacle to the growth of a united-nation-feeling and the spread of democracy.\n\nHowever, the British rule had many elements which gradually undermined the caste system.\n\nThe urbanisation and the introduction of modem industries, railways and buses made it difficult to prevent mass contact among persons of different castes, especially in the cities. Modem commerce and industry opened new fields of economic activity to all.\n\nThe growth of the national movement too played a significant role in weakening the caste system.\n\nLeaders like Gandhi kept the abolition of untouchability at the forefront of all public activities.\n\nIn 1932, Gandhiji founded the All India Harijan Sangh for the purpose. His campaign for the \u201croot and branch removal of untouchability\u201d was based on the grounds of humanism and reason.\n\nIn Maharashtra, Jyotiba Phule led a lifelong movement against Brahmanical religious authority as part of his struggle against upper caste domination.\n\nB.R. Ambedkar, who belonged to one of the scheduled castes, devoted his entire life to fighting against caste tyranny,\n\nHe organised the All India Scheduled Castes Federation for the purpose. Several other scheduled caste leaders founded the All India Depressed Classes Association.\n\nIn Kerala, Sri Narayan Guru organised a lifelong struggle against the caste system.\n\nThe Indian Constitution, in 1950, provided the legal framework for the final abolition of untouchability.\n\nRead:\u00a0Vaikom satyagraha\n\nThe Impact of Socio-Religious Movements on Indians\n\nThere were positive and negative impacts of the socio-religious movements in India.\n\nThe positive aspects of the socio-religious movements in India\n\nThe religious reform movements of modem times had an underlying unity. Most of them were based on the twin doctrines of Reason (Rationalism) and Humanism, though they also sometimes tended to appeal to faith and ancient authority to bolster their appeal.\n\nThey opposed the ritualistic, superstitious, irrational and obscurantist elements in Indian religion.\n\nSwami Vivekananda once said: \u201cIs religion to justify itself by the discoveries of reason through which every science justifies itself\u201d\n\nJustice Ranade came to the conclusion that society as a living organism is constantly changing and can never go back to the past.\n\nThe best of reformers argued that modem ideas and culture could be best imbibed by integrating them into Indian cultural streams.\n\nThe religious reform movements helped many Indians to come to terms with the modem world. These movements led to the emergence of Indian nationalism and eventually the freedom struggle.\n\nThe negative aspects of the socio-religious movements in India\n\nTwo negative aspects of the religious reform movements may also be noted.\n\n(1) Firstly, all of them catered to the needs of a small percentage of the population-the urban middle and upper classes.\n\n(2) The second limitation, which later became a major negative factor, was the tendency to look backwards, appeal to past greatness, and rely on scriptural authority. Appeals to past greatness created false pride and smugness, while the habit of finding a \u2018Golden Age\u2019 in the past acted as a check on the full acceptance of modem science and hampered the effort to improve the present.\n\nThe evil aspects of this phenomenon became apparent when it was found that, along with a rapid rise of national consciousness, another consciousness \u2013 communal consciousness \u2013 had begun to rise among the middle classes.\n\nMany other factors were certainly responsible for the birth of communalism in modem times; but undoubtedly, the nature of the religious reform movements also contributed to it.\n\nLearn more\n\nThis article is the 5th part of the article series on Modern Indian History.

A sense of oneness has been there for ages \u2013 even though most of the centralised administration in India didn\u2019t last long.\n\nWith the end of Mughal rule, India broke into hundreds of princely states.\u00a0 The British \u2013 which were instrumental in the fall of the Mughal Empire \u2013 held control over the princely states and created the British Indian Empire.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHowever, most Indians were extremely dissatisfied with the exploitative foreign rule.\n\nThe educated Indians realised that the British always gave priority to their colonial interests and treated India only as a market.\n\nThey advocated for the political independence of India.\n\nFoundation of Indian National Congress (INC) in 1885\n\nThe late nineteenth century witnessed the emergence of many political organisations in British India.\n\nIndian National Congress (also known as Congress Party) founded in 1885 was the most prominent one.\n\nInitially, its aim was to create a platform for civic and political dialogue between Indians and the British Raj and thus obtain a greater share of government for educated Indians.\n\nLater, under the leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawarhal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Sardar Vallabhai Patel, the Congress party played a central role in organising mass movements against the British.\n\nPartition of Bengal (1905)\n\nIndian nationalism was gaining in strength and Bengal was the nerve centre of Indian nationalism in the early 1900s.\n\nLord Curzon, the Viceroy (1899-1905), attempted to \u2018dethrone Calcutta\u2019 from its position as the centre from which the Congress Party manipulated throughout Bengal, and indeed, the whole of India.\n\nThe decision to partition Bengal into two was in the air from December 1903.\n\nCongress party \u2013 from 1903 to mid-1905 \u2013 tried moderate techniques of petitions, memoranda, speeches, public meetings and press campaigns. The objective was to turn to public opinion in India and England against the partition.\n\nHowever, Viceroy Curzon 1905 formally announced the British Government\u2019s decision for the partition of Bengal on 19 July 1905. The partition took effect on 16 October 1905.\n\nThe partition was meant to foster another kind of division \u2013 on the basis of religion. The aim was to place Muslim communalists as a counter to the Congress. Curzon promised to make Dacca the new capital.\n\nThis resulted in a lot of discontent among the Indians. Many considered this as a policy of \u2018Divide and Rule\u2019 by the British.\n\nThis triggered a self-sufficiency movement popularly known as the Swadeshi movement.\n\nAlso read: Dr. Rajendra Prasad: Architect of the Indian Republic\n\nThe Swadeshi Movement (1905-1908)\n\nFrom conservative moderation to political extremism, from terrorism to incipient socialism, from petitioning and public speeches to passive resistance and boycott, all had their origins in the movement.\n\nSwadeshi is a conjunction of two Sanskrit words: swa (\u201cself\u201d) and desh (\u201ccountry\u201d).\n\nThe movement popularised the use and consumption of indigenous products. Indians started ditching British goods for Indian products.\n\nWomen, students, and a large section of the urban and rural population of Bengal and other parts of India became actively involved in politics for the first time with Swadeshi Movement.\n\nThe message of Swadeshi and the boycott of foreign goods soon spread to the rest of the country.\n\nThe militant nationalists led by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Lajpat Rai and Aurobindo Ghosh were in favour of extending the movement to the rest of India and carrying it beyond the programme of just Swadeshi and boycott to a full-fledged political mass struggle. For them, the aim was Swaraj.\n\nIn 1906, the Indian National Congress at its Calcutta Session presided over by Dadabhai Naoroji, declared that the goal of the Indian National Congress was \u2018self-government or Swaraj like that of the United Kingdom or the Colonies.\n\nThere were differences in the ideologies of the congressmen who were popularly known by the names Moderates and the Extremists. They had differences of opinion regarding the pace of the movement and the techniques of struggle to be adopted. This came to a head in the 1907 Surat session of the Congress where the party split (the two factions re-joined later).\n\nThis period also saw a breakthrough in Indian art, literature, music, science and industry.\n\nIt was, perhaps, in the cultural sphere that the impact of the Swadeshi Movement was most marked. The songs composed at that time by Rabindranath Tagore, Rajani Kanta Sen etc became the moving spirit for nationalists of all hues.\n\nIn art, this was the period when Abanindranath Tagore broke the domination of Victorian naturalism over Indian art and sought inspiration from the rich indigenous traditions of Mughal, Rajput and Ajanta paintings.\n\nIn science, Jagdish Chandra Bose, Prafulla Chandra Ray, and others pioneered original research that was praised the world over.\n\nThe Swadeshi period also saw the creative use of traditional popular festivals and melas as a means of reaching out to the masses. The Ganapati and Shivaji festivals, popularized by Tilak, became a medium for Swadeshi propaganda not only in Western India but also in Bengal.\n\nAnother important aspect of the Swadeshi Movement was the great emphasis given to self-reliance or \u2018Atmasakti\u2019in various fields meant the re-asserting of national dignity, honour and confidence.\n\nSelf-reliance also meant an effort to set up Swadeshi or indigenous enterprises. The period saw a mushrooming of Swadeshi textile mills, soap and match factories etc.\n\nOne of the major features of the programme of self-reliance was Swadeshi or National Education. In 1906, the National Council of Education was established. The vernacular medium was given stress from the primary to university level.\n\nCorps of volunteers (or samitis as they were called) were another major form of mass mobilization widely used by the Swadeshi Movement. The Swadesh Bandhab Samiti set up by Ashwini Kumar Dutt was the most well-known volunteer organization of them all.\n\nReasons for the failure of the Swadeshi Movement\nThe main drawback of the Swadeshi Movement was that it was not able to garner the support of the mass. The British use of communalism to turn the Muslims against the Swadeshi Movement was to a large extent responsible for this.\nDuring the Swadeshi phase, the peasantry was not organized around peasant demands. The movement was able to mobilize the peasantry only in a limited way.\nBy mid-1908 repression took the form of controls and bans on public meetings, processions and the press.\nThe internal squabbles, and especially, the split in the Congress (1907), the apex all-India organization, weakened the movement.\nThe Swadeshi Movement lacked an effective organization and party structure.\nLastly, the movement declined because of the very logic of mass movements itself \u2014 they cannot be sustained endlessly.\n\nHowever, the movement made a major contribution in taking the idea of nationalism, in a truly creative fashion, to many sections of the people. The peasant participation in the Swadeshi Movement even though less, marked the very beginnings of modern mass politics in India.\n\nAlso read: Ghadar Party\n\nThe Split in the Congress (1907)\n\nThe main public leaders of the two wings, Tilak (of the Extremists) and Gokhale (of the Moderates) were aware of the dangers of disunity in the nationalist ranks.\n\nA split was avoided in 1906 by choosing Dadabhai Naoroji as president of INC in the Calcutta session. Also, four compromise resolutions on the Swadeshi, Boycott, National Education, and Self-Government demands were passed. However, the hope of a united Congress was short-lived.\n\nThe Extremists wanted to extend the Swadeshi and the Boycott Movement from Bengal to the rest of the country but the Moderators opposed it.\n\nThe Extremists were fumed by the rumours that the Moderates wanted to scuttle the four Calcutta resolutions. This created friction among them which led to the split at the Congress session was held on 26 December 1907 at Surat, on the banks of the river Tapti.\n\nThe Indian National Congress split in December 1907. By 1907, the Moderate nationalists had exhausted their historical role. They failed to meet the demands of the new stage of the national movement and even failed to attract the younger generation.\n\nAlmost at the same time, revolutionary terrorism made its appearance in Bengal.\n\nBritain\u2019s policy towards\u00a0 INC\nThe British had been suspicious of the National Congress from its inception but they were not overtly hostile either.\nIn 1888 Viceroy Dufferin ridiculed INC as representing only the elite \u2014 \u2018a microscopic minority\u2019.\nLord Curzon said: \u201cThe Congress is tottering to its fall, and one of my greatest ambitions while in India is to assist it to a peaceful demise.\u201d\nThe intimidating policies of the British towards INC changed once the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement began. The strengthening of the militant nationalist trend alarmed the British.\nA new policy, known as the policy of the carrot and the stick was invoked. It was three-pronged. It was described as a policy of repression-conciliation-suppression.\nThe Extremists were repressed, though mildly in the first stage. The purpose is to frighten the Moderates. The British also tried to pacify Moderates through some concessions and promises if they disassociated themselves from the Extremists. However, the British always wanted to suppress Extremists.\nMinto-Morley constitutional reforms (1909)\n\nThe Government of India which was headed by Lord Minto as Viceroy and John Morley as the Secretary of State offered fresh reforms in the Legislative Councils. They began discussions with Moderates within Indian National Congress regarding this. However,\u00a0when the decision was taken, not just Moderates but the country as a whole were disappointed.\n\nMajor Provisions:\n\nThe Indian Councils Act of 1909 increased the number of elected members (but most of them were still indirectly elected) in the Imperial Legislative Council and the provincial legislative councils.\nAn Indian was to be appointed a member of the Governor-General\u2019s Executive Council.\nThe Act permitted members to introduce resolutions; it also increased their power to ask questions.\nVoting on separate budget items was allowed.\n\nThe real purpose of the Morley-Minto Reforms was to divide the nationalist ranks and encourage the growth of Muslim communalism. For the latter, they introduced the system of separate electorates under which Muslims could only vote for Muslim candidates in constituencies specially reserved for them.\n\nThe Ghadar Movement (1914)\n\nThe outbreak of the First World War in 1914 gave impetus to the nationalist feelings of Indians. The Home Rule League by Lokmanya Tilak and Annie Besant were formed during First World War.\n\nAt the same time, a revolutionary movement gained popularity \u2013 The Ghadar Movement. (Note: The word Ghadar means \u2018revolt\u2019)\n\nThe Ghadar Movement was an international political movement founded by expatriate Indians to overthrow British rule in India.\n\nThe early membership was composed mostly of Punjabi Indians who lived and worked on the West Coast of the United States and Canada. The movement later spread to India and Indian diasporic communities around the world.\n\nThe main leader initially was Bhagwan Singh, a Sikh priest who had worked in Hong Kong and the Malay States.\n\nLater Har Dayal took leadership and played a crucial role in the Ghadar movement. He issued a Yugantar Circular praising the attack on the Viceroy. He urged Indians in the USA not to fight against the US but use their freedom in the US to fight the British.\n\nThe Ghadar militants toured extensively, visiting mills and farms where most of the Punjabi immigrant labour worked. The Yugantar Ashram became the home and headquarters and refuge of these political workers.\n\nKomagatamaru Incident\nThe Komagata Maru incident involved the Japanese steamship Komagata Maru, on which a group of people from British India attempted to immigrate to Canada in April 1914. Most of the ship passengers were denied entry and forced to return to Calcutta (present-day Kolkata). There, the Indian Imperial Police attempted to arrest the group leaders. A riot ensued, and they were fired upon by the police, resulting in the deaths of 22 people.\nBritish Government passed orders that no passenger be allowed to disembark anywhere on the way \u2014 not even at the places from where they had joined the ship \u2014 but only at Calcutta.\nIt triggered off a wave of resentment and anger among the Indian community and became the occasion for anti-British mobilization.\nA number of Ghadar leaders, like Barkatullah and Tarak Nath Das, used the inflammatory passions surrounding the\u00a0Komagata Maru incident as a rallying point and successfully brought many disaffected Indians in North America into the party\u2019s fold.\nGhadar\u2019s weakness\nGhadar leaders completely underestimated the extent of preparation needed at every level \u2014 organizational, ideological, strategic, tactical, and financial \u2014 that was necessary before an armed revolt could be organized.\nAn almost non-existent organizational structure; the Ghadar Movement was sustained more by the enthusiasm of the militants than by their effective organization.\nThe movement failed to generate an effective and sustained leadership that was capable of integrating the various aspects of the movement. Har Dayal\u2019s ideas did not form a structured vision but remained a shifting amalgam of various theories that attracted him from time to time.\nLacking a mass base, despite the remarkable heroism of the individual revolutionaries who operated in small secret groups, the movement could not withstand suppression by the strong colonial state.\nThe Ghadar Movement came to an abrupt end with the arrest of Har Dayal.\nThe Home Rule Movement (1916-1918)\n\nThe Home Rule Movement under the leadership of Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak was an important political movement that set the stage for India\u2019s struggle for independence.\n\nAnnie Besant, who was a proponent of Free Thought, Radicalism, Fabianism and Theosophy, had come to India in 1893 to work for the Theosophical Society.\n\nIn 1914, she decided to enlarge the sphere of her activities. She started a movement for Home Rule on the lines of the Irish Home Rule League.\n\nShe realized that she needs the cooperation of both Moderates and Extremists. In the annual session of the Congress 1915, it was decided that the Extremists be allowed to rejoin the Congress along with the Moderates.\n\nTilak set up the Home Rule League in the Bombay Province.\n\nThe two leagues worked in different areas.\n\nTilak promoted the Home Rule campaign which linked the question of Swaraj with the demand for the formation of linguistic states and education in the vernacular medium.\n\nMembers of Gokhale\u2019s Servants of India Society, though not permitted to become members of the League, encouraged the demand for Home Rule by undertaking lecture tours and publishing pamphlets.\n\nDuring the Lucknow session of the Congress in December 1916, the famous Congress-League Pact was declared. Both Tilak and Annie Besant had played a role in bringing about this agreement between the Congress and the League, much against the wishes of many important leaders, including Madan Mohan Malaviya. This pact is popularly known as the Lucknow Pact where separate electorates for Muslims were accepted.\n\nThe turning point in the home rule movement came with the decision of the Government of Madras in 1917 to place Mrs Besant and her associates, B.P. Wadia and George Arundale, under arrest.\n\nMontague Declaration was introduced by the British government as a sign of a conciliatory effort. Henceforth, Home Rule or self-government movement was not treated as a seditious activity. However, this did not mean that the British were ready to grant self-government.\n\nIn 1920 All India Home Rule League changed its name to Swarajya Sabha.\n\nThe main achievement of the Home Rule Movement was that it created a generation of ardent nationalists who formed the backbone of the national movement. In the later years, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian freedom struggle entered its truly mass phase.\n\nChamparan movement in Bihar (1917)\n\nMahatma Gandhi, after his struggle against apartheid in South Africa (racial discrimination against blacks) for almost twenty years, returned to India in 1915.\u00a0 On Gokhale\u2019s advice, he spent a year travelling around British India to understand the problems of Indians.\n\nHe initially maintained a distance from political affairs, including the Home Rule Movement that was gathering momentum at this time.\n\nMahatma Gandhi began his experiments with Satyagraha against the oppressive European indigo planters at Champaran in Bihar in 1917.\n\nChamparan issue had actually begun in the early 19th century when European planters made agreements with Indian farmers that forced them to cultivate indigo on the 3/20th of their holdings (known as the Tinkathia system).\n\nResistance kept surfacing within planters and cultivators, because of the exploitation measures adopted by the British behind the indigo cultivation.\n\nIn 1908 Raj Kumar Shukla, a local man persuaded Gandhiji to come to Champaran to investigate the problem. Gandhi reached Champaran but faced resistance from the Commissioner who ordered him to immediately leave the district. Gandhiji refused. He preferred to take the punishment for his defiance of the law. This step was unusual because even Home Rule leaders used to obey the Government.\n\nThe British Indian government didn\u2019t want to create a controversy and ordered the local Government to retreat. They allowed Gandhiji to proceed with his enquiry and even nominated him as one of the enquiry members of the Government.\n\nMeanwhile, Gandhiji started investigating the grievances of peasants along with Brij Kishore, Rajendra Prasad and other members of the Bihar intelligentsia. J.B. Kripalani toured the villages and recorded the statements of peasants.\n\nGandhiji had little difficulty in convincing the Commission that the Tinkathia system needed to be abolished and that the peasants should be compensated for the illegal enhancement of their dues. The Commission founder planters guilty of exploitation.\n\nThe commission of enquiry decided to make refunds to the peasants. Gandhi asked for 50%. But the representative of planters offered to refund to the extent of 25%. In order to break the deadlock, Gandhiji agreed to a 25 per cent refund to the farmers. For Gandhi, it was not the money but the principles that were of utmost importance. In his belief, the submission of British landlords was more significant than the percentage of refunds.\n\nAhmedabad Satyagraha in Gujarat (1918)\n\nIn Ahmedabad, a dispute was brewing between workers and mill owners over the question of a \u2018plague bonus\u2019.\n\nThe employers wanted to withdraw the bonus once the epidemic had passed but the workers insisted it stay.\n\nThe British Collector asked Gandhiji to work out a compromise. Gandhiji persuaded the mill owners and the workers to agree to arbitration.\n\nThe workers demanded a 50% wage hike while the mill owners\u00a0offered only a twenty per cent wage hike. They threatened to dismiss all workers who did not accept it.\n\nGandhiji advised the workers to go on strike. He himself started fasting for workers.\n\nGandhiji was peculiar in that workers should get at least a thirty-five per cent increase in wages.\n\nFinally, the strike was withdrawn after mill owners agreed to a thirty-five per cent increase the workers had demanded.\n\nAnasuya Behn was one of the main lieutenants of Gandhiji in this struggle.\n\nKheda Satyagraha in Gujarat (1918)\n\nThe Kheda district of Gujarat was on the verge of famine owing to the failure of the crops.\n\nThe yield had been so low that the cultivators were unable to pay the revenue. But the government insisted that the cultivators should pay the tax.\n\nGandhi saw the justice of the cause of the cultivators. Enquiries by members of the Servants of India Society and Vithalbhai Patel too confirmed the genuineness of the peasants\u2019 case.\n\nGandhiji advised the withholding of tax payments, and asked the peasants to \u2018fight unto death against such a spirit of vindictiveness and tyranny\u2019.\n\nThe peasants of Kheda, already deprived because of plague, high prices and drought, were showing signs of weakness when Gandhiji came to know that the Government had issued secret instructions directing that revenue should be recovered only from those peasants who could pay.\n\nThe Government said that if well-to-do cultivators paid up the poorer section would be granted suspension. This was agreed to and the campaign ended.\n\nThe Kheda Satyagraha marked the beginning of an awakening among the peasants of Gujarat, the beginning of their true political education. In addition, it gave the educated public workers the chance to establish contact with the actual life of the peasants.\n\nRowlatt Satyagraha (1919)\n\nDuring the First World War of 1914-18, the British instituted censorship of the press and permitted detention without trial.\n\nThe Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919, popularly known as the Rowlatt Act, was passed by the Imperial Legislative Council in Delhi on 18 March 1919, indefinitely extending the emergency measures of preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without trial and judicial review enacted in the Defence of India Act 1915 during the First World War.\n\nIt was enacted in light of a perceived threat from revolutionary nationalists to organisations of re-engaging in similar conspiracies as during the war which the Government felt the lapse of the Defence of India Act would enable.\n\nThis act was passed on the recommendations of the Sedition Committee chaired by Sir Sidney Rowlatt.\n\nGandhiji launched Satyagraha against the inhuman Rowlatt Act.\n\nThe protests were particularly intense in the Punjab Gandhiji was detained while proceeding there.\n\nJallianwala Bagh massacre (1919)\n\nThe passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 resulted in large-scale political unrest throughout India.\n\nA large peaceful crowd had gathered at the\u00a0Jallianwala Bagh\u00a0in\u00a0Amritsar,\u00a0Punjab\u00a0to\u00a0protest\u00a0against the\u00a0arrest\u00a0of pro-Indian independence leaders\u00a0Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew\u00a0and\u00a0Dr. Satya Pal.\n\nIn response to the public gathering, the British\u00a0Brigadier-General\u00a0R.\u00a0E.\u00a0H. Dyer\u00a0surrounded the Bagh with his soldiers.\n\nGeneral Dyer ordered his troops to open fire on the nationalist meeting killing hundreds. The brutality at Jallianwala Bagh stunned the entire nation.\n\nThis event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their previous loyalty to the British and become nationalists distrustful of British rule.\n\nNon-cooperation Movement (1920)\n\nGandhiji called for a campaign of \u201cnon-cooperation\u201d with British rule. Indians who wished colonialism to end were asked to stop attending schools, colleges, and law courts. They were asked to not pay taxes. In sum, they were asked to adhere to a \u201crenunciation of all voluntary association with the British Government\u201d.\n\nGandhiji said that if non-cooperation was effectively carried out India would win swaraj within a year.\n\nWhen Congress met for its annual session at Nagpur, C.R. Das moved the main resolution on non-cooperation. Many groups of revolutionary terrorists, especially in Bengal, also pledged support to the movement.\n\nThe goal of the Congress, by this time, changed from the attainment of self-government by constitutional means to the attainment of Swaraj by peaceful means.\n\nKhilafat Movement (1919-24)\n\nThe Khilafat movement was a political protest campaign launched by Muslims of British India to restore the caliph of the Ottoman Caliphate, who was considered the leader of the Muslims.\n\nTo further broaden the Indian freedom struggle, Gandhiji joined hands with the Khilafat Movement.\n\nThe movement collapsed by late 1922 when Turkey gained a more favourable diplomatic position and moved towards Nationalism. By 1924, Turkey abolished the role of the caliph.\n\nHowever, the tremendous participation of Muslims in the Non-Cooperation Movement and the maintenance of communal unity, despite the Malabar developments, was in itself no mean achievement.\n\nChauri Chaura incident (1922)\n\nOn 4 February 1922, at Chauri Chaura (a place in modern Uttar Pradesh), the British police opened fire at a large group of people who were participating in the Non-cooperation movement.\n\nIn retaliation, the demonstrators attacked and set fire to a police station, killing all of its occupants. The incident led to the death of three civilians and 22 policemen.\n\nMahatma Gandhi, who was strictly against violence, halted the non-cooperation movement on the national level on 12 February 1922, as a direct result of the Chauri Chaura incident.\n\nIn spite of Gandhi\u2019s decision, 19 arrested demonstrators were sentenced to death and 14 to imprisonment for life by the British colonial authorities.\n\nMotilal Nehru, C.R. Das, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Bose, and many others recorded their disagreement on Gandhiji\u2019s views.\n\nBardoli Satyagraha in Gujarat (1928)\n\nIn January 1926, the officer charged with the duty of reassessment of the land revenue demand of the taluq had recommended a 30% increase over the existing assessment.\n\nThe Congress leaders were quick to protest against the increase and set up the Bardoli Inquiry Committee to go into the issue.\n\nIn July 1927, the Government reduced the enhancement to 21.97 per cent. But the concessions were too meagre and came too late to satisfy anybody.\n\nThe constitutionalist leaders now began to advise the peasants to resist by paying only the current amount and withholding the enhanced amount.\n\nGradually as the limitations of constitutional leadership became more apparent, Vallabhbhai Patel was invited to lead the campaign.\n\nThe government ignored Vallabhai\u2019s request which resulted in the start of Bardoli Satyagraha.\n\nThe no-tax movement was launched in Bardoli taluq of Surat district in Gujarat in 1928.\n\nThe main mobilization was done through extensive propaganda via meetings, speeches, pamphlets, and door-to-door persuasion. Special emphasis was placed on the mobilization of women and many women activists were recruited for the purpose.\n\nMembers of the Bombay Legislative Council like K.M. Munshi and Lalji Naranji, the representatives of the Indian Merchants Chamber, resigned their seats.\n\nThe government was forced to conduct an inquiry. The inquiry was done by a judicial officer, Broomfield, and a revenue officer, Maxwell. They came to the conclusion that the increase had been unjustified. The government later reduced the enhancement to 6.03 per cent.\n\nThe boycott of the Simon Commission (1927)\n\nOn 8 November 1927, an all-white, Simon Commission was appointed to recommend whether India was ready for further constitutional reforms.\n\nIndian National Congress boycott Simon Commission because no Indian was present in the commission. There were protests in many places.\n\nIn Lahore, Lala Lajpat Rai, the hero of the extremist days and the most revered leader of Punjab was hit. He succumbed to the injuries in November 1928.\n\nBhagat Singh and his comrades sought to avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai. They killed the white police official, Saunders, in December 1928.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Bose emerged as the leaders during the Simon Commission boycott movement.\n\nNehru Report (1928) and the attempt to draft the Indian Constitution\n\nBritain did not acknowledge the right of Indians to frame their own constitution.\n\nBritish policy, until almost the end of the Raj, was that the timing and nature of Indian constitutional development were to be decided exclusively by the British Parliament, but it was assumed that Indians would be consulted as appropriate.\n\nIn December 1927, at its Madras session, the Indian National Congress took two major decisions in response to the setting up the Simon Commission: first, it decided to not cooperate with the Commission; second, it set up an All Parties Conference to draft a Constitution for India.\n\nThe committee of the All Parties Conference to draft the Constitution was chaired by Motilal Nehru\u00a0with his son\u00a0Jawaharlal Nehru acting as a secretary. There were nine other members in this committee.\n\nThe report submitted by the committee in 1928 was called the Nehru Report \u2013 which was actually a memorandum to appeal for dominion status and a federal set-up of government for the constitution of India.\n\nThe Nehru Report also rejected the principle of separate communal electorates on which previous constitutional reforms had been based. Seats would be reserved for Muslims at the Centre and in provinces in which they were in a minority, but not in those where they had a numerical majority.\n\nThe Nehru Report also recommended universal adult suffrage, equal rights for women, freedom to form unions, and dissociation of the state from religion in any form.\n\nHowever, Jinnah withdrew his support to the report and proposed his \u2018Fourteen Points\u2019 which were basically a reiteration of his objections to the Nehru Report.\n\nYoung and radical nationalists led by Jawaharlal Nehru had objections to the Nehru Report of Motilal Nehru. Their slogan was \u2018Complete Independence.\u2019\n\nPurna Swaraj or Complete Independence Campaign (1929)\n\nIn the Lahore session in 1929, Jawaharlal Nehru was made the President of INC. He declared \u2018Purna Swaraj\u2019 or Complete Independence as the only honourable goal Indians could strive for.\n\nOn the banks of the river Ravi, at midnight on 31 December 1929, the tricolour flag of Indian independence was hosted.\n\nThe first task that the Congress set itself in the new year was that of organizing all over the country public meetings at which the Independence Pledge would be read out and collectively affirmed on 26 January.\n\nCivil Disobedience Movement and Dandi March (1930)\n\nThe Lahore Session of Congress (1929) authorized the Working Committee to launch a programme of civil disobedience including non-payment of taxes.\n\nGandhi\u2019s ultimatum to Lord Irwin, stating the minimum demands in the form of 11 points, had been ignored, and there was now only one way out: civil disobedience. Gandhi selected salt as his main tool of disobedience.\n\nIn every Indian household, salt was indispensable; yet people were forbidden from making salt even for domestic use, compelling them to buy it from shops at a high price. The state monopoly over salt was deeply unpopular. By making salt his target, Gandhiji hoped to mobilise a wider discontent against British rule.\n\nGandhi, along with a band of seventy-eight members of the Sabarmati Ashram started to march from Ahmedabad to the coast at Dandi. There he broke the salt laws by collecting salt from the beach.\n\nOn 6 April 1930, by picking up a handful of salt, Gandhi inaugurated the Civil Disobedience Movement \u2013 a movement that was to remain unsurpassed in the history of the Indian national movement for the country-wide mass participation it unleashed.\n\nLike other parts of India, the civil disobedience movement was also launched in North-West Frontier Province (Khyber\u2013Pakhtoonkhwa). The local Congress sought help from the Khudai Khidmatgars, the most popular socio-political organization in the province.\n\nKhan Abdul Gaffar Khan\u2019s Khudai Khidmatgars, popularly known as the Red Shirts,\u00a0 played an extremely active role in the Civil Disobedience Movement.\n\nThe city came under the control of the masses for at least a week and the soldiers of the Garhwali regiment refused to fire at the unarmed crowds of Peshwar demonstrations.\n\nNehru\u2019s arrest on 14th April was followed by public protests in Madras, Calcutta and Karachi.\n\nThe Salt March was notable for at least three reasons:\n\nIt was this event that first brought Mahatma Gandhi to world attention.\nIt was the first nationalist activity in which women participated in large numbers. Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay had persuaded Gandhi for this issue.\nIt was the Salt March that forced upon the British the realisation that their Raj would not last forever, and that they would have to devolve some power to the Indians.\nGandhi-Irwin Pact (1931) and the Round Table Conferences (1930-32)\n\nBritish convened a series of \u201cRound Table Conferences\u201d in London to discuss constitutional reforms in India.\n\nThe first meeting was held in November 1930. However, without the pre-eminent political leader in India, it was an exercise in futility.\n\nGandhi was released from jail in January 1931. In the following month, he had several long meetings with the Viceroy. These culminated in what was called the \u201cGandhi-Irwin Pact\u2019.\n\nThe terms of the agreement included the immediate release of all political prisoners not convicted for violence, the remission of all fines not yet collected, the return of confiscated lands not yet sold to third parties, and lenient treatment for those government employees who had resigned. The Government also conceded the right to make salt for consumption to villages along the coast. They also gave the right to peaceful and non-aggressive picketing.\n\nThe Congress\u2019s demand for a public inquiry into police excesses was not accepted, but Gandhiji\u2019s insistent request for an inquiry was recorded in the agreement.\n\nCongress, on its part, agreed to discontinue the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM).\n\nA second Round Table Conference was held in London in the latter part of 1931. Here, Gandhiji represented the Congress. Gandhi opposed the demand for separate electorates for \u201clower castes\u201d. For him, separate electorates to the \u201cUntouchables\u201d will ensure their bondage in perpetuity. He thought this would prevent their integration into mainstream society and permanently segregate them from other caste Hindus.\n\nBut Ambedkar was in favour of separate electorates for depressed classes. He believed it is the only path for a community so handicapped to succeed in the struggle for life against the organised tyranny of higher castes.\n\nDuring the second Round Table Conference in London, Winston Churchill, leader of the right wing, strongly objected to the British Government negotiating on terms of equality with the \u2018seditious fakir\u2019. He demanded a strong government in India.\n\nThe discussions with Gandhi failed as the British Government refused to concede the basic Indian demand for freedom. Gandhiji resumed Civil Disobedience after reaching back\n\nThe government launched its strike against the national movement by arresting Gandhi. British government promulgated ordinances that gave the authorities unlimited power \u2013 the \u2018Civil Martial Law.\u2019 Civil liberties no longer existed and the authorities could seize people and property at will.\n\nIn 1934 the inevitable decision to withdraw Civil Disobedience Movement was taken by Gandhi.\n\nHowever, many political activists were not in favour of stopping the movement. They included Jawaharlal Nehru who was critical of Gandhiji\u2019s decisions regarding the timing of the withdrawal of CDM.\n\nThe support that the movement had garnered from the poor and the illiterate, both in the town and in the country, was remarkable indeed.\n\nNevertheless, the participation of Muslims in the Civil Disobedience Movement was certainly nowhere near that of the Non-cooperation movement 1920-22.\n\nFor Indian women, the movement was the most liberating experience to date and can truly be said to have marked their entry into the public space.\n\nThe Communal Award (1932)\n\nAfter the Third Round Table Conference, in November 1932, the then Prime Minister of Britain Ramsay McDonald gave an order which is known as the Communal Award.\n\nIt was part of Britain\u2019s policy of \u2018Divide and Rule.\n\nThe award granted separate electorates in British India for the Forward Caste, Lower Caste, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, Europeans and Untouchables (Dalits) etc.\n\nThe Congress Party was unhappy at the extension of communal representation but became particularly outraged at the British offer of separate-electorate seats for \u201cdepressed classes\u201d.\n\nGandhi viewed the McDonald Award as a nefarious\u00a0British plot to wean more than 50 million Hindus away from their higher-caste brothers and sisters.\n\nThe idea of a separate electorate for Muslims had been accepted by Congress as far back as 1916 as a part of the compromise with the Muslim League. Hence, Congress took the position it was opposed to separate electorates but not in favour of changing the Award without the consent of the minorities.\n\nGandhi demanded that the representatives of the Depressed Classes should be elected if possible by the universal, common franchise. At the same time, he did not object to the demand for a larger number of reserved seats for the Depressed Classes. He went on a fast unto death on 20 September 1932 to enforce his demand.\n\nIn the end, political leaders succeeded in bringing an agreement, known as the Poona Pact.\n\nIn this pact, the idea of separate electorates for the Depressed Classes was abandoned but the seats reserved for them in the provincial legislatures and Central Legislature were increased.\n\nAfter being released from prison Gandhiji shifted to Satyagraha Ashram at Wardha after abandoning Sabarmati Ashram at Ahmedabad for he had vowed in 1930 not to return to Sabarmati till Swaraj was won.\n\nGovernment of India Act (1935)\n\nThe growing demand for constitutional reforms in India led the British Parliament to enact the Government of India Act 1935.\n\nThe Act promised some form of representative government.\n\nThe Act provided the establishment of an All-India Federation based on the union of British Indian provinces and the Princely States.\n\nDefence and foreign affairs would remain outside the control of the federal legislature, while the Viceroy would retain special control over other subjects.\n\nGovernors, appointed by the British Government, retained special powers. They could veto legislative and administrative measures, especially those concerning minorities, the rights of civil servants, law and order, and British business interests.\n\nThe Governor also had the power to take over and indefinitely run the administration of a province.\n\nThe Act of 1935 was condemned and unanimously rejected by Congress. The Congress demanded the convening of a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise to frame a constitution for an independent India.\n\nResignation of Congress ministries (1939)\n\nCongress won the elections to the provincial assemblies held in February 1937. Its election manifesto reaffirmed its total rejection of the 1935 Act.\n\nOne of the first acts of the Congress Government was to release thousands of political prisoners and to cancel deportation orders on political workers.\n\nThe difference between the Congress provinces and the non-Congress provinces of Bengal and Punjab was most apparent in this realm. In the latter, especially in Bengal, civil liberties continued to be curbed and they never released prisoners.\n\nHowever, Congress could not attempt a complete overhaul of the agrarian structure by completely eliminating the Zamindari system.\n\nLater the Second World War broke out. Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru promised Congress support to the war effort if the British, in return, promised to grant India independence once hostilities ended. The offer was refused. Gandhi withdrew support to the British in War.\n\nThe Congress ministries resigned in October and November 1939, in protest against Viceroy Lord Linlithgow\u2019s action of declaring India to be belligerent in the Second World War without consulting the Indian people.\n\nThe resignations brought the Left and the Right in Congress closer because of a common policy on the question of participation in the war.\n\nCrisis at Tripuri (1939)\n\nSubhas Bose had been a unanimous choice as the President of Congress in 1938. In 1939, he decided to stand again \u2014 this time as the spokesperson of militant politics and radical groups.\n\nHowever, with the blessings of Gandhiji, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad, J.B. Kripalani other leaders put up Pattabhi Sitaramayya as a candidate for the post.\n\nBose accused Patel and other top leaders of Congress as \u2018rightists\u2019. He openly accused them of working for a compromise with the Government on the question of the federation. Bose had, therefore, appealed to Congressmen to vote for a leftist and \u2018a genuine anti-federationist.\u2019\n\nNevertheless, in reality, the difference between \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018left\u2019 was not very vivid within the Congress and most Congressmen were anti-federationist.\n\nSubhas Bose won the election on 29 January on the popularity of his militant politics but only by a narrow margin \u2013 1580 votes against 1377.\n\nBut the election of Bose brought the brewing crisis to a head at the Tripuri session of the Congress.\n\nGandhiji declared that Sitaramayya\u2019s defeat was \u2018more mine than his.\n\nBose argued in his presidential address at Tripuri for a programme of immediately giving the British Government a six-month ultimatum to grant the national demand for independence and of launch a mass civil disobedience movement if it failed to do so.\n\nSubhas Bose believed that the Congress was strong enough to bunch an immediate struggle and that the masses were ready for such a struggle.\n\nHowever, Gandhi\u2019s perceptions were very different. Gandhi believed the time was not yet ripe for an ultimatum because neither Congress nor the masses were yet ready for struggle.\n\nThe internal strife reached its climax at the Tripuri session of the Congress, held from 8 to 12 March 1939.\n\nBose had completely misjudged his support and the meaning of his majority in the presidential election. Congressmen had voted for him not because they wanted to have him as the supreme leader of the national movement \u2013 but mainly because of his policies and militant politics. They were not willing to reject Gandhi\u2019s leadership or his views.\n\nBose resigned from the presidency. This led to the election of Rajendra Prasad in his place.\n\nSubsequently, Subhas Bose and his followers formed the Forward Bloc as a new party within Congress.\n\nAs Bose planned a protest against an AICC resolution, the Working Committee removed Bose from the presidentship of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee and debarred him from holding any Congress office for three years.\n\nIndividual Satyagraha (1940)\n\nGandhiji decided to initiate a limited satyagraha on an individual basis by a few selected individuals in every locality. The demand of a satyagrahi was for the freedom of speech to preach against participation in the War.\n\nThe satyagrahi would beforehand inform the district magistrate of the time and place where he or she was going to make the anti-war speech. If the Government did not arrest a satyagrahi, he or she would not only repeat the performance but move into the villages and start a trek towards Delhi, thus participating in a movement that came to be known as the \u2018Delhi Chalo\u2019 (onwards to Delhi) movement.\n\nVinoba Bhave was to be the first satyagrahi on 17 October 1940 and Jawaharlal Nehru the second.\n\nIndividual Satyagraha served a dual purpose \u2014 (1) it gave expression to the Indian people\u2019s strong political feelings, (2) it gave the British Government another opportunity to peacefully accept the Indian demands.\n\nCripps Mission (1942)\n\nThe Cripps Mission was a failed attempt in late March 1942 by the British government to secure full Indian cooperation and support for their efforts in World War II.\n\nThe mission was headed by a senior minister Sir Stafford Cripps, traditionally sympathetic to Indian self-rule.\n\nHowever, he was also a member of the coalition War Cabinet led by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who had long been the leader of the movement to block Indian independence.\n\nChurchill was persuaded to send Sir Stafford Cripps, to India to try and forge a compromise with Gandhiji and the Congress.\n\nThe Declaration promised India Dominion Status and a constitution-making body after the War. He proposed that the Constitutional Assembly members would be elected by the provincial assemblies and nominated by the rulers in the case of the princely states.\n\nAt that time, the demand for a separate nation for Muslims \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 also got momentum.\n\nThe Pakistan demand was accommodated by the provision that any province which was not prepared to accept the new constitution would have the right to sign a separate agreement with Britain regarding its future status.\n\nTalks broke down, when, Congress objected to the provision for Dominion Status rather than full independence.\n\nCongress insisted that if it was to help the British defend India from the Axis powers, then the Viceroy had first to appoint an Indian as the Defence Member of his Executive Council.\n\nAfter the failure of the Cripps Mission, Mahatma Gandhi decided to launch the \u201cQuit India\u201d campaign also known as the \u2018August Revolution\u2019.\n\nQuit India Movement (1942)\n\nThe\u00a0Quit India Movement was\u00a0launched at the Bombay session of the\u00a0All India Congress Committee\u00a0by\u00a0Mahatma Gandhi\u00a0on 8 August 1942, during\u00a0World War II, demanding an end to\u00a0British rule in India.\n\nIn this struggle, the common people of the country demonstrated unparalleled heroism and militancy.\n\nHowever, the repression that they faced was the most brutal that had ever been used against the national movement.\n\nAt the historic August meeting at Gowalia Tank in Bombay, Gandhiji was particular about complete freedom and no more piece-meal approach from the British.\n\nHe proclaimed: \u2018Do or Die\u2019 \u2013 which meant either free India or die in the attempt.\n\nGandhi asked government servants to openly declare their allegiance to congress\u00a0and not to resign.\n\nIn the meantime, underground networks were consolidated in various parts of the country. The prominent members of underground activities were Achyut Patwardhan, Aruna Asaf Ali, Ram Manohar Lohia, and Sucheta Kripalani.\n\nThe pattern of activity of the underground movement was that of organizing the disruption of communications by blowing up bridges, cutting telegraph and telephone wires, and derailing trains.\n\nCongress Radio operated clandestinely from different locations in Bombay city, whose broadcast could be heard as far as Madras. Usha Mehta was an important member of the small group that ran the Congress Radio.\n\nA significant feature of the Quit India Movement was the emergence of what came to be known as parallel governments in some parts of the country. Satara (Maharashtra) emerged as the base of the longest-lasting and most effective parallel government.\n\nA significant feature of peasant activity was its total concentration on attacking symbols of British authority and a total lack of any incidents of anti-zamindar violence.\n\nIn February 1943, Gandhiji declared the fast in Aga Khan Palace where he was held in detention, as this was his answer to the Government which had been constantly exhorting him to condemn the violence of the people in the Quit India Movement. Gandhiji not only refused to condemn the people\u2019s resort to violence but unequivocally held the Government responsible for it.\n\nThe resignation of the three Indian members of the Viceroy\u2019s Executive Council, M.S. Aney, N.R. Sarkar and H.P. Mody, who never wished Gandhi to suffer, made a severe blow to the British.\n\nFinally, the Congress leaders were released to participate in the Simla Conference in June 1945. That marked the end of the phase of confrontation that had existed since August 1942.\n\nSimla Conference (1945) and the Wavell Plan\n\nThe Simla Conference of 1945 was a meeting between the Viceroy of India (Lord Wavell) and the major political leaders of British India at the Viceregal Lodge in Simla.\n\nWavell proposed a separate representation of Muslims within a united India. Talks, however, stalled on the issue of the selection of Muslim representatives. The All-India Muslim League claimed to be the sole representative of Indian Muslims. The Indian National Congress opposed this claim as the Congress had more Muslims in its support than the Muslim League.\n\nThis scuttled the conference, and perhaps the last viable opportunity for a united, independent India.\n\nOn 14 June 1945 Lord Wavell announced a plan for a new Executive Council in which all members except the Viceroy and the Commander in Chief would be Indians. This executive council was to be a temporary measure until a new permanent constitution could be agreed upon and come into force.\n\nRIN Mutiny (1946)\n\nThe Royal Indian Navy (RIN) revolt started in February 1946 at Mumbai when the naval ratings on HMIS Talwar protested against the poor quality of food and racial discrimination by British officers.\n\nFrom the initial flashpoint in Mumbai, the revolt spread and found support throughout\u00a0India, from\u00a0Karachi\u00a0to\u00a0Kolkata, and ultimately came to involve over 20,000 sailors in 78 ships and shore establishments.\n\nKarachi was a major centre, second only to Bombay. Sympathetic strikes took place in military establishments in Madras, Vishakhapatnam, Calcutta, Delhi, Cochin, Jamnagar, the Andamans, Bahrain and Aden.\n\nA revolt in the armed forces, even if soon suppressed, had a great liberating effect on the minds of people.\n\nThe naval mutiny proved to be the last nail in the coffin of British colonial aspirations in India.\n\nIndia was seen to be on the brink of a revolution. The mutiny witnessed the demoralization of British officials and the changing loyalties of Indian officials.\n\nHowever, communal unity evident in the RIN revolt was limited despite the Congress, League and Communist flags being jointly hoisted on the ships\u2019 masts. Muslim ratings went to the League to seek advice on future action for Pakistan.\n\nThe\u00a0Indian National Congress\u00a0and the\u00a0Muslim League\u00a0condemned the mutiny, while the\u00a0Communist Party of India\u00a0was the only party that supported the rebellion.\n\nThe mutiny was suppressed by British troops and Royal Navy warships.\n\nThe revolt was called off following a meeting between the President of the Naval Central Strike Committee (NCSC), M. S. Khan, and Sardar Vallabhai Patel who had been sent to Bombay to settle the crisis.\n\nMountbatten Plan (1947)\n\nThe legislature representatives of the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, and the Sikh community came to an agreement with Lord Mountbatten on what has come to be known as the 3 June Plan or Mountbatten Plan. This plan was the last plan for independence.\n\nThe plan announced by the Viceroy Mountbatten on 3 June 1947 included these principles:\n\nThe principle of the partition of British India was accepted by the British Government.\nSuccessor governments would be given\u00a0dominion status.\nAutonomy and sovereignty to both countries.\nThe successor governments could make their own constitution\nThe Princely States were given the right to join either Pakistan or India, based on two major factors: Geographical contiguity and the people\u2019s wishes.\n\nThe Mountbatten plan led to the enactment of the India Independence Act of 1947.\n\nIndia Independence Act (1947)\n\nThe Indian Independence Act of 1947 passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom divided British India into two new independent dominions; the Dominion of India (later to become the\u00a0Republic of India) and the\u00a0Dominion of Pakistan\u00a0(later to become the\u00a0Islamic Republic of Pakistan).\n\nThis Act received Royal Assent on 18 July 1947.\n\nIndia and Pakistan became independent on August 15th, 1947.\n\nIndia continues to celebrate August 15th as her Independence day, while Pakistan chose to celebrate August 14th as her Independence day as per their cabinet decisions.\n\nLearn more about India\u2019s Struggle for Independence\n\nHope you liked the mega article on the Indian freedom struggle.\n\nThis article on India\u2019s struggle for independence is the 6th part of the article series on Modern Indian History.

In India, Trade Unions in India are registered under the Trade Union Act (1926).\n\nTrade unions are interested in the economic and social welfare of the workers. Labor unions may also have political interests in the larger society.\n\nGrowth of labor unions in India: 6-phases\n\nThe growth of the Trade union movement in India was an organic process. It started towards the tail end of the nineteenth century and continues to date. It closely follows the development of Industry in India.\n\nIn India, now there are more than 16,000 trade unions with a collective membership of around 1 crore (10 million) laborers.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe growth of labor unions in India can be roughly classified into six phases.\n\nPre-1918: The genesis of the labor movement in India\n\nAfter the setting up of textile and jute mills coupled with the laying of railways in the 1850s, worker atrocities started to come to light.\n\nThough the origin of labor movements was traced to the 1860s, the first labor agitation in the history of India occurred in Bombay, in 1875. It was organized under the leadership of S.S Bengalee. It concentrated on the plight of workers, especially women and children. This led to the appointment of the first Factory Commission, in 1875. Consequently, the first Factories Act was passed in 1881.\n\nIn 1890, M.N Lokhande established the Bombay Mill Hands Association. This was the first organized labor union in India.\n\nFollowing this, different organizations were established across India.\n\nFeatures of the labor movements in this era:\n\nLeadership was provided by social reformers and not by the workers themselves.\nThe movements in this era mainly concentrated on the welfare of workers rather than asserting their rights.\nThey were organized, but there was no pan-India presence.\nA strong intellectual foundation or agenda was missing.\nTheir demands revolved around issues like that of women and children workers.\n1918-1924: The early trade union phase\n\nThis period marked the birth of the true trade union movement in India. It was organized along the lines of unions in the industrialized world.\n\nThe deteriorated living conditions caused by the First World War and the exposure to the outside world resulted in heightened class consciousness amongst the workers. This provided fertile ground for the development of the movement. This period is known as the early trade union period.\n\nImportant unions: Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association (1917) led by Smt. Anasuyaben Sarabhai, All India Postal and RMS Association, Madras Labour Union led by B.P Wadia etc.\n\nAITUC, the oldest trade union federation in India was set up in 1920. It was founded by Lala Lajpat Rai, and Joseph Baptista, N.M. Joshi, and Diwan Chaman Lall. Lajpat Rai was elected the first president of AITUC.\n\nFactors that influenced the growth of the movement:\n\nSpiraling prices during the War and the mass entrenchment of workers that followed it led to low living standards. Also, the wretched working conditions added to their woes. Hence, they sought collective bargaining power through unionization.\nThe development of Home Rule, the emergence of Gandhian leadership, and the socio-political conditions led to the nationalist leadership taking an interest in the worker\u2019s plight. Workers, in turn, were looking for professional leadership and guidance.\nRussian Revolution and other international developments (like the setting up of the International Labour Organisation in 1919) boosted their morale.\n1925-1934: Period of left-wing trade unionism\n\nThis era was marked by increasing militancy and a revolutionary approach. It also saw multiple split-ups in the movement. Leaders like N.M. Joshi and V.V. Giri were instrumental in moderating the movement and further integrating it with the nationalist mainstream.\n\nAITUC split up multiple times paving the way for the formation of organizations like the National Trade Union Federation (NTUF) and the All India Red Trade Union Congress (AIRTUC). However, the need for unity was felt and they all merged with the AITUC in the next phase.\n\nThe government was also receptive to the trade union movement. Legislations like the Trade Unions Act, of 1926 and the Trade Disputes Act, of 1929 gave a fillip to its growth. It bestowed many rights to the unions in return for certain obligations. This period was marked by the dominance of the left. Hence, it may be referred to as the period of left-wing trade unionism.\n\n1935-1938: The Congress interregnum\n\nThis phase was marked by greater unity between different unions. Indian National Congress was in power in most of the provinces by 1937. This led to more and more unions coming forward and getting involved with the nationalist movement. In 1935, AIRTUC merged with AITUC. Different legislations were passed by provincial governments that gave more power and recognition to the trade unions.\n\nThe approach of Congress ministries was that of promoting worker interests while protecting industrial peace. Reconciliation of labor with capital was seen as an aim, with ministries working towards securing wage rise and better living conditions. However, many ministries treated strikes as law and order issues. They used colonial machinery to suppress it. This led to considerable resentment from the unions.\n\n1939-1946: Period of labor activism\n\nThe Second World War lowered the standard of living for the workers further and this led to the strengthening of the movement. The question of the war effort created a rift between the Communists and the Congress. This, coupled with other issues, led to a further split in the movement. However, the movement as a whole got stronger due to the compounding issues. This included mass entrenchment post-war and the massive price rise that accompanied it.\n\nLegislations like the Industrial Employment Act, of 1946 and the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, of 1946 contributed to strengthening the trade union movement. In general, the movements got more vocal and involved in the national movement.\n\n1947-present: Post-independence trade unionism\n\nIt was marked by the proliferation of unions. INTUC was formed in May 1947 under the aegis of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Since then, the AITUC has come to be dominated by the Communists. Hind Mazdoor Sabha was formed in 1948 under the banner of the Praja Socialist Party. Later on, it came under the influence of Socialists. Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh was founded in 1955 and is currently affiliated with the BJP.\n\nPost-independence, trade unions became increasingly tied with party politics. The rise of regional parties has led to a proliferation in their numbers with each party opting to create its trade union. However, their influence has been somewhat reduced after the liberalization post-1991. Issues like labor code reforms and minimum wage remain a political hot potato due to the opposition from the trade union leadership.\n\nPost-independence, India has also witnessed different unions coming together to address a common issue. These include the crippling railway strike of 1974 and the Great Bombay textile strike, of 1982. However, such strikes are seen to get less public support post-1991. There is also an increased focus on informal labor. This is due to the particularly vulnerable situation of unorganized labor. All major trade unions have registered an increase in their membership from the unorganized sector.\n\nProblems faced by the Labour movement post-Independence\nUneven growth: They are concentrated in the metropolises, largely catering to the organized sector. Rural Agricultural labor and small-scale labor are grossly underrepresented.\nLow membership: Trade union membership is growing, but the vast majority of India\u2019s labor is not part of any trade unions. This reduces their collective bargaining power.\nWeak financial position: Membership fees are set too low (25 paise) by the Trade Union Act, of 1926. They are particularly disadvantaged against corporate lobbying groups that are flush with cash.\nPolitical leadership: Careerist politicians and vested political agendas mean that worker interests are sidelined. Since the leadership may not be from the labor force, they are held captive to party politics. This leads to further exploitation.\nThe multiplicity of unions: Bargaining power is diluted and it is easy for employers to divert the attention of the labor.\nInter-union rivalry: There are conflicts of interest and party politics between the unions.\nThe problem of recognition: Employers are under no obligation to give them recognition. This means that docile unions get recognition and genuine ones may be sidelined.\nDiverse nature of labor: Most unions don\u2019t have properly differentiated organizational structures to cater to different classes of labor. E.g.: Differences between agricultural, formal, and informal labor.\nLack of public support: Especially post-1991, trade unionism is looked down upon as an impediment to growth and development. This has led to a general ebbing of the movement across the country.\nMajor Labour Unions and their Political Affiliation\nAll India Trade Union Congress \u2013 Communist Party of India.\nIndian National Trade Union Congress \u2013 Indian National Congress.\nBhartiya Mazdoor Sangh \u2013 Bharatiya Janata Party.\nCentre for Indian Trade Unions \u2013 CPI(M).\nHind Mazdoor Sabha \u2013 Samajwadi Party.\nSelf-Employed Women\u2019s Association \u2013 Unaffiliated.\nThe Significance of Trade Unions in a Capitalist Society\n\nIndia\u2019s decisive shift towards market-led growth post-1991 has raised a lot of questions about the role of labor unions. Often, they are seen as an impediment to industrialization and investment. However, their role is indispensable in balancing workers\u2019 interests with those of investors. They also keep a check on the sustainability of business practices, including ethics.\n\nHence, they play an important role in getting support for worker interests from the larger society. They also mobilize opinions in favor of labor. They are also instrumental in organizing democratic protests and avoiding movements getting overly militaristic. Democratic trade unionism is also a must in avoiding workers coming under the influence of radical and anti-national elements. This is particularly important in the environment of rising socio-economic inequality post-liberalisation.\n\nEase of Doing Business vs. Competitiveness of the Labour Market\n\nThe Government of India is focused on attracting investments by making the nation business-friendly.\n\nIndia had moved 14 places to 63rd among 190 nations in the World Bank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business Rank 2020. However, it failed to achieve the government\u2019s target of being at 50th place.\n\nThe competitiveness of its labour market is a major area of worry where India is currently ranked 103 out of 141 countries by the World Economic Forum.\n\nLabour Reforms\n\nThere are numerous labor laws in India \u2013 more than 40. As part of labor reform initiatives, the labor ministry has decided to amalgamate 44 labor laws into four labor codes \u2014 on wages, industrial relations, social security and safety, health, and working conditions.\n\nThese are a slew of legislation aimed at reforming and simplifying the labor law regime in the country. According to the government, all major labor unions were consulted in the process.\n\nThe plan is to replace 44 labor laws that deal with different issues with four comprehensive bills. With this, we will have just four simplified laws in place of these laws.\n\nThe New Labour Codes \u2013 The Proposed 4 Bills\n\nThe new 4 codes will deal with wages, social security, industrial safety and welfare, and industrial relations.\n\nLabour Code on wages\n\nCode on wages will subsume legislations like The Minimum Wages Act, the Payment of Wages Act, the Payment of Bonus Act, and the Equal Remuneration Act. It aims to provide a national floor for minimum wage. It also has provisions to consider regional variations like geography, economy, etc.\n\nLabour Code on Occupational Safety, Health, and Working Conditions\n\nThe code on Industrial safety and welfare will replace legislations like the Factories Act, the Mines Act, and the Dock Workers (Safety, Health and Welfare) Act. This will put in place a uniform regime across the nation to ensure industrial safety.\n\nLabour Code on Industrial Relations\n\nThe Labour Code on Industrial Relations will combine the Trade Unions Act, of 1926, the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, of 1946, and the Industrial Disputes Act, of 1947. The focus here is to set the stage for the way labor unions can protect labor interests. It also seeks to abolish deadlocks and promote worker welfare while promoting investment.\n\nLabour Code on Social Security\n\nThe code on social security will merge important legislations like the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, the Employees\u2019 State Insurance Corporation Act, the Maternity Benefits Act, the Building and Other Construction Workers Act, and the Employees\u2019 Compensation Act\n\nNote: The Labour Code on Wages was approved by Parliament in August while the Labour Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions has been referred to the standing committee on labour.\n\nConclusion\n\nA vibrant and responsible trade union environment is the requisite for inclusive growth in any economy. It checks the growing inequality and falling living conditions of the working class.\n\nRecent years have seen an erosion of the powers of most labor unions. Though labor reforms are the need of the hour, every reform should strike a perfect balance between labor welfare and investment-led development.\n\nArticle by:\u00a0Hashin Jithu, curated by ClearIAS Team"

This was the first newspaper published in India which was later stopped because it carried critical articles against the company.\n\n1799: Governor-General Richard Wellesley enacted the\u00a0Censorship of Press Act, 1799 to stop the French from publishing anything against the British. This act brought all the newspapers under Government scrutiny before their publication. This act was later extended in 1807 and covered all kinds of Press Publications newspapers, magazines, books, and Pamphlets. The rules were relaxed in 1818 when\u00a0Francis Hastings (1813-1823) assumed office.\n\n1823: Licensing Regulation ordinance was brought out by acting Governor-General John Adams. This regulation made press without a license a penal offence. The restriction was directed mainly at Indian-language newspapers or those edited by the Indians. This caused Raja Ram Mohun Roy to repeal his Persian journal \u2018Mirat-ul-akhbar\u2019 started in 1822.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n1824: Raja Ram Mohun Roy protested against the restriction on freedom of the press.\n\n1835: Press act or Metcalfe act, repealed the Licensing regulations of 1823. Gov.Gen. Metcalfe came to be known as the \u2018liberator of the press\u2019 in India. The act required a printer/publisher to give a precise account of the premises of a publication and cease functioning if required by a similar declaration. The result of a liberal press policy was the rapid growth of newspapers.\n\n1857: Licensing act was enacted by Gov. Gen Canning (later Viceroy in 1858) after the Revolt of 1857 to impose stricter restrictions on the press. The right to stop the publication and circulation of any book, newspaper or printed matter was reserved with the Government.\n\n1867: The registration act replaced the Metcalfe act of 1835. The act was said to introduce regulations and no restrictions on the press. The print media now was made to contain the name of the printer, publisher, and place of publication and a copy had to be submitted to the government.\n\n1878: Vernacular Press act by Viceroy Lytton was enacted to curtail the freedom of Indian language newspapers (this law did not apply to English language papers). This was the result of the racial bitterness that has grown between then Indians and Europeans after the incidents of 1857.\n\nThe district magistrate was given powers to make the printer and publisher of any vernacular newspaper enter into a bond with the Government stating not to cause disaffection against the government or antipathy between persons of different religions, caste, and races through published material.\nThe printer and publisher could also be required to deposit security which could be seized if the above offences reoccurred.\nThe magistrate\u2019s action was final and no appeal could be made in a court of law.\nA vernacular newspaper could get an exemption from the operation of the Act by submitting proof to a government censor.\n\n1882: The pre-censorship of the Vernacular press act was repealed by Viceroy Ripon.\n\n1908: Newspaper (incitement to offence) Act gave the magistrates power to confiscate press property that published objectionable material likely to cause incitement to murder or acts of violence. This act was triggered by the Extremist nationalist activity during and after the Swadeshi movement of 1906.\n\n1910: Indian press act was a revision of the Vernacular Press Act that empowered the local government to demand a large amount of security at registration from the printer/publisher and forfeit/deregister of newspapers that considered anti-government, and the printer of a newspaper was required to submit two copies of each issue to local government.\n\n1921: The acts of 1908 and 1910 were repealed on the recommendation of the Press committee chaired by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru.\n\n1931: Indian Press (emergency powers) Act was enacted in the wake of the Civil disobedience movement. It gave powers to the provincial government to suppress propaganda writings in the support of Civil Disobedience movement.\n\nImportant journals or newspapers vs their authors:\nBengal gazette\u00a0 \u2013 J.A Hickey\nMaharatta (English), Kesari (Marathi) \u2013 Bal Gangadhar Tilak\nHitavada \u2013 Gopal Krishna Gokhale\nSudharak \u2013 Gopal Ganesh Agarkar\nVoice of India, Rast Goftar \u2013 Dadabai Naororji\nVande Mataram, Paridasak \u2013 Bipin Chandra Pal\nMook Nayak, Janata, Bahishkrut bharat \u2013 Dr. B.R amberdkar\nPrabuddha Bharata \u2013 Aiyasami, B.

Read here about the policies that paved way for modern education systems.\n\nThe education system that existed in ancient and medieval India was prominently that of the \u2018Gurukula\u2019 type. In this system, students lived with the teacher or \u2018guru\u2019 in the same house. However, even at that time, India was reputed for many global universities like Nalanda.\n\nThe colonial conquest led to the fall of the education system in India. For the initial sixty-odd years, the British did not pay any heed to advancing the education system in the country. As their territory increased and they started to control the revenue and administration, the need for educating the Indians in English became a necessity to procure manpower.\n\nLater, the Brtish started on a mission to abolish the ancient gurukulam system and sowed seeds for the cultural and linguistic upheaval of the country.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of Education policies in British India\nEducation policies in India under the English East India Company\nThe Charter Act of 1813\nMacauley\u2019s minutes / The English Education act of 1835\nWood\u2019s despatch of 1854\nEducation policies in India under the Royal Crown of British\n1882: Hunter commission on Indian education\n1902: Raleigh commission\n1904: Indian Universities Act\n1913: Government Resolution on Education Policy\n1917-19: Saddler University commission\n1929: Hartog committee\n1937: Wardha Scheme of basic education by the Indian National Congress (INC)\n1944: Sergeant Plan of Education by the Central Advisory Board of Education\nHistory of Education policies in British India\n\nThe History of Education policies in British India can be classified into two \u2013 before 1857 (under the English East India Company) and after 1857 (under the British Crown).\n\nEducation policies in India under the English East India Company\n\n1781: Governor-General of Bengal, Warren Hastings established Calcutta Madarasa for Islamic law studies.

But this college was closed in 1802 due to disapproval of the British administration in England on Indianising the English civil servants.\n\nTHE CHARTER ACT OF 1813\n\nThis was the first noted step towards modern education in the country by the British. This act set aside an annual sum of Rs.1 lakh to be used in educating the Indian subjects.\n\nDuring all this time the Christian missionaries were active in mass educating the people but they concentrated more on religious teachings and conversions.\n\nMACAULEY\u2019S MINUTES / THE ENGLISH EDUCATION ACT OF 1835\n\nGovernor-General William Bentick\u2019s tenure saw more funds being allocated to education, and the policies were based on the recommendation of Macauley\u2019s minute.\n\nWe have to remember that Thomas Macauley had no knowledge or value for Indian and oriental literature and considered western science to be superior to all. He had famously said that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d.\n\nThe gist of the minute is:\n\nGovernment should spend resources for teaching western sciences and literature in English alone.\nEnglish should be made the medium of education in schools and colleges.\nElementary schools were not given importance, rather more schools at district levels and colleges were suggested to be opened. Hence, mass education was neglected.\nDownward filtration theory: The British decided to educate a small section of upper and middle-class Indians who would be the bridge between the masses and the government. And this educated would spread western education to the masses gradually.\n\nAdam\u2019s report on vernacular education in Bengal and Bihar was published in 1835, 1836, and 1838 which pointed out the defects in the system of vernacular education.\n\n1843-53: James Jonathan experiment in North West province where he introduced one model school in each tehsil where the vernacular language was used for teaching. There was also another school for training the teachers for these vernacular schools.\n\nWOOD\u2019S DESPATCH OF 1854\n\nIt is also known as the \u2018Magna Carta of English education in India\u2019 was the first comprehensive plan to envisage mass education in India.\n\nIt prompted the government to take responsibility for education and suggested grants in aid to encourage private enterprises to invest in education.\n\nVernacular languages should be used in primary schools in villages.\nAnglo-vernacular high schools\nAffiliated college at the district level\nUniversities in presidency towns\nGave impetus to female education and vocational training.\nLaid down that there should be secular education in government schools.\n\nViceroy Mayo\u2019s term saw the establishment of Rajkot college in Kathiawar in 1868 and Mayo college of Ajmer in 1875 for the political training of the Indian princes and elites.\n\nEducation policies in India under the Royal Crown of British\n\nUnder the British Crown, various commissions like Hunter, Raleigh, Saddler etc submitted recommendations for the reforms in the Indian Education system.\n\n1882: HUNTER COMMISSION ON INDIAN EDUCATION\n\nIt recommended more government efforts for the improvement of mass education through vernacular languages.\n\nTransfer of control of primary education to the new district and municipal boards.\nEncourage female education outside presidency towns also.\nSecondary education should be divided into 2 categories-\nLiterary ( leads to university through entrance exam)\nVocational (for commercial jobs)\n1902: RALEIGH COMMISSION\n\nViceroy Curzon believed that universities were the factories producing students with revolutionary ideologies; hence he constituted the commission to review the entire university education system in India.\n\nThe recommendation of the commission led to the universities act of 1904.\n\n1904: INDIAN UNIVERSITIES ACT\n\nThe Act brought all Indian universities under the control of the government. The key provisions of the act were-\n\nMore attention to study and research in universities rather than revolutionary activities\nThe number of fellows were reduced and were to be nominated by the government\nThe government acquired veto power against university senate decisions.\nStricter affiliation rules.\n\n1906: The princely state of Baroda introduced compulsory primary education in its territories.\n\n1913: GOVERNMENT RESOLUTION ON EDUCATION POLICY\nThe government refused to adhere to the demand by leaders of the national movement to introduce compulsory primary education in British India; they did not want the responsibility of mass education.\nBut announced a future policy for the removal of illiteracy.\nProvincial governments were asked to take responsibility to provide free elementary education to poorer and backward classes.\nQuality of secondary education and private efforts to be improved.\nOne university is to be established in each province.\n1917-19: SADDLER UNIVERSITY COMMISSION\n\nIt was originally set up to study and report the causes behind the poor performance of Calcutta University however it ended up reviewing all the universities in the country.\n\nIt said that the improvement of secondary education is necessary for the improvement of university education.\nSchool should be completed in 12 years-\nStudents to enter university after intermediate stage (not matric) for a 3-year university degree.\nThis would better prepare students for university and make them at par with university standards.\nIt will provide collegiate education to those not taking up university degrees.\nSeparate board for secondary and intermediate education.\nUniversity should function as a centralized and resident teaching autonomous body.\nFocus on female education, applied scientific and technical education, teachers training.\n\n1916-21: 7 new universities came up at Mysore, Patna, Benares, Aligarh, Dacca, Lucknow, and Osmania.\n\n1920: The Saddler commission recommendations were handed over to the provincial government as education was shifted under provinces in the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms. This caused a financial crunch in the education sector.\n\n1929: HARTOG COMMITTEE\nProvide primary education but not need of compulsory education system.\nOnly deserving students should be allowed to study in high schools and intermediate stage whereas average students should be diverted to vocational courses.\nRestricted admissions in university to improve standards.\n1937: WARDHA SCHEME OF BASIC EDUCATION BY THE INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS (INC)\n\nCongress organized a national conference on education in Wardha and formulated a committee under Zakir Hussain for basic education.\n\nThe scheme focused on \u201clearning through activity\u201d which was based on Gandhiji\u2019s ideas published in Harijan.\n\nBasic handicrafts should be included in the syllabus\nFirst 7 years of school to be free and compulsory\nHindi as medium till class 7 and English from class 8 onwards.\n\nThese ideas were not implemented due to the resignation of the congress ministries due to the start of World War II.\n\n1944: SERGEANT PLAN OF EDUCATION BY THE CENTRAL ADVISORY BOARD OF EDUCATION\nFree primary education for 3-6 years age group.\nCompulsory education for 6-11 years age group\nHigh school to selected students of 11-17 years age group.\nImprove technical, commercial, and arts education\nFocus on teachers\u2019 training, physical education, and education of mentally and physically handicapped.\n\nThe above policies during the British era shaped the modern universities and education system prevailing in India today."

They were \u2013 Zamindari, Ryotwari and Mahalwari.\n\n1. Zamindari System (Permanent Land Revenue Settlement)\n\nZamindari System was introduced by Cornwallis in 1793 through the Permanent Settlement Act.\nIt was introduced in the provinces of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Varanasi.\nAlso known as\u00a0Permanent Settlement System.\nZamindars were recognized as the owner of the lands. Zamindars were given the rights to collect the rent from the peasants.\nWhile the zamindars became the owners of the land, the actual farmers became tenants.\nThe tax was to be paid even at the time of poor yield.\nThe tax was to be paid in cash. Before introducing this system, the tax could be paid in kind.\nThe realized amount would be divided into 11 parts. 1/11 of the share belongs to Zamindars and 10/11 of the share belongs to East India Company.\n2. Ryotwari System\nRyotwari System was introduced by Thomas Munro in 1820.\nThis was the primary land revenue system in South India.\nMajor areas of introduction include Madras, Bombay, parts of Assam and Coorg provinces of British India.\nIn Ryotwari System the ownership rights were handed over to the peasants. British Government collected taxes directly from the peasants.\nThe revenue rates of the Ryotwari System were 50% where the lands were dry and 60% in irrigated land.\nThough ownership of land was vested with the farmers, excessive tax impoverished them. Furthermore, the tax rates were frequently increased.\n3. Mahalwari System\nMahalwari system was introduced in 1822 by Holt Mackenzie. Later, the system was reformed during the period of William Bentick (1833).\nThis was the primary land revenue system in North-West India.\nIt was introduced in Central Province, North-West Frontier, Agra, Punjab, Gangetic Valley, etc of British India.\nIn this system, the land was divided into Mahals. Each Mahal comprises one or more villages.\nThe entire village (Mahal) was considered as a single unit for tax collection.\nThe village headman or villages committee was assigned the responsibility to collect tax.\nOwnership rights were vested with the peasants.\nThe tax rate was excessive in this system too.\nThe Mahalwari system had many provisions of both the Zamindari System and Ryotwari System.\nProblems created by the British Land Revenue Policies\n\nThe land revenue policies implemented by the British affected the agricultural sector.\n\nWhen the farmers were unable to pay tax in the form of money before the deadline, they had to take a loan from moneylenders at a high rate of interest. The loans were obtained by mortgaging\nagricultural land. The agricultural land of the farmers, who could not pay back the loan and interest, was seized by the money lenders.\n\nLand Reforms in India After Independence\n\nZamindari Abolition Act was passed by UP, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, etc.\u00a0Surplus lands were confiscated from zamindars.\n\nLater\u00a0Land Ceilings Act was passed by different states, fixing an upper limit for private landholdings.\n\nLand reforms in India are discussed in detail in the highlighted link.

His mother was Putlibai who came from Junagadh. Mohandas was the youngest of four children. He had two brothers and a sister.\n\nAt age of 13, Mohandas was married to 14-year-old Kastubai Makhanji Kapadia as was the custom at that time.\n\nHis father passed away in 1885, and the same year he and his wife lost their first child. The Gandhi couple later had four sons over the years.\n\nEducation of Mahatma Gandhi\n\nGandhi Ji received his primary education in Rajkot where his father had relocated as dewan to the ruler Thakur Sahib. He went to Alfred high school in Rajkot at the age of 11.\n\nIn 1887, at the age of 18, Gandhi Ji graduated from a high school in Ahmedabad. He later enrolled at a college in Bhavnagar but dropped out later. He had also joined and eventually dropped out of a college in Bombay.\n\nHe then went to London in 1888 to pursue law at the university college. After completing his studies, he was invited to be enrolled at Inner temple to become a barrister.\n\nHe returned to India in 1891 at the age of 22 after his mother passed away.\n\nHe failed to establish a successful law career both in Rajkot and Bombay.\n\nIn 1893, he moved to Durban, South Africa, on a one-year contract to sort out the legal problems of Abdullah, a Gujarati merchant.\n\nSouth Africa during the 1800s\n\nThe British had colonized and settled in the Natal and Cape provinces of South Africa during the 1840s and 50s. Transvaal and Orange Free State were independent Boer (British and Dutch settlers) ruled states. Boer means farmer settler in Dutch and Afrikaans. The governance of colonial regions (Natal and Cape) was controlled by the minority white population which enforced segregation between government-defined races in all spheres.\n\nThis created three societies- whites (British and Dutch or Boer ancestry), Blacks and Coloureds (mixed race) which included ethnic Asians (Indians, Malayans, Filipinos, and Chinese).\n\nIndian immigration to South Africa began in the 1860s, when whites recruited indentured Indian labour (Girmityas), especially from south India, to work on sugar plantations. Later many Indian merchants, mostly meman Muslims also migrated. By the 1890s, the children of the ex-indentured labourers had settled down in South Africa making up the third group.\n\nMahatma Gandhi in South Africa\n\n1893: Mohandas Gandhi witnessed extreme apartheid or racial discrimination against Asians in South Africa. His journey from Durban to Pretoria witnessed the famous incident when he was thrown out of a first-class compartment by a white man at Pietermaritzburg station. Upon arriving at Johanessburg, he was refused rooms in the hotels.\n\nThese experiences motivated him to stay in South Africa for a longer period to organize the Indian workers to enable them to fight for their rights. He started teaching English to the Asian population there and tried to organize them to protest against the oppression.\n\n1894: After the culmination of his Abdullah case in 1894, he stayed on there and planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote. He founded the Natal Indian Congress and moulded the Indian community into a unified political force.\n\n1899-1902: The Boer War\n\nThe Boer War extended Britain\u2019s control from Natal and Cape Province to include Transvaal and Orange Free State.\n\nDuring this time, Gandhi volunteered to form a group of stretcher-bearers as the Natal Indian ambulance corps. It consisted of indentured labourers and was funded by the Indian community and helped treatment and evacuation of wounded British soldiers.\n\nGandhi Ji thought that helping the British war efforts would win over the British imperial government and earn sympathy for the plight of Indians there. He was also awarded the Queen\u2019s South Africa Medal for serving the British empire.\n\nTill 1906, it was the moderate phase of the struggle for the Indians in South Africa. During this time, Gandhi concentrated on petitioning and sending memorials to the legislatures, the colonial secretary in London, and the British parliament.\n\n1906: The Civil Disobedience in South Africa\n\nThe failure of moderate methods led to the second phase of the struggle, civil disobedience or the Satyagraha.\n\nHe started two settlements- the Phoenix settlement in Durban and the Tolstoy farm in Johanessburg for helping the needy and initiate a communal living tradition.\n\nHis first notable resistance was against the law passed by the government, making it compulsory for Indians to take out certifications of registrations that held their fingerprints and was compulsory to carry it on the person at all times. Gandhi formed a Passive Resistance Association against this.\n\nGandhi and his followers were jailed. Later the government agreed to withdraw the law if Indians voluntarily registered. They were tricked into the registrations and they protested again by publicly burning their certificates.\n\n1908: The existing campaign expanded to protest against the new law to restrict migrations of Indians between provinces. Gandhi and others were jailed and sentenced to hard physical labour.\n\n1910: Gandhi Ji set up the Tolstoy farm in Johannesburg to ready the satyagrahis to the harsh conditions of the prison hence helping to keep the resistance moving forward.\n\n1911: Gopal Krishna Gokhale visited South Africa as a state guest on the occasion of the coronation of King George V. Gokhale and Gandhi met at Durban and established a good relationship.\n\n1913: The satyagraha continued against varied oppressive laws brought by the government. The movement against the law invalidating marriages not conducted according to Christian rites brought out many Indian women onto the movement.\n\nGandhi launched a final mass movement of over 2000 men, women, and children. They were jailed and forced into miserable conditions and hard labour. This caused the whole Indian community in South Africa to rise on strike.\n\nIn India, Gokhale worked to make the public aware of the situation in South Africa which led the then Viceroy Hardinge to call for an inquiry into the atrocities.\n\nA series of negotiations took place between Gandhiji, Viceroy Hardinge, CR Andrews (Christian missionary and Indian Independence activist), and General Smuts of South Africa. This led to the government conceding to most of the Indians\u2019 demands.\n\nGandhiji\u2019s return to India: 1915\n\n1915: On the request of Gokhale, conveyed by CF Andrews (Deenbandhu), Gandhi Ji returned to India to help with the Indian struggle for independence.\n\nThe last phase of the Indian National movement is known as the Gandhian era.\n\nMahatma Gandhi became the undisputed leader of the National Movement. His principles of nonviolence and Satyagraha were employed against the British government. Gandhi made the nationalist movement a mass movement.\n\nOn returning to India in 1915, Gandhi toured the country for one year on Gokhale\u2019s insistence. He then established an ashram in Ahmedabad to settle his phoenix family.\n\nHe first took up the cause of indentured labour in India thus continuing his fight in South Africa to abolish it.\n\nGandhiji joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues and politics and Gokhale became his political Guru.\n\n1917: At this point, World war I was going on, and Britain and France were in a difficult position. Germany had inflicted a crushing defeat on both the British and French troops in France.\n\nRussia\u2019s war effort had broken down and the revolution was threatening its government.\n\nAmerica had entered the war but no American troops had yet reached the war front.\n\nThe British army required reinforcements urgently and they looked to India for participation. Viceroy Chelmsford had invited various Indian leaders to attend a war conference. Gandhi was also invited and he went to Delhi to attend the conference.\n\nAfter attending the viceroy\u2019s war conference Gandhiji agreed to support the recruitment of Indians in the British war effort. He undertook a recruitment campaign in Kaira district, Gujarat.\n\nHe again believed that support from Indians will make the British government look at their plight sympathetically after the war.\n\nEarly movements by Gandhiji\n\nChamparan Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, and Ahmedabad Mill Strike were the early movements of Gandhi before he was elevated into the role of a national mass leader.\n\n1917: Champaran Satyagraha\n\nChamparan Satyagraha of 1917 was the first civil disobedience movement organized by Gandhiji. Rajkumar Shukla asked Gandhi to look into the problems of the Indigo planters.\n\nThe European planters had been forcing passengers to grow Indigo on a 3/20 of the total land called the tinkatiya system.\n\nGandhi organized passive resistance or civil disobedience against the tinkatiya system. Finally, the authorities relented and permitted Gandhi to make inquiries among the peasants. The government appointed a committee to look into the matter and nominated Gandhi as a member.\n\nRajendra Prasad, Anugrah Narayan Sinha, and other eminent lawyers became inspired by Gandhi and volunteered to fight for the Indigo farmers in court for free.\n\nGandhi was able to convince the authorities to abolish the system and the peasants were compensated for the illegal dues extracted from them.\n\n1918: Kheda satyagraha\n\nThe Kheda Satyagraha was the first noncooperation movement organized by Gandhi.\n\nBecause of the drought in 1918 crops failed in the Kheda district of Gujarat. According to the revenue code if the yield was less than one-fourth of the normal produced the farmers for entitled to remission. Gujarat sabha sent a petition requesting revenue assessment for the year 1919 but the authorities refused to grant permission.\n\nGandhi supported the peasants\u2019 cause and asked them to withhold revenue. During the Satyagraha, many young nationalists such as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Indulal Yagnik became Gandhi\u2019s followers.\n\nSardar Patel led a group of eminent people who went around villages and gave them political advisors and instructions.\n\nThe government finally agreed to form an agreement with the farmers and hence the taxes were suspended for the years 1919 and 1920 and all confiscated properties were returned.\n\n1918: Ahmedabad mill strike\n\nThis was Gandhi\u2019s first hunger strike. He intervened in a dispute between Mill owners of Ahmedabad and the workers over the issue of discontinuation of the plague bonus.\n\nThe workers were demanding a rise of 50% in their wages while the employees were willing to concede only a 20% bonus.\n\nThe striking workers turned to Anusuiya Sarabai in quest of justice and she contacted Gandhi for help. He asked the workers to go on a strike and to remain non-violent and undertook a fast unto death to strengthen the workers\u2019 resolve.\n\nThe mill owners finally agreed to submit the issue to a tribunal and the strike was withdrawn in the end the workers receive a 35% increase in their wages.\n\nGandhiji\u2019s active involvement in the Indian National Movement\n\nGandhi\u2019s active involvement in the Indian Freedom Struggle was marked by many mass movements like the Khilafat Movement, Non-Cooperation Movement, Civil Disobedience Movement, and Quit India Movement.\n\n1919: Khilafat movement\n\nDuring World War I Gandhi sought cooperation from the Muslims in his fight against the British by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the world war.\n\nThe British passed the Rowlatt act to block the movement. Gandhi called for a nationwide Satyagraha against the act.\n\nIt was Rowlatt Satyagraha that elevated Gandhi into a national leader. Rowlatt Satyagraha was against the unjust Rowlatt Act passed by the British.\n\nOn April 13th, 1919 the Jallianwala Bagh incident took place. Seeing the violence spread Mahatma Gandhi called off the civil disobedience movement on the 18th of April.\n\n1920: Non-Cooperation Movement\n\nGandhi convinced the congress leaders to start a Non-Cooperation Movement in support of Khilafat as well as Swaraj. At the congress session of Nagpur in 1920, the non-cooperation program was adopted.\n\n1922: Chauri chaura incident took place, which caused Gandhi to withdraw from the non-cooperation movement.\n\nAfter the non-cooperation movement ended, Gandhi withdrew from the political platform and focused on his social reform work.\n\n1930: \u00a0The Salt March and The Civil Disobedience Movement\n\nGandhi declared that he would lead a march to break the salt law as the law gave the state the Monopoly on the manufacturer and the sale of salt.\n\nGandhi along with his followers marched from his ashram in Sabarmati to the coastal town of Dandi in Gujarat where they broke the government law by gathering natural salt and boiling seawater to produce salt.\n\nThis also marked the beginning of the civil disobedience movement.\n\n1931: The Gandhi Irwin pact\n\nGandhi accepted the truce offered by Irwin and called off the civil disobedience movement and agreed to attend the second round table conference in London as the representative of the Indian National Congress.\n\nBut when he returned from London he relaunched the civil disobedience movement but by 1934 it had lost its momentum.\n\n1932: Poona pact\n\nThis was a pact reached between B.R Ambedkar and Gandhi concerning the communal awards but in the end, strived to achieve a common goal for the upliftment of the marginalized communities of the Indian society.\n\n1934: Gandhi resigned from the Congress party membership as he did not agree with the party\u2019s position on varied issues.\n\nGandhi returned to active politics in 1936 with the Lucknow session of Congress where Jawaharlal Nehru was the president.\n\n1938: Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose\u2019s principles clashed during the Tripuri session which led to the Tripuri crisis in the Indian National Congress.\n\n1942: Quit India movement\n\nThe outbreak of World war II and the last and crucial phase of national struggle in India came together.\n\nThe failure of the Cripps mission in 1942 gave rise to the Quit India movement.\n\nGandhi was arrested and held at Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this time his wife Kasturba died after 18 months of imprisonment and in 1944 Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack.\n\nHe was released before the end of the war on 6th May 1944. World war II was nearing an end and the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indians hence Gandhi called off the struggle and all the political prisoners were released including the leaders of Congress.\n\nPartition and independence\n\nGandhiji opposed the partition of India along religious lines.\n\nWhile he and Congress demanded the British quit India the Muslim league demanded to divide and quit India.\n\nAll of Gandhi\u2019s efforts to help Congress and the Muslim league reach an agreement to corporate and attain independence failed.\n\nGandhiji did not celebrate the independence and end of British rule but appealed for peace among his countrymen. He was never in agreement for the country to be partitioned.\n\nHis demeanour played a key role in pacifying the people and avoiding a Hindu-Muslim riot during the partition of the rest of India.\n\nDeath of Mahatma Gandhi\n\n30th January 1948\n\nGandhiji was on his way to address a prayer meeting in the Birla House in New Delhi when Nathuram Godse fired three bullets into his chest from close range killing him instantly.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\u2019s legacy\n\nThroughout his life, in his principles practices, and beliefs, he always held on to non-violence and simple living. He influenced many great leaders and the nation respectfully addresses him as the father of the nation or Bapu.\n\nHe worked for the upliftment of untouchables and called them Harijan meaning the children of God.\n\nRabindranath Tagore is said to have accorded the title of Mahatma to Gandhi.\n\nIt was Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose who first addressed him as the Father of the Nation.\n\nGandhian Philosophy inspired millions of people across the world.\n\nMany great world leaders like Nelson Mandela followed Gandhiji\u2019s teachings and way of life. Hence, his impact on the global stage is still very profound.\n\nLiterary works of Mahatma Gandhi\n\nGandhiji was a prolific writer and he has written many articles throughout his life. He edited several newspapers including Harijan in Gujarati, Indian opinion in South Africa, and Young India in English.\n\nHe also wrote several books including his autobiography \u201cThe Story Of My Experiments with Truth\u201d."

He was born into a family of Kashmiri Pandits, who had migrated to Delhi early in the 18th century.\n\nHis father was Motilal Nehru, a renowned lawyer, and leader of the Indian independence movement. His mother was Swarup Rani Thussu who was also part of a well-known Kashmiri Pandit family.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru has two sisters and a brother. His sister Vijay Lakshmi Pandit, later became the first female president of the\u00a0United Nations General Assembly.\u00a0His youngest sister,\u00a0Krishna Hutheesing, became a noted writer and authored several books on her brother.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nEducation:\n\nNehru was educated at home by a series of English governesses and tutors until the age of 16.\n\nIn 1905 he went to\u00a0Harrow, a leading English school, where he stayed for two years.\n\nHe then attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years earning an honors degree in natural science. On leaving Cambridge he qualified as a barrister after two years at the Inner Temple, London.\n\nAs a student, he had been interested in the struggle of all nations that suffered under foreign rule. He took a keen interest in the Sinn Fein Movement in Ireland.\n\nThe political journey of Jawaharlal Nehru\n\nHe returned to India in 1912 and plunged straight into politics. Here, he was inevitably drawn into the struggle for independence. He enrolled as an advocate of the Allahabad High Court, but he had very little interest in the profession, unlike his father who was a successful barrister.\n\n1912: Nehru attended the Bankipore Congress session as a delegate. The Congress party at that time consisted of moderates and elites, and Nehru immediately doubted the effect they could have on Indian society. But he agreed to work with the party in support of the Indian Civil Rights movement led by Gandhi in South Africa.\n\n1914-15: World War I broke out and there were feelings among Indians regarding the war. Nehru worked as a volunteer for the St. John Ambulance during the war.\n\nNehru grew through the war years as a leader whose political views were considered radical. The political discourse at the time had been dominated by moderates like Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who considered independence a far-fetched idea.\n\nThe death of Gokhale in 1915 led to the fading out of moderate ideology and the political stage was taken over by radical leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Annie Besant who started the Home Rule movement.\n\n1916: Jawaharlal Nehru met Gandhi Ji for the first time in the Lucknow session of Congress. He is said to have been inspired by the senior.\n\nNehru also got married to Kamala Kaul in 1916 and had a daughter Indira Priyadarshini in 1917.\n\n1919: Nehru became the secretary of the Home Rule League, Allahabad.\n\n1920: He organized the first Kisan March in the Pratapgarh District of Uttar Pradesh. He was twice imprisoned in connection with the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920-22.\n\n1922: Gandhiji called back the Non-Cooperation movement in 1922 due to the Chauri Chaura incident. This caused a rift in Congress and leaders like Motilal Nehru and CR Das formed the Swaraj Party, while Jawaharlal Nehru remained loyal to Gandhiji\u2019s decision.\n\n1923: Nehru became the General Secretary of the All India Congress Committee in September 1923.\n\n1926: Nehru toured Italy, Switzerland, England, Belgium, Germany, and Russia in 1926. He attended the Congress of Oppressed Nationalities in Brussels, Belgium as an official delegate of the Indian National Congress.\n\nHe also attended the tenth-anniversary celebrations of the October Socialist Revolution in Moscow in 1927.\n\n1928: He was lathi-charged in Lucknow in 1928 while leading a procession against the Simon commission.\n\nOn August 29, 1928, he attended the All-Party Congress and was one of the signatories to the Nehru Report on Indian Constitutional Reform, named after his father Motilal Nehru.\n\nHe also founded the \u2018Independence for India League\u2019 along with Subhas Chandra Bose, which advocated complete severance of the British connection with India, and became its General Secretary.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru\u2019s presidency of INC sessions\n\n1929: Nehru was elected President of the Lahore Session of the Indian National Congress, where complete independence for the country was adopted as the goal. At midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve 1929, Nehru hoisted the tricolour of India upon the banks of the Ravi in Lahore.\n\nHe drafted a resolution, Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy in 1929-31 which had the core aims of the Congress and the future of the nation.\n\nThe resolution was ratified by the Congress party in the Karachi Session, 1931, chaired by Saradar Vallabhai Patel.\n\nHe was imprisoned several times during 1930-35 in connection with the Salt Satyagraha and other movements launched by Congress. He completed his Autobiography in Almora Jail on February 14, 1935.\n\n1936-38: Nehru traveled to Europe again due to his wife\u2019s illness. But this trip also sparked his interest in socialism and Marxism.\n\nHe was elected President of the Lucknow Session in 1936 again. The Congress party decided to contest the provincial elections of 1937 despite disagreement from Nehru and Gandhi Ji.\n\nNehru wanted to elevate Maulana Azad, who was also socialist, as the voice of Indian Muslims, but Gandhiji\u2019s support of Jinnah and the Muslim league undermined this view of Nehru.\n\n1939: World War II broke out and Viceroy Linlithgow declared India into war without consulting the Indian representatives.\n\nThe Congress under Nehru informed the government that it would cooperate with the British but on certain conditions, but the Viceroy rejected the conditions.\n\nOn 23 October 1939, Congress called upon the Congress ministries in the various provinces to resign in protest. \u00a0Before this crucial announcement, Nehru urged Jinnah and the Muslim League to join the protest, but Jinnah declined.\n\nCivil disobedience, Lahore resolution, and August offer\n\n1940: Jinnah and the Muslim League also passed the Pakistan resolution in 1940, demanding a separate Muslim nation called Pakistan.\n\nLinlithgow made the August offer to Nehru offering domino status to India in return for support in World War II. The Indian leaders rejected the offer calling it incomplete and vague.\n\nNehru was arrested for offering individual Satyagraha to protest against India\u2019s forced participation in the war. He was released along with the other leaders in December 1941.\n\nThe Japanese attack, Cripps Mission, and Quit India movement\n\nIn 1942, Japan attacked India through Burma, and the British threatened by the attack decided to hold talks with Indian Leaders.\n\nPrime Minister Winston Churchill dispatched Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the British War Cabinet who was politically close to Nehru and also knew Jinnah, with proposals for a settlement of the constitutional problem. Cripps\u2019s mission failed, however, for Indian leaders under Gandhi and Nehru would accept nothing less than independence.\n\n1942: Nehru moved the historic \u2018Quit India\u2019 resolution at the All India Congress Committee session in Bombay.\n\nOn August 8, 1942, he was arrested along with other leaders and taken to Ahmednagar Fort. This was the longest and last of his detentions.\n\n1945: He was released in January, after which he organized legal defense for the officers and men of the Indian National Army (INA) charged with treason.\n\n1946: He was elected President of the Congress for the fourth time on July 6, 1946, and again for three more terms from 1951 to 1954.\n\nCabinet mission and the interim government\n\nA final attempt was made by the viceroy Wavell to bring the Congress Party and the Muslim League together, which failed. The Labour government that had meanwhile displaced Churchill\u2019s wartime administration sent a Cabinet Mission to India and later replaced Lord Wavell with Lord Mountbatten.\n\n1946: The Cabinet Mission was sent to India to propose a plan for the transfer of power. This led to elections to provincial assemblies, and members elected members of the constituent assembly. An interim government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru as Prime Minister. The Muslim league joined the government later with Liaquat Ali Khan as Finance minister.\n\nOn August 15, 1947, India and Pakistan were partitioned as two separate independent countries.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru: The first Prime Minister of India\n\nJawaharlal Nehru took office as Prime Minister of independent India on 15th August and his inaugural address was called \u2018Tryst with Destiny\u2019.\n\n1947: Nehru declares that no princely state would exist in independent India and that they need to join the constituent assembly. He made Vallabhbai Patel and V.P. Menon in charge of integrating the states, in which they were successful.\n\n1950: The new Constitution of India came into force on 26th January 1950 making India a sovereign democratic republic.\n\n1952: The first elections under the new constitution of India were held. Congress Party under Nehru\u2019s leadership won the elections and formed the first elected government of the Republic of India.\n\n1952-57: Second Nehru Ministry at the Centre\n\nJawaharlal Nehru appointed the States Reorganization Commission in 1953 to organize states on a linguistic basis. This commission was headed by Justice Fazal Ali.\n\nHe advocated democratic socialism and encouraged India\u2019s industrialization by implementing the first five-year plans. He attempted to push the development by undertaking both agrarian reforms and industrialization together.\n\n1958-62: Third Nehru Ministry at the Centre\n\nThe Congress party won the 1957 and later 1962 elections as well. Nehru served as Prime Minister of India for three consecutive terms, for 17 years.\n\nHe annexed Goa into India from the Portuguese occupation in 1961 after years of failed negotiations. He was lauded and criticized for the use of force internally and externally.\n\nThe Sino-Indian War of 1962 was a troubled time under his last term as Prime Minister.\n\nDeath of Jawaharlal Nehru\n\nHe died of a heart attack on 27\u00a0May 1964.\n\nLal Bahadur Shastri took over as the second Prime Minister of India.\n\nNehru\u2019s legacy\n\nNehru was popular among the citizens of India as well on a global level. His secular approach to politics contrasted with Gandhi\u2019s religious and traditionalist attitude. Because of his modern political and economic outlook, he was able to attract the younger intellectual crowd of India to the independence movement against the British.\n\nNehru embarked India on modern lines while keeping in touch with traditional Indian aspects. He imparted modern values and ways of thinking, which he adapted to Indian conditions.\n\nHe stressed secularism and the basic unity of India, despite its ethnic and religious diversities. He was deeply concerned with carrying India forward into the modern age of scientific discovery and technological development.\n\nNehru wanted his people to have an awareness and social concern for the poor and the outcast and respect for democratic values.\n\nHe was particularly proud of the reform of the ancient Hindu civil code that finally enabled Hindu\u00a0widows\u00a0to enjoy equality with men in matters of inheritance and property.\n\nThe Kashmir problem remained a\u00a0perennial throughout Nehru\u2019s term as prime minister.\n\nHe had a great love for children and was fondly called Chacha Nehru. His birthday is celebrated as Children\u2019s Day in India.\n\nHe encouraged and advanced India\u2019s education by establishing the top-tier institutions of India including the Indian Institute of Technology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India\u2019s first Space Program, etc.\n\nHis former residence, the Trimurti Bhavan has been converted into a museum giving a glimpse of the former prime minister\u2019s life.\n\nInternational relations under Nehru\n\nHis most important contribution to geopolitics is considered the Non-alignment moment (NAM). India and a few other countries decided to not align with any superpower during the Cold War era post World War II.\n\nHowever, Nehru\u2019s popularity saw a decline when India was the only nonaligned country to vote with the Soviet Union on the invasion of Hungary in the United Nations. At last, the Sino-Indian War of 1962 forced Nehru to divert fully from the NAM to procure help from the Western forces.\n\nIn 1954, Nehru signed the Five Principles of Coexistence with China known as Panchsheel in India. India recognized Chinese sovereignty over Tibet with this. Relations with China under Nehru\u2019s leadership saw many ups and downs throughout.\n\nLiterary works by Nehru\n\nHe authored many books in his lifetime, to name a few-\n\nThe Discovery of India\nGlimpses of the world\nAn Autobiography\nLetters from a father to his daughter\n\nAll through his 17 years in the prime minister\u2019s office, he held up democratic socialism, emphasizing that India needed to achieve both democracy and socialism. The four pillars of his domestic policies were democracy, socialism, unity, and secularism. He successfully integrated these pillars into the building of modern India.\n\nAlso read: August Offer: A breakpoint in India\u2019s freedom struggle"

In his early years, Patel was considered by many as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job. However, Patel proved them wrong. He passed law examination, often studying himself, with borrowed books.\n\nPatel practised law at Godhra, Borsad, and Anand in Gujarat, after passing the bar examination.\u00a0He earned the reputation of being a fierce and skilled lawyer.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPatel\u2019s early willingness to sacrifice for others\n\nPatel had a dream to study law in England. Using his hard-earned savings, he managed to get a pass and a ticket to go to England.\n\nHowever, the ticket was addressed to \u2018V.J. Patel\u2019. His elder brother Vithalbhai also had the same initials as Vallabhai. Sardar Patel came to know that his elder brother too cherished a dream to go to England for studies.\n\nIn keeping with concerns for his family\u2019s honour (disreputable for an older brother to follow his younger brother), Vallabhbhai Patel allowed Vithalbhai Patel to go, in his place.\n\nPatel\u2019s Journey to England\n\nIn 1911, at the age of 36, two years after the death of his wife, Vallabhbhai Patel journeyed to England and enrolled at the\u00a0Middle Temple\u00a0Inn in London. Patel finished at the top of his class despite having had no previous college background. He completed the 36-month course in 30 months.\n\nReturning to India, Patel settled in\u00a0Ahmedabad\u00a0and became one of the city\u2019s most successful barristers.\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel\u2019s role in the Indian Freedom Movement\n\nIn the initial stages of the freedom movement, Patel was neither keen on active politics nor the principles of Mahatma Gandhi. However, the meeting with Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in Godhra (1917) fundamentally changed Patel\u2019s life.\n\nPatel joined the Congress and became the secretary of the Gujarat Sabha that became a Congress stronghold later.\n\nOn Gandhi\u2019s call, Patel quit his hard-earned job and joined the movement to fight for exemption of taxes in Kheda at the time of plague and famine (1918).\n\nPatel joined Gandhi\u2019s Non-Cooperation Movement (1920) and travelled around West India to recruit 3,00,000 members. He also collected more than Rs 1.5 million for the party fund.\n\nThere was a British law banning the hoisting of the Indian Flag. When Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned, it was Patel who led the Satyagraha movement in Nagpur in 1923 against British law.\n\nIt was the Bardoli Satyagraha of 1928 which earned Vallabhbhai Patel the title of \u2018Sardar\u2019 and made him popular throughout the country. So great was the impact that Pandit Motilal Nehru suggested Vallabhbhai\u2019s name to Gandhiji for the presidency of the Congress.\n\nIn 1930, the British arrested Sardar Patel during the Salt Satyagraha and put him on trial without witnesses.\n\nOn the outbreak of World War II (1939), Patel supported Nehru\u2019s decision to withdraw Congress from central and provincial legislatures.\n\nPatel was at his persuasive best when he spoke at the Gwalia Tank ground (now called August Kranti Maidan) in Mumbai to launch the nationwide civil disobedience movement in 1942 at the behest of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nDuring Quit India Movement (1942), the British arrested Patel. He was imprisoned with the entire\u00a0Congress Working Committee\u00a0from 1942 to 1945 at the fort in\u00a0Ahmednagar.\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel as Congress President\n\nAfter the signing of the Gandhi\u2013Irwin Pact, Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session (Karachi).\n\nCongress committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and civil liberties.\u00a0Patel advocated for the establishment of a secular nation. Minimum wages for workers and the abolition of untouchability were among his other priorities.\n\nPatel used his position as Congress president to organise the return of confiscated land to farmers in Gujarat.\n\nSardar Patel \u2013 The Social Reformer\n\nPatel worked extensively against alcohol consumption, untouchability, caste discrimination and for women emancipation in Gujarat and outside.\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel \u2013 As Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister\n\nAfter Independence, he became India\u2019s first Deputy Prime Minister. On the first anniversary of Independence, Patel was appointed as the Home Minister of India.\u00a0He was also in charge of the States Department and the Information and Broadcasting Ministry\n\nAs the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for refugees fleeing from Punjab and Delhi and worked to restore peace.\n\nIn what was to become Sardar Patel\u2019s most lasting legacy, he took charge of the States Department and was responsible for the accession of 565 princely states into the Union of India. Paying tribute to him, Nehru called Sardar \u2018the builder and consolidator of new India.\u2019\n\nHowever, the invaluable services of Sardar Patel were available to independent India for just 3 years. The brave son of India died on 15 December 1950 (aged 75), after suffering a massive heart attack.\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel\u2019s role in the Integration of the princely states\n\nSardar Patel despite his failing health and age never lost sight of the larger purpose of creating United India. As India\u2019s first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, Sardar Patel played a key role in the integration of about 565 princely states into the Indian Union.\n\nFew princely states like Travancore, Hyderabad, Junagadh, Bhopal and Kashmir were averse to joining the state of India.\n\nSardar Patel worked tirelessly to build a consensus with the princely states but did not hesitate in employing methods of\u00a0Sama, Dama, Dand and Bhed\u00a0where ever necessary.\n\nHe had used force to annex princely states of Junagadh ruled by Nawab and Hyderabad ruled by Nizam, both of whom had wished not to merge their respective states with the Union of India.\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel stitched the princely states along with British Indian territory and prevented the balkanization of India.\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel and All-India Services like IAS\n\nSardar Patel was of the opinion that we\u00a0will not have a united India if we do not have a good all-India Service.\n\nPatel was clearly conscious of the fact that independent India needed \u2018a steel frame to run its civil, military, and administrative bureaucracy. His faith in institutional mechanisms like having an organized command-based army and a systemized bureaucracy proved to be a blessing.\u2019\n\nHis exhortation to the probationers to maintain utmost impartiality and incorruptibility of administration is as relevant today as it was then.\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel as the first Prime Minister of India?\n\nIn the AICC Session of 15th January 1942 held at Wardha, Gandhiji formally designated Jawaharlal Nehru as his political successor. In Gandhiji\u2019s own words \u201c\u2026 not Rajaji, not Sardar Vallabhabhai, but Jawaharlal will be my successor\u2026When I am gone, he will speak my language\u201d.\n\nThus, it can be seen that it was none other than Gandhiji who wanted Nehru to lead India, apart from the masses. Patel always listened and obeyed Gandhi \u2013 who himself had no political ambitions in free India.\n\nHowever, for the post of Congress Presidentship in 1946, Pradesh Congress Committees (PCCs) had a different choice \u2013 Patel.\u00a0Even though Nehru had a great mass appeal, and a broader vision about the world, 12 out of 15 PCCs favoured Patel as Congress President. Patel\u2019s qualities \u2013 as a great executive, organizer and leader \u2013 were widely appreciated.\n\nWhen Nehru came to know about the PCCs choice, he remained silent. Mahatma Gandhi felt that \u201cJawaharlal will not take second place\u201d, and he asked Patel to withdraw his nomination for Congress President.\u00a0Patel, as always, obeyed Gandhi. Nehru took over as Congress President for a short period of time in 1946, before handing over the responsibility to J.B.Kriplani.\n\nFor Nehru, the Prime Ministership of Free India was just an extension of his role in the interim cabinet.\n\nIt was Jawaharlal Nehru who headed the interim government of India from 2nd September 1946 to 15th August 1947. Nehru was the Vice-President of the Viceroy\u2019s Executive Council with powers of the Prime Minister.\u00a0Vallabhbhai Patel held the second-most powerful position in the Council, heading the Department of Home Affairs and\u00a0Department of Information and Broadcasting.\n\nOn August 1, 1947, two weeks before India became independent, Nehru wrote to Patel a letter asking him to join the cabinet. Nehru, however, indicated that he already consider Patel as the strongest pillar of the Cabinet. Patel replied guaranteeing\u00a0unquestioned loyalty and devotion. He had also mentioned that their combination is unbreakable and therein lies their strength.\n\nNehru and Patel\n\nNehru and Patel was a rare combination. They complemented each other. The two great leaders of the Indian National Congress had mutual admiration and respect. There were differences in approach \u2013 but the end goal for both was to find what is best for India.\n\nThe differences of opinion were mostly regarding the Congress hierarchy, working style, or ideologies.\u00a0Within Congress \u2013 Nehru was widely considered Left-wing (socialism) while Patel\u2019s ideologies were aligned with the Right-wing (capitalism).\n\nThere were differences in the choice of Congress presidential candidates in 1950 between Nehru and Patel. Nehru supported J.B. Kriplani. Patel\u2019s choice was Purushottam Das Tandon. In the end, Kriplani was defeated by Patel\u2019s candidate\u00a0Purushottam Das Tandon.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the differences were never big enough to result in a major split in Congress or the Government.\n\nGandhi and Patel\n\nPatel was always loyal to Gandhi. However, he differed with Gandhiji on certain issues.\n\nFollowing Gandhiji\u2019s assassination, he said: \u201cI claim to be nothing more than an obedient soldier of him like the millions who obeyed his call. There was a time when everyone used to call me his blind follower. But, both he and I knew that I followed him because our convictions tallied\u201d.\n\nPatel and Somnath Temple\n\nOn\u00a0November 13, 1947,\u00a0Sardar Patel, the then Deputy Prime Minister of India, vowed to rebuild Somnath Temple. Somnath had been destroyed and built several times in the past. He felt that the story of its resurrection from ruins this time would be symbolic of the story of the resurgence of India.\n\nSardar Patel\u2019s Economic Ideas\n\nSelf-reliance was among the chief tenets of Patel\u2019s economic philosophy. He wanted to see India industrialise quickly. The imperative was to reduce dependence on external resources.\n\nPatel guided the\u00a0cooperative movements in Gujarat and helped in\u00a0setting up of the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers\u2019 Union which\u00a0proved to be a game-changer for dairy farming throughout the country.\n\nSardar was unimpressed with the slogans raised for socialism and spoke often of the need for India to create wealth before debating over what to do with it, how to share it.\n\nThe role he envisaged for the government was that of a welfare state but realised that other countries had taken up the task at more advanced stages of development.\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel rejected nationalisation completely and was against controls.\u00a0To him, the profit motive was a great stimulant to exertion, not a stigma.\n\nPatel was against people remaining idle. In 1950 he said, \u201cMillions of idle hands that have no work cannot find employment on machines\u201d.\u00a0He urged labourers to participate in creating wealth before claiming a just share.\n\nSardar championed investment-led growth. He said, \u201cSpend less, save more, and invest as much as possible should be the motto of every citizen.\n\nWas Patel against the partition of British India \u2013 into India and Pakistan?\n\nSardar in his early years opposed the partition of British India. However, he accepted the division of India by December 1946. Many including VP Menon and Abul Kalam Azad felt that Patel was more receptive to the idea of Partition than Nehru.\n\nAbul Kalam Azad was a staunch critic of Partition right till the very end, however, that was not the case with Patel and Nehru. Azad in his memoir\u00a0India wins Freedom\u00a0says that he was \u2018surprised and pained when Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in reply to why Partition was needed said that \u2018whether we liked it or not, there were two nations in India\u2019.\n\nSardar Patel as a defender of Hindu interests\n\nAccording to Raj Mohan Gandhi, one of Patel\u2019s most highly regarded biographers, Patel was the Hindu face of Indian nationalism. Nehru was the secular and global face of Indian nationalism. However, both worked under the same umbrella of the Indian National Congress.\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel was an open defender of Hindu interests. This however made Patel less popular among minorities.\n\nHowever, Patel was never communal. As Home Minister, he did his best to protect Muslim lives in Delhi during riots.\u00a0Patel had a Hindu heart (because of his upbringing) but he ruled with an impartial and secular hand.\n\nSardar Patel and RSS\n\nSardar Patel initially had a soft corner towards Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and their efforts in the Hindu interest. However, after the assassination of Gandhi, Sardar Patel banned RSS.\n\n\u201cAll their speeches were fill of communal poison\u201c, he wrote after banning the Sangh in 1948. \u201cAs a final result of the poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of the invaluable life of Gandhiji.\u201d\n\nThe ban on the RSS was eventually lifted on July 11, 1949, after Golwalkar agreed to make certain promises as conditions for the ban being revoked. In its communique announcing the lifting of the ban, the government of India said that the organisation and its leader had promised to be loyal to the constitution and the flag.\n\nStatue of Unity, a tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel?\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel was an Indian National Congress leader \u2013 until his death. Many historians like Ramchandra Guha, thinks\u00a0it is ironic that Patel is being claimed by the BJP when he \u201cwas himself a lifelong Congressman\u201d.\n\nCongress leader Shashi Tharoor alleged that BJP was trying to \u2018hijack\u2019 the legacy of freedom fighters and national heroes like Patel as they have no leaders of their own in history to celebrate.\n\nMany opposition leaders see vested interests in the right-wing party\u2019s effort to appropriate Patel and depict the Nehru family in a bad light.\n\nBuilt at a cost of\u00a0Rs.\u00a02,989 crore, the statue depicts Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India\u2019s first Home Minister, wearing a traditional dhoti and shawl, towering over the Narmada River.\n\nAt 182-metre, the statue is touted as the world\u2019s tallest \u2013 it is 177 feet higher than China\u2019s Spring Temple Buddha, currently the world\u2019s tallest statue.\n\nIron was collected from all over the country for the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, also known as the Iron Man of India.\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel\u2019s Quotes\n\n\u201cWork is worship but laughter is life. Anyone who takes life too seriously must prepare himself for a miserable existence. Anyone who greets joys and sorrows with equal facility can really get the best of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy culture is agriculture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe worked hard to achieve our freedom; we shall have to strive harder to justify it\u201d.\n\nConclusion\n\nPatel was a selfless leader, who placed the country\u2019s interests above everything else and shaped India\u2019s destiny with single-minded devotion.\n\nThe invaluable contribution of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in building a modern and unified India needs to be remembered by every Indian as the country marches ahead as one of the largest economies in the world."

He was later released and placed under House arrest in Calcutta.\n\nNetaji\u2019s Escape from India\n\n1941: Bose escaped house arrest in disguise and travelled out of India. He started garnering support from Nazi Germany and even met Adolf Hitler.\n\nHe founded the Free India Center in Berlin and created the Indian Legion (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa before their capture by Axis forces.\n\nBose was given the honorific title of Netaji in Germany in 1942 by the Indian soldiers of the Indian Legion and officials of the Special Bureau for India in Berlin.\n\n1942-43: World War II was underway, Nazi Germany was losing footing in the west. In the east Japanese were advancing rapidly.

His father, Debendranath Tagore was a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, a new religious sect in nineteenth-century Bengal which attempted a revival of the ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid down in the Upanishads.\n\nThe Tagore family was a treasure trove of talent in every field. They hosted the publication of literary magazines; theatre and recitals of Bengali and Western classical music featured there regularly. Tagore\u2019s father invited several professional musicians to stay in the house and teach\u00a0Indian Classical music to the children.\n\nTagore\u2019s oldest brother\u00a0Dwijendranath\u00a0was a philosopher and poet. Another brother,\u00a0Satyendranath, was the first Indian appointed to the formerly all-European\u00a0Indian Civil Service. Another brother,\u00a0Jyotitindranath, was a musician, composer, and playwright. His sister\u00a0Swarnakumari\u00a0became a novelist.\n\nAlso read: Modern Indian Sculpture\n\nEducation\n\nRabindra Nath Tagore had his initial education in Oriental Seminary School. But he did not like the conventional education and started studying at home under several teachers. He was mostly trained by his siblings both in literary as well as physical activities like gymnastics and martial arts.\n\nTagore was a child prodigy when it comes to writing as he has started writing and publishing poetry by the age of eight.\n\nIn 1873, at the age of eleven, Tagore and his father left Calcutta to tour India for several months. He visited his father\u2019s Santiniketan estate and Amritsar before reaching the Himalayan hill station of Dalhousie where he read biographies, studied history, astronomy, modern science, and Sanskrit, and examined the classical poetry of Kalidasa.\n\nAt the age of seventeen, he was sent to England for formal law schooling but he did not finish his studies there. He rather took up independent studies of Shakespeare.\n\nHe returned from England in 1880 and regularly published poems, stories, and novels in Bengali, slowly starting to transform Bengali literature.\n\nIn 1883, he married Mrinalini Devi, a child bride as was the tradition in those times.\n\nRabindranath Tagore in Santiniketan\n\nTagore moved to Santiniketan ashram in 1901, where he started an experimental school based on traditional guru-shishya teaching methods from the Upanishads. He hoped that the revival of the ancient methods of teaching will be more beneficial than the British imparted modern education system.\n\nHis wife and two of their children died during this time which left him distraught.\n\nAfter his return from England and during his stay in Santiniketan, Tagore wrote several literary works of poetry, stories, and novels. His works had started gaining immense popularity in India as well as abroad.\n\nIn 1909, Rabindranath Tagore started writing Gitanjali. In 1912, Tagore went to Europe for the second time. On the journey to London, he translated some of his poems/songs from Gitanjali to English. He met William Rothenstein, a noted British painter, in London who was impressed by the poems, made copies, and gave to Yeats and other English poets. Yeats was enthralled and later wrote the introduction to Gitanjali when it was published in September 1912 in a limited edition by the India Society in London. And in 1913, this collection of poems won the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was the first non-European to receive the prestigious award.\n\nIn 1915, he was awarded a knighthood by King George V.\n\nRabindranath Tagore in Independence movement\n\nTagore participated in the Indian nationalist movement from time to time, though in his own non-sentimental and visionary way; and Gandhi, the political father of modern India, was his devoted friend. Tagore came to be recognized as one of the architects of modern India.\n\nIndia\u2019s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, wrote in\u00a0Discovery of India, \u201cTagore and Gandhi have undoubtedly been the two outstanding and dominating figures in the first half of the twentieth century. Tagore\u2019s influence over the mind of India, and especially of successive rising generations has been tremendous. Not Bengali only, the language in which he wrote, but all the modern languages of India have been molded partly by his writings. More than any other Indian, he has helped to bring into harmony the ideals of the East and the West, and broadened the bases of Indian nationalism.\u201d\n\nIn 1905, Viceroy Curzon decided to divide Bengal into two parts. Rabindranath Tagore strongly protested against this decision. Tagore wrote many national songs and attended protest meetings. He initiated the Rakhibandhan ceremony, symbolizing the underlying unity of undivided Bengal.\n\nIn 1919, following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Tagore renounced his knighthood condemning the act. He was a supporter of Gandhiji but he stayed out of politics. He was opposed to nationalism and militarism as a matter of principle, and instead promoted spiritual values and the creation of a new world culture founded in multi-culturalism, diversity, and tolerance.\n\nTagore the educationalist\n\n1n 1921, Rabindranath Tagore established Viswabharati University and gave all his money from Nobel Prize and royalty money from his books to this University.\n\nTagore was quite knowledgeable of Western culture, especially Western poetry and sciences. Tagore had a good grasp of modern \u2013 post-Newtonian \u2013 physics and was well able to hold his own in a debate with Einstein in 1930 on the newly emerging principles of quantum mechanics and chaos.

Tagore also left numerous drawings and paintings, and songs for which he wrote the music himself.\n\nHe also played the title role in his first original dramatic piece- Valmiki Pratibha.\n\nDeath\n\nAfter an extended period of suffering, Tagore died on August 7, 1941, in the same mansion in which he was brought up.\n\nLegacy of Rabindranath Tagore:\n\nRabindranath Tagore changed the way Bengali literature was perceived as he left an everlasting impression on the readers.\n\nMany countries have his statues erected and host many yearly events to pay tribute to the legendary writer.\n\nMany of his works have been made global, thanks to a host of translations by many famous international writers.\n\nThere are five museums dedicated to Tagore.

He wrote under the pen name \u2018Azad\u2019, which later became his identity.\n\nIn 1912, Azad started publishing a weekly called\u00a0\u2018Al-Hilal\u2019 which he used to question British policies. The publication gained such immense popularity among the public that the British had to finally ban it in 1914 under the Press Act.\n\nAzad soon started another weekly,\u00a0\u2018Al-Balagh\u2019 which ran until he was booked under Defence of India Regulations in 1916. The governments of Bombay, Punjab, Delhi, and the United Provinces had banned his entry and he was deported to Bihar until 1920. Despite censoring, he found ways to rebel against British activities through the power of his pen.\n\nHe was a proponent of Hindu-Muslim unity and kept views that were radical and liberal for the Muslims of that time. He propagated his views through his writings and advocated for Indian nationalism and revolutionary ideas based on Hindu-Muslim unity.\n\nAbul Kalam Azad during the Independence movement\n\n1905: \u00a0Azad opposed the Bengal partition of 1905 and became increasingly active in revolutionary activities and was associated with revolutionaries like Aurobindo Ghosh and Shyam Sundar Chakravarty.\n\n1908: Azad\u2019s trip to Egypt, Syria, turkey, and France brought him in contact with many revolutionaries related to the Young Turk movement and the Iranian revolution. This developed and shaped his political views towards nationalism.\n\n1909: He objected to separate electorates for Muslims under the Morley-Minto reforms and wrote extensively against is it in his weekly Al-Hilal.\n\n1916: He was banned and deported to Bihar for his revolutionary writing until 1920. He was released after World War I.\n\n1920: After his release, Azad, already inspired by Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s philosophy of non-cooperation to fight the British, started leading the\u00a0Khilafat Movement, launched by Indian Muslims to demand that the British preserve the authority of the Ottoman Sultan as Caliph of Islam after World War I.\n\nHe supported the Non-cooperation Movement (1920-22) and entered the Indian National Congress during this time. He was elected the president of the All India Khilafat Committee.\n\n1923: At 35, he became the youngest person to become the president of the Indian National Congress.\n\nAzad grew close to Gandhi through their deep passion for religion and simple living. He began to spin his clothes using khadi on the charkha and began frequently living and participating in the ashrams organized by Gandhi. \u00a0Though deeply committed to non-violence himself, Azad also grew close to fellow nationalists like Jawaharlal Nehru, Chittaranjan Das, and Subhas Chandra Bose.\n\n1924: Azad served as president of the 1924 Unity Conference in Delhi, using his position to work to reunite the Swarajists and the Khilafat leaders under the common banner of the Congress.\n\nAzad served on the Congress Working Committee and in the offices of the general secretary and president many times.\n\n1928: Azad endorsed the Nehru Report, which was criticized by the Ali brothers and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Azad endorsed the ending of separate electorates and called for an independent India to be committed to secularism.\n\nAt the Congress session in\u00a0Guwahati, Azad endorsed Gandhi\u2019s call for\u00a0dominion\u00a0status for India within a year.\n\n1930: He participated in Salt Satyagraha and was arrested and jailed for a year and a half.

He was deeply affected by the violence witnessed during the Partition. Azad travelled through the violence-affected regions of Bengal, Assam, and Punjab and contributed to establishing the refugee camps and ensuring the supply of food and other basic resources.\n\nAbul Kalam Azad, the Educationalist\n\n\u2018Maulana\u2019, as Azad was fondly referred to, headed constituent assembly debates which went on to shape many of the policies, especially those related to education. He believed that India as a nation should aspire for high educational standards and never compromise on that count.\n\nHe was an intellectual at par and his dedication to the field of education is unparalleled as he envisages a liberal and humanitarian education system. His idea was a fusion of eastern and western concepts to bring about wholesome and integrated personality to the education system.\n\nIn 1920, Azad along with fellow Khilafat leaders M. A. Ansari and Ajmal Khan founded the Jamila Milia Islamia in Aligarh as higher education institute managed entirely by Indians without any British support.\n\nLife of Abul Kalam after independence\n\nAzad remained a close confidante, supporter, and advisor to prime minister Nehru, and played an important role in framing national policies. Azad masterminded the creation of national programs of school and college construction and spreading the enrolment of children and young adults into schools, to promote universal primary education.\n\nHe was elected to the Lok sabha in 1952 and 1957.\n\nAzad supported Nehru\u2019s socialist economic and industrial policies, as well as the advancing social rights and economic opportunities for women and underprivileged Indians.\n\nIn 1956, he served as president of the\u00a0UNESCO General Conference held in Delhi.\n\nMaulana Azad was strongly against leaving education to the states. He argued that education was a matter of grave importance and the central government should be given this authority to ensure a uniform national standard of education across the country.\n\nThough he was supported by Jawaharlal Nehru and other key members of the constituent assembly, a few felt this was a bad idea given the diversity of our country. They were of the view that a decentralized approach would enable states to make laws about education in their respective states. Ultimately, the issue was resolved by retaining education in the state list but also including entries related to higher education under the union list.\n\nEducation always remained an important issue for Azad.\u00a0On 16 January 1948, Azad had said in a meeting, \u201cWe must not for a moment forget, it is a birthright of every individual to receive at least the basic education without which he cannot fully discharge his duties as a citizen.\u201d\n\nHe also established \u2018the board for adult education to facilitate education among the uneducated adults.\n\nHe founded the Indian Council of Cultural Relations in 1950 to encourage cultural exchange with other nations.\n\nHe also played an important role in establishing the Sahitya Academy, Sangeet Natak Academy, and Lalit Kala Academy for the development of literature, music, dance, and painting respectively.\n\nAzad, the first education minister of independent India\n\nAs the first education minister of the country from 1947 to 1958, Abul Kalam Azad advocated for free and compulsory primary education for all children up to the age of 14 as he believed it was the right of all citizens.\n\nLater, he went on to establish the Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi in 1935 from Aligarh and contributed to the setting up of the IITs, IISc, and School of Planning and Architecture.\n\nHe was also one of the brains behind the University Grants Commission, India\u2019s higher education regulator, and played a key role in the establishment of other educational institutions.\n\nLiterary works by Azad\n\nHe wrote many books like India wins Freedom, Gubhar-e-Khatir, Tazkirah, Tarjumanul Quran, etc.\n\nDeath of Abul Kalam Azad\n\nThe scholar-politician passed away on 22 February 1958.\n\nLegacy of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad\n\nMaulana Abul Kalam Azad was a strong believer in the co-existence of all religious communities.\n\nHis contributions to the field of education in India are incomparable, hence his birthday, 11 November, is celebrated as National Education Day.\n\nIn 1992, he was posthumously conferred the Bharat Ratna, India\u2019s highest civilian award.\n\nThe Ministry of Minority Affairs of the Central Government of India set up the Maulana Azad Education Foundation in 1989 on the occasion of his birth centenary to promote education amongst educationally backward sections of the Society.\n\nThe Ministry also provides the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad National Fellowship, an integrated five-year fellowship in the form of financial assistance to students from minority communities to pursue higher studies such as M.

Their goal was to improve the quality of education for the youth of India.\n\n1884: Deccan Education Society was set up by them to further their goal of educating the youth to make them proficient in English and nationalistic ideology along with Indian culture. Tilak and his associates considered English to be a powerful tool for the dissemination of liberal and democratic ideals.\n\n1885: The society established the Fergusson college in Pune for post-secondary studies. Tilak taught Mathematics here for a while.\n\n1890: Tilak resigned from society and joined the newly formed Congress.\n\nBal Gangadhar Tilak: The Journalist and Politician\n\nTilak turned his attention to public affairs and started two weekly newspapers to awaken the political consciousness of the people-\n\nKesari (in Marathi)\nThe Mahratta (in English)\n\nHe wanted to widen the popularity of the nationalist movement which was mostly confined to the upper classes by introducing the Hindu religious symbolism and invoking Maratha sentiments and traditions of the Maratha struggle against Mughals.\n\nTo build anti-imperialist sentiments he wrote about celebrating the Ganapathi festival and Shivaji festival on large scale.\n\nHe also started akharas, lathi clubs for involving youth more, and anti cow killing societies.\n\n1897: He was prosecuted for sedition for his writings against the provisions of the Epidemic act 1897 for tackling the bubonic plague that had engulfed the Pune region.\n\nTilak had targeted Commissioner Rand, and his writings incited two youth, the Chapekar brothers, in murdering Rand.\nThe trial and sentence of this case earned him the title of \u201cLokmanya\u201d (beloved leader of the people).\nHe was sentenced to 18 months in prison, where he developed his ideas of swaraj for the first time.\n\nTilak\u2019s idea of swaraj was gaining popularity and he became a very important extremist leader of congress in the time being.\n\n1905: Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal- Tilak strongly opposed this move and supported the Bengali demand for annulment of the act. He advocated for the boycott of British goods, which soon became the Swadeshi movement.\n\n1906: Tilak put forward a program of passive resistance\u2013 \u2018Tenets of the new party\u2019 in front of the Congress-to prepare people to sacrifice to gain independence. This form of resistance was later adopted by Gandhiji against the British,\n\n1907: The moderate leaders did not agree to such political actions which led to the Surat split between the moderates and extremists.\n\nThe era of extremists (1905-1917)\n\nBal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Bipin Chandra Pal\u2013 known as the Lal, Bal, Pal\u2013 were the extremist leaders whose writings instilled many revolutionary activities in the country.\n\nLeaders like Aurobindo Ghosh were also related to them and a few secret societies like Anushilan Samiti in Bengal came up during the period.\n\nTilak through his newspapers wrote criticisms against British rule and the moderate nationalists who advocated social reforms along western lines and political reforms along constitutional lines.\n\nHe was against social reforms through the interference of the British rather, he believed that social reforms should be done after the Indians get to self-rule. This view of him caused him to oppose the \u2018age of consent act\u2019 of 1891.\n\n1908: The Surat split of 1907 helped the British government take advantage of the division and again charged Tilak with sedition and inciting terrorism.\n\nHe had defended the actions of Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki wherein they had tried to assassinate district judge Mr. Kingsford in Bengal using bombs.\nTilak was deported to Mandalay, Burma, to serve a six-year prison sentence.\nThe poor conditions of the jail had a bad impact on his health and he was released in 1914.\n\nTilak\u2019s politics had mellowed down after this, which was evident in his support of the British government in World War I, he had also given speeches to encourage youth to support British war efforts.\n\n1916: He established the All India Home rule league in Belgaum with the slogan \u201cSwarajya is my birthright and I shall have it\u201d.\n\nIt worked in Maharashtra (except Bombay), the central provinces, Karnataka, and Berar.\n\nHe also collaborated with the Home Rule organization started by Annie Besant in Madras.\n\nHe rejoined the Congress in 1916 in the Lucknow session, and his good relation with Mohammed Ali Jinnah led to the historic Lucknow Pact between the Muslim League and Congress.\n\n1918: Tilak visited England as the president of the Indian home rule league and garnered support and good relations of the labour party which was emerging as a major stakeholder in British politics.\n\nAlso read: Lucknow Pact\n\nTilak vs Chirol (1919)\nValentine Chirol the editor of London times had published a set of articles in 1910 in a book called \u2018The Indian unrest\u2019 in which he called Tilak the \u201cFather of Indian unrest\u201d.\nTilak filed a defamation court against Chirol in the court of London in 1919- he lost the case.

As a politician, an economist, a lawyer, and a teacher, Tilak was truly the \u201cMaker of Modern India\u201d as Mahatma Gandhi rightly called him."

Initially, he supported Mahatma Gandhi and the Non-Cooperation Movement. However, when Gandhi withdrew the movement in the wake of the Chauri Chaura incident, Bhagat Singh turned to revolutionary nationalism.\n\nBhagat singh was deeply affected by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (1919) and the violence against unarmed Akali protestors at Nankana Sahib (1921).\n\nIn 1924 in Kanpur, he\u00a0became a member of the Hindustan Republican Association,\u00a0started by\u00a0Sachindranath Sanyal a year earlier. The main organizer of the Association was Chandra Shekhar Azad and Bhagat Singh became very close to him.\n\nIn 1926, he founded the\u00a0Naujawan Bharat Sabha, an organization that aimed to encourage revolution against British rule by rallying the peasants and workers.\n\nHe made contact with the \u2018Workers and Peasants Party\u2019 which brought out the monthly magazine Kirti in Punjabi. For the next year, Bhagat Singh worked on the editorial board of Kirti.\n\nIn 1928, he established the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) along with Sukhdev, Chandrashekhar Azad, and others.\n\nHSRA collapsed after Chandrashekar Azad was shot dead in 1930.\n\nBhagat Singh\u2019s Revolutionary activities\n\nHis association with revolutionaries began with HSRA. He was introduced to the philosophy of bombs and the importance of the armed revolution.\n\nIn 1927, he was first\u00a0arrested on charges of association with the Kakori Case\u00a0accused of an article written under the pseudonym Vidrohi (Rebel).\n\nHe was also accused of being responsible for a bomb explosion at Lahore during the Dussehra fair.\n\nThe Saunders Case/ Lahore Conspiracy case:\n\nIn 1928, Lala Lajpat rai died due to injuries sustained during a protest against the Simon Commission in Lahore. The lathi-charge was ordered by the superintendent of police James Scott.\n\nBhagat Singh and his revolutionary friends decided to avenge the death of the dear leader. However, in a case of mistaken identity, they assassinated another police official J P Saunders. This was known as the\u00a0Lahore Conspiracy Case.\n\nAfter this incident, Bhagat Singh fled from Lahore and made changed his appearance to avoid arrest.\n\nThe murder was condemned as a retrograde action by Mahatma Gandhi, but Jawaharlal Nehru later wrote:\n\n\u201cBhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honor of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol, the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name. Innumerable songs grew about him and the popularity that the man achieved was something amazing.\u201d\n\nCentral assembly bombing case:\n\nOn 8th April 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw a bomb in the Central Assembly at Delhi, from the Visitors\u2019 Gallery. They also threw pamphlets and raised pro-revolutionary slogans.\n\nBoth the revolutionaries did not resist arrest since they wanted to spread their message of revolution and anti-imperialism and wanted to use the trial as a platform for it.\n\nThey shouted slogans of \u201cInquilab Zindabad\u201d during the whole arrest. The slogan became quite popular among the youth and many freedom fighters.\n\nThere were no causalities in the incident as it was never their intention to cause physical harm to anyone. Their aim was \u2018to make the deaf hear\u2019.\n\nBhagat Singh was the mastermind behind the incident and was inspired by Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist, who was executed by France for a similar incident in Paris.\n\nIn the trial for the incident, both Singh and Dutt were sentenced to imprisonment for life.\n\nBy this time Bhagat Singh was also linked to the JP Saunder\u2019s murder incident. He, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev was charged with the murder of Saunders.\n\nThe trial and death of Bhagat Singh\n\nThe trial started in July 1929 and was published in daily newspapers.\n\nThe young revolutionaries started a hunger strike in Lahore prison demanding better conditions for political prisoners who were also treated as criminals.\n\nThey were met by many leaders including Jawaharlal Nehru while they fasted for 116 days which only ended after repeated requests from family and congress leaders.\n\nBut the trial was a one-sided affair and Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were sentenced to death. The verdict was met with large criticism and many national leaders requested to reduce the sentence but in vain.\n\nThe three were ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931 but the sentence was carried out a day earlier at the Lahore Jail. After the hanging, their mortal remains were cremated in secret.\n\nThe executions were reported widely by the press, especially as they took place on the eve of the annual convention of the Congress party in Karachi. Gandhi faced black flag demonstrations by angry youths who shouted: \u201cDown with Gandhi\u201d.\n\nIndividual Heroism vs Mass Movement\n\nBhagat Singh initially believed in individual heroism to achieve the goal.\n\nHowever, he later realised that individual heroism stood no chance against the brute force of the British empire and the\u00a0only way to a successful revolution was to unleash a popular broad-based movement.\n\nLegacy of Bhagat Singh\n\nEvery year,\u00a0March 23\u00a0is observed as\u00a0Martyrs\u2019 Day\u00a0as a\u00a0tribute to freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar, and Shivaram Rajguru. The day is also known as\u00a0Shaheed Diwas or Sarvodaya Day.\n\nDuring the centenary of his birth, a group of intellectuals sets up an institution named Bhagat Singh Sansthan to commemorate him and his ideals.\n\nHe was an atheist and ardent reader- his book \u201cWhy I am an Athiest\u201d is quite popular.\n\nFew of his famous quotes were-\n\nThey may kill me but they cannot kill my ideas. They can crush my body, but they will not be able to crush my spirit.\nBombs and pistols do not make a revolution. The sword of revolution is sharpened on the whetting stone of ideas.\nMay the sun in his course visit no land freer, happier, more lovely, than this our own country.\nBut mere faith and blind faith is dangerous: it dulls the brain and makes a man reactionary.\nRevolution is an inalienable right of mankind. Freedom is an imperishable birthright of all. Labour is the real sustainer of society.\n\nThe youth of India still gain inspiration in his life- a young revolutionary with fire in his blood and calm in his heart."

He enrolled there at \u2018Gray\u2019s Inn Law College\u2019.\n\nThe professional and political life of Veer Savarkar\n\nHe was greatly inspired by leaders like\u00a0Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Bipin Chandra Pal and by the protests against the partition of Bengal and the Swadeshi movement.\n\nHe was a staunch patriot who was involved in political activities at high school and college and was attracted to radical views and movements. He and his brother Ganesh Damodar Savarkar founded a secret society called\u00a0\u2018Mitra Mela\u2019 in 1899 which later became \u2018Abhinav Bharat Society\u2019 in 1904.\n\nIn London, he established the Free India Society along with Madam Bhikaji Cama to organize students to fight for India\u2019s independence through a revolution.\n\nSavarkar was a friend and guide to Madan Lal Dhingra who assassinated Curzon Wyllie, a British army officer. Even though Dhingra was executed by the British, Savarkar continued the further revolution.\n\nThe History of the War of Indian Independence\n\n1909: During this time, he authored a book\u00a0\u201cThe History of the War of Indian Independence\u201d.\n\nIt was Veer Savarkar who first named the 1857 rebellion the first war of independence. He\u00a0referred to British rule as unjust and oppressive.\n\nThe book was banned by the British, but\u00a0Madam Bhikaji Cama published the book in the Netherlands, Germany, and France, which eventually gained popularity among many Indian revolutionaries.\n\nHe also led an armed revolt against the Morley-Minto reforms during this time.\n\nArrest and mercy petitions\n\nIn 1910, Savarkar was arrested and ordered to be extradited to India for his connections with the revolutionary group India House.\n\nOn return to India, Savarkar was sentenced to two life terms of imprisonment totalling 50 years and was moved to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 1911.\n\nHe filed multiple mercy petitions and his release was also demanded by national leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Tilak.\n\nIn 1921, he was transferred to a jail in Ratnagiri and then to the Yerwada Jail in Pune.\n\nHe was released in 1924 but could not move out of Ratnagiri or engage in political activities for five years.\n\nEssentials of Hindutva\n\nDuring his incarceration in Ratnagiri jail in 1922, he wrote his \u201cEssentials of Hindutva\u201d that formulated his theory of Hindutva.\n\nHe was a self-proclaimed atheist but a staunch believer of Hindutva and he believed all the religions are the same and can come together to form the Akhand Bharat (Unified or Great India).\n\nHe later joined Tilak\u2019s Swaraj Party and gave instigating patriotic speeches against the British Government. As a result,\u00a0the British Government withdrew his B.A. degree.\n\nHe advocated for the use of Hindi as a national language. He also fought against untouchability and caste-based discrimination.\n\nSavarkar\u2019s contributions as a social reformer\n\nSavarkar built Patit Pavan Mandir in the Ratnagiri district to allow entry to all Hindus, including Dalits.\n\nAccording to Savarkar, the rigid caste system \u201cdeserves to be thrown into the dustbins of history\u201d.\n\nSavarkar wanted to break away from caste-based vocational rigidity and encourage persons to pursue any vocation of their choice based on aptitude and ability. In the absence of motivation of competition, or lack of aptitude, Savarkar believed, \u201cmerely following what one\u2019s father did, will make one both complacent and unproductive.\u201d\n\nSavarkar wanted to break away from the taboo on inter-caste dining. He had said, \u201cReligion is in the heart, the soul, the spirit; not the stomach!\u201d He also promoted inter-caste marriage.\n\nVeer Savarkar wanted to popularize Vedic literature to everyone, not only to a particular caste. He called Vedic literature civilizational knowledge for the entire human race and India\u2019s unique gift to mankind.\n\nSavarkar believed in global mobility and the need for Indians to venture out into foreign lands so as to \u201cbring back the best of the world and carry the fragrance of India and her culture to every corner of the globe.\u201d\n\nVeer Savarkar underscored was the need to develop a scientific temper. \u201cWe are 200 years behind Europe\u201d, he had remarked adding, \u201cIt is through science, modern thoughts and industrialization that we can ensure that every man woman in India will have a job to do, food to eat, clothes to wear and a happy life to lead.\u201d\n\nSavarkar and Hindu Mahasabha\n\nIn 1937, Savarkar became the president of the Hindu Mahasabha (till 1943).\n\nIt was founded by Veer Damodar Savarkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, Madan Mohan Malviya in 1933.\n\nThe organization was formed to protect the rights of the Hindu community, after the formation of the All India Muslim League in 1906 and the British India government\u2019s creation of a separate Muslim electorate under the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909.\n\nSavarkar as president of the Hindu Mahasabha decided to support the British war effort in India seeking military training for the Hindus during the Second World War.\n\nHe gave the slogan \u201cHinduize all Politics and Militarize Hindudom\u201d.\n\nOpposing stand during the Quit India Movement\n\nUnder Savarkar, the Hindu Mahasabha openly opposed the call for the Quit India Movement and boycotted it officially. He asked all the Hindu sabha members in the government to support the British government instead.\n\nHindu Mahasabha also opposed Gandhi\u2019s initiative to hold talks with Jinnah in 1944. Savarkar strongly attacked the British and Congress for making concessions for the Muslim separatists.\n\nAfter the resignation of the Congress ministries in protest of Linlithgow\u2019s decision to drag India into WWII without their consultation, the Hindu Mahasabha, under Savarkar\u2019s presidency, joined hands with the Muslim League and other parties to form governments, in certain provinces like Sindh, NWFP, and Bengal.\n\nThe \u2018two nations in one country\u2019 theory\n\nWhen he gave \u2018the two nations in one country\u2019 theory, he propounded that the Hindus and Muslims, though different can bury their differences and unite for India.\n\nThat\u2019s the reason he had opposed INC\u2019s acceptance of the partition of India. Note: The two nations theory adopted by Jinnah was given by Sir Syed Ahmed khan.\n\nThe assassination of Mahatma Gandhi: The charge and acquittal\n\nIn 1948, he was charged as the co-conspirator for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nNathuram Godse was a member of Hindu Mahasabha and a prolific follower of Savarkar\u2019s ideas.\n\nSavarkar was however later acquitted from the charge due to lack of evidence.\n\nPost-Independence India and Savarkar\n\nHe was under the constant scrutiny of the public after Gandhiji\u2019s assassination.\n\nLater, he was also arrested by the government for making \u201cHindu nationalist speeches\u201d but was released after agreeing to give up political activities. He continued addressing the social and cultural elements of Hindutva.\n\nAfter the death of his wife in 1963, from February 1966, Savarkar gave up consuming food, water, and medicines. According to him, giving up life when one was no longer useful to society was better than waiting for death.\n\nHe died on February 26, 1966, due to ill health.\n\nLegacy of Veer Savarkar:\n\nSavarkar was the first political leader to set independence as India\u2019s goal in the 1900s. Almost immediately after joining college, he had started organizing and spreading his anti-British and revolutionary ideas through his efficient oratory and writing skills.\n\nHe was also known as Swantantryaveer or Veer Savarkar which was earned due to his courageous behaviour.\n\nHe was a proponent of a united India, which was inclusive and diverse \u2014 an India that was an organic result of all its diverse cultures. He believed in the idea of inclusivity for mobilizing the Indian masses.\n\nSavarkar also openly embraced the \u201cEra of Machines\u201d and warned the Indian leaders to learn from Europe\u2019s mistakes.\n\nHis futuristic approach to Indian cinema, too, was commendable. He believed in the innovative spirit of the human mind.\n\nEven though his ideology on Hindu Rashtra and Hindutva is controversial, Savarkar\u2019s ideas of modernity, social and religious reforms, cultivation of scientific temper, and embracing technological tools continue to be relevant for building a new India.\n\nSome of his other literary works include:\n\nSix Glorious Epochs of Indian History\nMy Transportation for Life\nKale Pani\n1857 che Svatantrya Samar\nMaazi Janmathep\nMoplyanche Banda (about Moplah rebellion of 1921)\nHindu Rashtra Darshan"

He later created a faith called \u2018Birsait\u2019 and many tribals joined his faith which became a hindrance to British conversion activities.\n\nDuring the 1880s, Birsa observed the Sardari Larai movement in the region, which demanded the restoration of tribal rights through non-violent methods like sending petitions to the Raj. But the oppressive colonial regime paid no heed to these demands and the zamindari system soon reduced the tribals from landowners to laborers.\n\nThe feudal setup escalated the forced labor (veth bigari) in the forested tribal areas.\n\nBirsa Munda took up the fight for the tribals through the religious domain and stood up against the Christian missionaries. He worked to reform religious practices, discouraged many superstitious rites, brought in new tenets, and prayers, and worked to restore tribal pride.\n\nBirsa emphasized the importance of \u201csirmare firun raja jai\u201d or \u201cvictory to the ancestral king\u201d invoking the sovereignty of the tribals\u2019 ancestral autonomous control over the land. He also stressed monogamy in the later stage of his life.\n\nBirsa Munda\u2019s Ulgulan\n\nBirsa became a mass leader and began to be considered Bhagwan and Dharati Aba by his followers. He ignited the minds of the masses- the Mundas, Oraons, other Adivasis and non-Adivasis responded to his call and joined the \u201cUlgulan\u201d (great tumult) or revolt against the colonial power and exploitative dikus (1899-1900).\n\nBirsa asked the people not to pay any rent and attacked the outposts of feudal, missionary, and colonial authorities.\n\nThe tribals of Central and Eastern India waged an effective armed resistance against the British with traditional bows and arrows, but only the real exploiters were attacked, and the common people were not troubled.\n\nBirsa Munda was captured by British police and lodged in jail at the age of 25, where he died in captivity on June 9, 1900.\n\nBut Bhagwan Birsa Munda\u2019s spirited struggle did not go in vain as it compelled the British to take action on the plight and exploitation of tribals, which resulted in the Chhota Nagpur Tenancy Act of 1908 for their protection.\n\nThis Act restricted the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals and became landmark legislation for the protection of tribal rights. The British regime also took steps to abolish Veth Bigari or forced labor.\n\nSoon after his death, the movement died, but fact remains that he was the one to mobilize the tribal community against the British and forced the colonial authorities to introduce laws protecting the land rights of the tribals.\n\nOther tribal uprisings against colonial rule:\n\nAlso read: Popular revolts and uprisings against the British\n\nPahariya rebellion (1778)\n\nThis took place in Raj mahal hills (present-day Jharkhand) against the British encroachment on tribal lands. The rebellion forced the East India Company to declare their territory autonomous, which was later known as the \u201cDaman-i-Koh\u201d area.\n\nChuar uprising/ Revolt of the jungle mahal (1766-72 and 1795-1816)\n\nChuars were the aboriginal tribes of jungle mahal (present-day West Bengal) and they also stood up to English encroachments in their territory.\n\nKhasi revolt (1829)\n\nThe Khasis revolted against the construction of a road from Brahmaputra valley to Sylhet by EIC, because this project increased the inflow of outsiders, threatening their tribal autonomy.\n\nKol mutiny (1831)\n\nThe Kols of the Chhota Nagpur area protested against their lands being transferred to outsiders by the English to increase the land revenue.\n\nKhond uprisings (1837-56)\n\nThe Khond, Gumsar, and Kalahandi tribes of eastern ghats (present-day Odisha and Andhra Pradesh) rose against the attempt by the government to suppress human sacrifice (Mariah), the introduction of new taxes by the British, and the influx of Zamindars and sahookars (money-lenders) into their area.\n\nBhils and Koli uprising (1817-48)\n\nThe Bhils were concentrated in the hill ranges of Khandesh in the Maratha territories of Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh. British occupation of this region in 1818 brought in the outsiders who dislocated the local community life. Similarly, the Kolis of Ahmednagar district, also challenged the British in 1829 but were quickly subdued by a large army contingent.\n\nRamosi uprising (1822-41)\n\nRamosis were the hill tribes of western ghats who were recruited as soldiers in the Maratha army. The main cause of the uprising was their disbanding by the British after the decline of Marathas.\u00a0The British later pacified the movement by taking them into their armies.\n\nSanthal revolt/ Santhal hool (1855-56)\n\nThe Santhal, who lived in the area between Bhagalpur and Rajmahal, known as Daman-i-Koh, rose in revolt; made a determined attempt to expel the outsiders (the dikus), and proclaimed the complete end of the foreign regime. The Santhal Paragana tenancy act of 1876 finally made it illegal to transfer Santhal land to a non- Santhal.\n\nRampa rebellion (1922)\n\nThe Rampa Rebellion against the British was organized by the tribal people of Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts to revolt against the foreigners\u2019 encroachment on their lands.\n\nIndia\u2019s freedom struggle was strengthened by several tribal communities such as Mundas, Oraons, Santhals, Tamars, Kols, Bhils, Khasis, Koyas, and Mizos, to name a few.

He witnessed the repression by British officers, who forced the tribals into harsh labour and imposed high yearly revenue tax on every household. Gaidinliu was at the forefront of the Heraka movement.\n\nIn 1931, Jadonang was arrested by the British and after a mock trial and was hanged for opposing the colonial rule on 29 August 1931. To ensure the movement does not die down with Jadonang, Gaidinliu took up the mantle from her cousin.\n\nShe linked her spiritual role as a leader of the socio-religious movement to her role as a nationalist and constantly evoked Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s efforts at the national level to inspire her people to rebel against the British.\n\nGaidinliu began her version of the Non-cooperation Movement among Naga tribes.

Read here to know more about his life.\n\nBhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 \u2013 6 December 1956), popularly known as Babasaheb, was an Indian jurist, economist, politician, and social reformer who Chaired the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly and was India\u2019s First Minister for Law and Justice.\n\nHe is known as the maker and conscience keeper of modern India. He was also the chairman of the drafting committee of the constitution of India.\n\nA pioneering social reformer, jurist, economist, author, polyglot orator, a scholar of comparative religions, and thinker Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the principal architect of the Indian Constitution and independent India\u2019s first law minister, was a multi-faceted man who remapped the frontiers of human achievement by his sheer tenacity, perseverance and the will to excel against all odds.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe early life of B.R Ambedkar\nAmbedkar\u2019s fight against untouchability\nPoona Pact, 1932:\nAmbedkar\u2019s political journey\nMaker and conscience-keeper of modern India\nThe drafting of India\u2019s constitution:\nDeath:\nLegacy of Babasaheb Ambedkar\nBooks by Ambedkar\nThe early life of B.R Ambedkar\n\nBorn into the Hindu Mahar caste, which was scorned as \u201cuntouchable\u201d by the upper class of the time, Babasaheb did not allow the limitations of his background to come in the way of acquiring first-rate education and pushing the bar for academic excellence. He earned a law degree from Lincoln\u2019s Inn and doctorates from Columbia University in the US and the London School of Economics, carving a place of eminence as a scholar extraordinaire for his research in law, economics, and political science. His early career saw him donning many hats: economist, professor, and lawyer.\n\nAmbedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar) (now in Madhya Pradesh).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAmbedkar\u2019s ancestors had long worked for the\u00a0army\u00a0of the\u00a0British East India Company, and his father served in the\u00a0British Indian Army\u00a0at the Mhow cantonment.\n\nHe faced casteism as a child during his school years- he and other such children weren\u2019t allowed to sit inside the class.\n\nAmbedkar was a bright child and excelled in his studies. In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year, he entered Elphinstone College, which was affiliated with the University of Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar caste to do so.\n\nBy 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University and was prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government.\n\nIn 1913, at the age of 22, Ambedkar was awarded a Baroda State Scholarship for three years under a scheme established by\u00a0Sayajirao Gaekwad III\u00a0(Gaekwad\u00a0of\u00a0Baroda) that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at\u00a0Columbia University\u00a0in\u00a0New York City.\n\nIn 1916, he passed his second M.A and later completed his Ph.D. in economics from Columbia in 1927.\n\nEven after being highly educated, the issue of untouchability issues his life in India after his return. He was unsuccessful at various jobs, even as a professor due to others objecting to his lower caste.\n\nAmbedkar\u2019s fight against untouchability\n\nIn the next stage, he emerged as a national leader with a pan-India vision of modernity underpinned by the ideals of social justice and equality. As India\u2019s freedom movement gained traction, he harnessed his formidable intellectual energies to script an anthem of an inclusive India and strove tirelessly for political rights and social freedom for Dalits and marginalized groups.\n\nIn 1923, he set up the\u2019Bahishkrit Hitkarini Sabha (Outcastes Welfare Association)\u2019,\u00a0which was devoted to spreading education and culture amongst the downtrodden.\n\nBy 1927, Ambedkar had decided to launch active movements against\u00a0untouchability. He began with public movements and marches to open up public drinking water resources.\n\nHe also began a struggle for the right to enter Hindu temples.\n\nIn a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly condemned the classic Hindu text, the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying caste discrimination and \u201cuntouchability\u201d, and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient text.\n\nPoona Pact, 1932:\n\nIn 1932, the British colonial government announced the formation of a separate electorate for \u201cDepressed Classes\u201d in the\u00a0Communal Award.\u00a0Mahatma Gandhi\u00a0fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community.\n\nGandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the Yerwada Central Jail of Poona. Following the fast, congressional politicians organized joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada.\n\nOn 25 September 1932, the agreement, known as the\u00a0Poona Pact\u00a0was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and\u00a0Madan Mohan Malaviya\u00a0(on behalf of the other Hindus).\n\nThe agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures within the general electorate.\n\nThe text used the term \u201cDepressed Classes\u201d to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the India Act 1935 and the later Indian Constitution of 1950.\n\nAmbedkar\u2019s political journey\n\nIn 1936, Ambedkar founded the\u00a0Independent Labour Party, which contested the 1937 Bombay election to the\u00a0Central Legislative Assembly\u00a0for the 13 reserved and 4 general seats, and secured 11 and 3 seats respectively.\n\nAmbedkar published his book\u00a0Annihilation of Caste on 15 May 1936. It strongly criticized Hindu orthodox religious leaders and the caste system in general and included \u201ca rebuke of Gandhi\u201d on the subject.\n\nIn 1937, Ambedkar tabled a bill in the Bombay Legislative Assembly aimed at abolishing the\u00a0khoti\u00a0system by creating a direct relationship between government and farmers.\n\nAmbedkar served on the Defence Advisory Committee and the Viceroy\u2019s Executive Council as minister for labour.\n\nAfter the\u00a0Lahore resolution\u00a0(1940) of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled\u00a0Thoughts on Pakistan, which analyzed the concept of \u201cPakistan\u201d in all its aspects.\n\nAmbedkar argued that the Hindus should concede Pakistan to the Muslims. Ambedkar also criticized Islamic practice in South Asia. While justifying the Partition of India, he condemned child marriage and the mistreatment of women in Muslim society.\nMaker and conscience-keeper of modern India\n\nBabasaheb, as he was fondly called by friends, admirers, and followers, braved the walls of prejudice and caste discrimination in early 20th century India to emerge as an exemplar and an unflinching crusader against the inequities of the caste system and socio-economic deprivation that afflicted millions of Indians.\n\nHis life is an inspirational story of achievements despite trying circumstances and the indomitable will to move beyond individual strife for the larger cause of social justice and national renaissance.\n\nThe drafting of India\u2019s constitution:\n\nIndia\u2019s tryst with destiny, as India\u2019s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru spoke eloquently about at the fateful hour of India\u2019s independence, saw Dr. Ambedkar being entrusted with a monumental responsibility: he was appointed Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee on August 29, 1947.\n\nHe fashioned a pluralistic and inclusive Constitution that guides and animates India to this day, guaranteeing equal opportunity and freedom of expression and faith for all citizens in a secular democracy.\n\nFamous scholar Granville Austin has evoked the revolutionary spirit of Dr. Ambdekar that is reflected in the Indian Constitution. \u201cThe majority of India\u2019s constitutional provisions are either directly arrived at furthering the aim of social revolution or attempt to foster this revolution by establishing conditions necessary for its achievement,\u201d wrote Austin.\n\nThe Constitution, drafted under Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s leadership, abolished untouchability and outlawed all forms of discrimination.\n\nAn ardent proponent of the rights of women, minorities, and the socially underprivileged, he argued eloquently and won the Constituent Assembly\u2019s support for introducing a system of reservations of jobs in the civil services, schools, and colleges for members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Class.\n\nThis was later reflected in the policies of affirmative action adopted by the Indian government.\n\nAn erudite economist and institution-builder, Dr. Ambedkar authored many scholarly treatises on economics and was the driving force behind the establishment of the Finance Commission of India. His ideas also laid the foundation for the setting up of India\u2019s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nWhile Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s achievements were manifold and straddled a wide spectrum, his inner life was richer and marked by spiritual vitality. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism.\n\nDeath:\n\nHe died in 1956 in New Delhi while working on \u201cThe Buddha and his Dhamma\u201d, which was published posthumously.\n\nThe popularity and esteem he enjoyed among all lovers of social justice were seen at his funeral at Dadar Chowpatty beach on December 7, 1956, which was thronged by at least half a million mourners.\n\nLegacy of Babasaheb Ambedkar\n\nBabasaheb\u2019s myriad contributions to the forging of a modern inclusive India were recognized posthumously through the Bharat Ratna in 1990.\n\nDr. Ambedkar\u2019s ideals of social inequality redesigned the contours of Indian politics. His surging popularity was reflected in scholarly biographies, numerous statues, and memorials across the country.\n\nToday, Ambedkar is revered nationally, and figures in the national pantheon as one of the makers of modern India, along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Tagore.\n\nHis birthday, April 14, has been christened \u2018Ambedkar Jayanti\u2019 or \u2018Bhim Jayanti\u2019 and is celebrated as a public holiday.\n\nAs India celebrates the birth anniversary of this national icon, Babasaheb remains an inspiration for millions of Indians and proponents of equality and social justice across the globe.\n\nFittingly, although it\u2019s a matter of coincidence, one can see the trace of Babasaheb\u2019s radiant vision in the \u201cSustainable Development Goals\u201d that are set to be formally adopted by the UN General Assembly to eliminate poverty, hunger, and socio-economic inequality by 2030.\n\nBooks by Ambedkar\nThe Problem of the Rupee \u2013 Its origin and its solution\nThe Untouchables, Who are they?\nWho were the Shudra?\nStates and Minorities\nEmancipation of the Untouchables"

Over the years, this area was under the control of Hindu rulers, Muslim emperors, Sikhs, Afghans, and Britishers.\n\nDuring the period before AD 1000, Kashmir was an important center of Buddhism and Hinduism. Many dynasties like\u00a0Gonanditya,\u00a0Karkota, and Lohara ruled Kashmir and surrounding areas of North-western India.\n\nThe Hindu dynasty rule which extended until 1339 was replaced by the Muslim rule by\u00a0Shah Mir\u00a0who became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the\u00a0Shah Mir dynasty. A few centuries later, the last independent ruler Yusuf Shah Chak was deposed by the Mugul emperor Akbar the Great.\n\nAkbar conquered Kashmir in 1587, making it part of the Mughal Empire. Subsequently, the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb expanded the empire further.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThus, it can be seen that under the Mughal rule, which extended nearly all of the Indian subcontinent, Kashmir was an integral part of India \u2013 however, not an independent nation.\n\nAlso read: Ladakh Statehood\n\nKashmir Region \u2013 After the Mughals\n\nAurangzeb\u2019s successors were weak rulers. Later Mughals failed to retain Kashmir. After Mughal rule, it passed to Afghan, Sikh, and Dogra rule.\n\nIn 1752, Kashmir was seized by the Afghan ruler\u00a0Ahmed Shah Abdali. The Afghan\u00a0Durrani Empire ruled Kasmir from the 1750s until 1819 when Sikhs, under\u00a0Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir and ended the Muslim rule.\n\nBy the early 19th century, Sikhs under Maharaja Renjith Singh took control of Kashmir. He had earlier annexed Jammu. The\u00a0Sikhs\u00a0ruled Kashmir until they were defeated by the British (First Anglo-Sikh War) in 1846.\n\nAfter that Kashmir became a princely state of the British Empire \u2013 under the Dogra Dynasty.\n\nJammu and Kashmir \u2013 as a princely state of the British Empire\n\nMaharaja Gulab Singh of the Dogra Dynasty signed the\u00a0\u2018Treaty of Amritsar\u2019 with the British East India Company in 1846. Under this treaty,\u00a0he paid Rs. 75 lakhs to the East India Company in 1846 in exchange for Kashmir and some other areas.\u00a0Jammu and Kashmir as a single entity was unified and founded (1846).\n\nZorawar Singh, a General in the Dogra Anny later led many campaigns in the northern areas like Ladakh, Baltistan, Gilgit, Hunza, and Yagistan, consolidating smaller principalities. He expanded the dominions of Maharaja Gulab Singh.\n\nHowever, Jammu and Kashmir, from 1846 until 1947, remained a princely state ruled by the Jamwal Rajput Dogra Dynasty. Like all other princely states in India then, Kashmir too enjoyed only partial autonomy, as the real control was with the British.\n\nAlso read: Special Category Status\n\nThe ruler\u2019s stand (at the time of Partition)\n\nDuring the time of partition of British India (1947), Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) was a Princely State. Britishers had given all princely states a choice \u2013 either to join India to join Pakistan or even to remain independent.\n\nThe ruler of Kashmir during that time (1947) was Maharaja Hari Singh, the great-grandson of Maharaja Gulab Singh. He was a Hindu who ruled over a majority-Muslim princely state.\n\nHe did not want to merge with India or Pakistan.\n\nHari Singh tried to negotiate with India and Pakistan to have an independent status for his state. He offered a proposal of a Standstill Agreement to both the Dominion, pending a final decision on the State\u2019s accession. On August 12, 1947, the Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir sent identical communications to the Governments of India and Pakistan.\n\nPakistan accepted the offer and sent a communication to J&K Prime Minister on August 15, 1947. It read, \u201cThe Government of Pakistan agrees to have Standstill Agreement with Jammu and Kashmir for the continuation of existing arrangements \u2026\u201d\n\nIndia advised the Maharaja to send his authorized representative to Delhi for further discussion on the offer.\n\nWhat were the Kashmiri people\u2019s aspirations in 1947?\n\nKashmiri people took part extensively in the Indian Nationalist Movement. They not only wanted to get rid of British rule but also never wanted to be under the rule of the Dogra dynasty once the nationalist movement achieved its mission. The Kashmiris had preferred democracy to monarchy.\n\nJammu and Kashmir was always a secular state \u2013 with a history of Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh rule. Even though the majority population was Muslims, it then had a significant Hindu population as well.\n\nIndia in 1947 had suggested conducting a plebiscite to know the aspirations of Kashmiri people. With tall leaders of Jammu and Kashmir like Sheik Abdullah on its side, cherishing the common values \u2013 secularism, democracy, and pan-India nationalism \u2013 India was confident to win the Plebiscite if it was held in 1947.\n\nIndia\u2019s stand with Junagadh, another princely state, was also to conduct a plebiscite. In 1947, upon the\u00a0independence\u00a0and\u00a0partition of India, the last Muslim ruler of the Junagadh state,\u00a0Muhammad Mahabat Khanji III, decided to merge Junagadh into the newly formed\u00a0Pakistan. The majority of the population were Hindus. The conflict led to many revolts and also a\u00a0plebiscite, resulting in the\u00a0integration of Junagadh into India.\n\nHowever, the Pakistan attack on Kashmir in October 1947 changed all dynamics. The exact aspirations of Kashmiri People at that time is still unknown \u2013 as a plebiscite or referendum was never held.\n\nThe Pakistan Invasion of Kashmir in 1947\n\nPakistan, though entered into a Standstill Agreement with Jammu and Kashmir, had an eye on it. It broke the Standstill Agreement by sponsoring a tribal militant attack in Kashmir in October 1947.\n\nPashtun raiders from Pakistan invaded Kashmir in October 1947 and took control over a large area. Hari Singh appealed to the Governor General of free India, Lord Mountbatten for assistance.\n\nIndia assured help on the condition Hari Singh should sign the Instrument of Accession. Maharaja Hari Singh signed the instrument of accession with India (1947). It was also agreed that once the situation normalized, the views of the people of J&K will be ascertained about their future.\n\nJammu and Kashmir signs the Instrument of Accession with India\nJammu and Kashmir signs the Instrument of Accession with India\n\nThe Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession to India on 26 October 1947 in Srinagar.\n\nAs soon as the accession documents were signed, the Indian Armed Force took over the stage to repulse Pakistan-supported tribal assault.\n\nIndian and Pakistani forces thus fought their first war over Kashmir in 1947-48.\n\nIndia successfully drove out most of the Pak-supported tribal militants from Kashmir occupation. However, one part of the State came under Pakistani control. India claims that this area is under illegal occupation. Pakistan describes this area as \u2018Azad Kashmir\u2019. India however, does not recognize this term. India uses the term Pak-occupied Kashmir (PoK) for the area of Kashmir under the control of Pakistan.\n\nIndia brings the United Nations (UN) into the picture\n\nIndia referred the dispute to the United Nations Security Council on 1 January 1948. Following the set-up of the\u00a0United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan\u00a0(UNCIP), the UN Security Council passed\u00a0Resolution 47\u00a0on 21 April 1948.\n\nThe UN Resolution was non-binding on India and Pakistan. However, this is what the UN resolution mentioned:\n\nUN Resolution on Jammu and Kashmir\n\nThe UN resolutions clearly said :\n\nPakistan is the aggressor in the state.\nPakistan has to vacate all occupied territory in the state and hand over the vacated territory to India.\nIndia has to remove all its forces leaving aside enough to maintain law and order.\nIndia to conduct a plebiscite in the state.\nWhy has no Plebiscite or Referendum been held in Kashmir yet?\nThe state of Jammu and Kashmir is defined as it existed on or before the invasion of Pakistan on 22nd October 1947. This includes the present territory of Pak-occupied Kashmir (POK), Gilgit, Baltistan, Jammu, Laddhak, and Kashmir Valley.\nPakistan asked for time to vacate its occupation but it never complied.\nAs nearly one-third of the state of Jammu and Kashmir is still under the occupation of Pakistan, it is a non-compliance of conditions leading to the plebiscite.\nSheikh Abdullah\u2019s movement \u2013 Formal incorporation of Kashmir into the Indian Union\n\nKashmir\u2019s first political party, the Muslim Conference, was formed in 1925, with Sheikh Abdullah as president. Later, in 1938, it was renamed as National Conference. The National Conference was a secular organization and had a long association with Congress. Sheikh Abdullah was a personal friend of some of the leading nationalist leaders including Nehru.\n\nNational Conference started a popular movement to get rid of the Maharaja. Sheikh Abdullah was the leader.\n\nAfter Maharaja Hari Singh signed an \u2018Instrument of Accession\u2019 with the Government of India, Sheikh Abdullah took over as the Prime Minister of the State of J&K (the head of the government in the State was then called Prime Minister) in March 1948.\n\nSheikh Abdullah was against Jammu and Kashmir joining Pakistan. However, he took a pro-referendum stance and delayed the formal accession to India. The pro-Indian authorities dismissed the state government and arrested Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah.\n\nThe new Jammu and Kashmir government ratified the accession to India. In 1957, Kashmir was formally incorporated into the Indian Union.\n\nKashmir Issue \u2013 External Disputes\nKashmir Issue \u2013 Jammu and Kashmir Map\n\nExternally, ever since 1947, Kashmir remained a major issue of\u00a0conflict between India and Pakistan (and between India and China to a minor extent).\n\nPakistan has always claimed that the Kashmir valley should be part of Pakistan. The conflict resulted in 3 main wars between India and Pakistan \u2013 1947, 1965, and 1971. A war-like situation erupted in 1998 as well (Kargil war).\n\nPakistan was not only the illegal occupant of the Kashmir region. China too started claiming parts of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nBy the 1950s, China started to gradually occupy the eastern Kashmir (Aksai Chin). In\u00a01962, India fought a war with\u00a0China over its encroachments, however, China defeated India. To make matters worse,\u00a0Pakistan ceded the Trans-Karakoram Tract of Kashmir (Saksham Valley) to China.\n\nKashmir Issue \u2013 Internal Disputes\n\nInternally, there is a dispute about the status of Kashmir within the Indian Union.\n\nKashmir was given autonomy and a special status by Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. Articles like 370, 371, 35A, etc are connected with privileges given to Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nWhat is the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir?\n\nArticle 370 gives greater autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir compared to the other States of India.\nThe State has its own Constitution.\nAll provisions of the Indian Constitution do not apply to the State.\nLaws passed by the Parliament apply to J&K only if the State agrees.\nNon-Kashmiri Indians cannot buy property in Kashmir.\n\nThis special status has provoked two opposite reactions.\n\nA section feels that Article 370 is not needed!\n\nThere is a section of people outside of J&K that believes that the special status of the State conferred by Article 370 does not allow full integration of the State with India. This section feels that Article 370 should, therefore, be revoked and J&K should be like any other State in India.\n\nAnother section feels that Article 370 is not enough!\n\nAnother section, mostly Kashmiris, believes that the autonomy conferred by Article 370 is not enough.\n\nMajor Grievances of Kashmiris:\n\nKashmiris have expressed at least three major grievances.\n\nFirst, the promise that Accession would be referred to the people of the State after the situation created by tribal invasion was normalized, has not been fulfilled. They demand a \u2018Plebiscite\u2019 at the earliest.\nSecondly, there is a feeling that the special federal status guaranteed by Article 370, has been eroded in practice. This has led to the demand for restoration of autonomy or \u2018Greater State Autonomy\u2019.\nThirdly, it is felt that democracy which is practised in the rest of India has not been similarly institutionalised in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\nPolitics since 1948 \u2013 Conflict between the Kashmir State Government and the Central Government of India\n\nAfter taking over as the Prime Minister, Sheikh Abdullah initiated major land reforms and other policies that benefited ordinary people. But there was a growing difference between him and the central government about his position on Kashmir\u2019s status. He was dismissed in 1953 and kept in detention for several years.\n\nThe leadership that succeeded him did not enjoy as much popular support and was able to rule the State mainly due to the support of\nthe Centre. There were serious allegations of malpractices and rigging in various elections.\n\nDuring most of the period between 1953 and 1974, the Congress party exercised a lot of influence on the politics of the State. A truncated National Conference (minus Sheikh Abdullah) remained in power with the active support of Congress for some time but later it merged with the Congress.\n\nThus Congress gained direct control over the government in the State.\n\nIn the meanwhile, there were several attempts to reach an agreement between Sheikh Abdullah and the Government of India.\n\nFinally, in 1974 Indira Gandhi reached an agreement with Sheikh Abdullah and he became the Chief Minister of the State.\n\nThe Revival of National Conference (1977)\n\nHe revived the National Conference which was elected with a majority in the assembly elections held in 1977.\n\nSheikh Abdullah died in 1982 and the leadership of the National Conference went to his son, Farooq Abdullah, who became the Chief Minister.\n\nBut he was soon dismissed by the Governor and a breakaway faction of the National Conference came to power for a brief period.\n\nThe dismissal of Farooq Abdullah\u2019s government due to the intervention of the Centre generated a\u00a0feeling of resentment in Kashmir. The confidence that Kashmiris had developed in the democratic processes after the accord between Indira Gandhi and Sheikh Abdullah, received a setback.\n\nThe feeling that the Centre was intervening in the politics of the State was further strengthened when the National Conference in 1986 agreed to have an electoral alliance with the Congress, the ruling party in the Centre.\n\n1987 Assembly Elections, Political Crisis, and Insurgency\n\nIt was in this environment that the 1987 Assembly election took place. The official results showed a massive victory for the National Conference-Congress alliance and Farooq Abdullah returned as Chief Minister.\n\nHowever, it was widely believed that the results did not reflect the popular choice and that the entire election process was rigged.\n\nA popular resentment had already been brewing in the State against the inefficient administration since the early 1980s. This was now augmented by the commonly prevailing feeling that democratic processes were being undermined at the behest of the Centre. This generated a political crisis in Kashmir which became severe with the rise of the insurgency.\n\nBy 1989, the State had come into the grip of a militant movement mobilized around the cause of a separate Kashmiri nation.\n\nThe insurgents got moral, material, and military support from Pakistan. The balance of influence had decisively tilted in Pakistan\u2019s favor by the late 1980s, with people\u2019s sympathy no longer with the Indian Union as it had been in 1947-48, 1965 or 1971.\n\nThe terrorists and militants drove out almost all the Hindus from the Kashmir valley, ensuring that a future plebiscite (if it happens) would be meaningless.\n\nIndia imposed the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) in Jammu and Kashmir in 1990.\n\nFor several years, the State was under President\u2019s rule and effectively under the control of the armed forces. Throughout the period from 1990, Jammu and Kashmir experienced violence at the hands of the insurgents and through army action.\n\n1990 and Beyond \u2013 Growing Trust Deficit\n\nAfter 1987, the pro-India sentiments of Kashmiri people tilted heavily towards Kashmiri Separatism. Pakistan, of course, added fuel to the fire \u2013 by giving moral and financial support to terrorists, militants, and insurgents. As a result, Kashmir frequently witnessed violence, curfew, stone-pelting, and firing between the troops of India and Pakistan across the Line of Control (LoC).\n\nThousands of soldiers, civilians, and militants have been killed in the uprising and the Indian crackdown since 1989.\n\nEven though state elections were conducted, Kashmir did not return to normalcy before 1987.\n\nAssembly elections in the State were held only in 1996 in which the National Conference led by Farooq Abdullah came to power with a demand for regional autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nJ&K experienced a very fair election in 2002. The National Conference failed to win a majority and was replaced by the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and Congress coalition government.\n\nIn 2015, India\u2019s ruling BJP party was sworn into government in Indian-administered Kashmir for the first time in coalition with the local People\u2019s Democratic Party, with the latter\u2019s Mufti Mohammad Sayeed as chief minister (followed by Mehbooba Mufti because of the death of her father and party founder). However, this coalition didn\u2019t last for long.\n\nEven though the Government of India is taking many steps to stop the insurgency and bring Kashmir back to normalcy, terrorist attacks like that in Pulwama have seriously hindered the peace process.\n\nThe Current Stand of India \u2013 Regarding the Kashmir Question\nNo more mediation with the UN or any other other third parties.\nIndia and Pakistan should resolve issues through bilateral talks as agreed by the Simla Agreement.\nNo Plebiscite in Kashmir unless Pakistan reverses the situation back to what was in 1947 (territory and demographics).\nWho are the Kashmir\u00a0Separatists?\nAll Parties Hurriyat Conference\nJammu Kashmir Liberation Front\nHarkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami\nLashkar-e-Taiba\nJaish-e-Mohammed\nHizbul Mujahideen\nHarkat-ul-Mujahideen\nAl-Badr\nAnsar Ghazwat-ul-Hind Flag.png Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (Since 2017)\nWhat do Separatists demand?\n\nSeparatist politics which surfaced in Kashmir from 1989 has taken different forms and is made up of various strands.\n\nThere is one strand\u00a0of separatists who want a separate Kashmiri nation, independent of India and Pakistan.\nThen some groups want Kashmir to merge with Pakistan.\nBesides these, there is a third strand which wants greater autonomy for the people of the state within the Indian union.\nDemand for intra-state autonomy\n\nEven though the name of the state is Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), it comprises three social and political regions: Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh.\n\nJammu \u2013 The Jammu region is a mix of foothills and plains, of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs and speakers of various languages.\nKashmir \u2013 Kashmir Valley is the heart of the Kashmir region. The people are Kashmiri-speaking and are mostly Muslims. There is also a small Kashmiri-speaking Hindu minority.\nLadakh \u2013 The Ladakh region is mountainous, and has a very small population which is equally divided between Buddhists and Muslims. Ladakh is divided into two main regions \u2013 Leh and Kargil.\n\nIt should also be noted that out of the 3 main administrative divisions \u2013 Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh \u2013 insurgency and demand for independence is high only in the Kashmir Valley. Most of the people in Jammu and Ladakh still wish to be part of India, even though they demand autonomy differently. They often complain of neglect and backwardness. The demand for intra-state autonomy is as strong as the demand for State autonomy in the regions of Jammu and Ladakh.\n\nArticle 370: Changes made via Presidential order of 2019\n\nOn 5 August 2019, Home Minister\u00a0Amit Shah\u00a0announced in the\u00a0Rajya Sabha\u00a0(upper house of the Indian Parliament) that the President of India had issued\u00a0The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 (C.O. 272) under Article 370, superseding the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.\n\nThe order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nWhile the 1954 order specified that only some articles of the Indian constitution to apply to the state, the new order removed all such restrictions.\n\nThis in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated.\n\nThe President issued the order with the \u201cconcurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir\u201d, which meant the Governor appointed by the Union government.\n\nChange of status: Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019\nThe latest map of Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh\n\nAfter the Government of India repealed the special status accorded to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Indian constitution in 2019, the Parliament of India passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, which contained provisions that dissolved the state and reorganized it into two union territories \u2013 Jammu and Kashmir in the west and Ladakh in the east.\n\nThe two union territories came into existence on 31 October 2019, which was celebrated as National Unity Day.\n\nThe union territory of Jammu and Kashmir was proposed to have a legislature under the bill whereas the union territory of Ladakh is proposed to not have one.\n\nUrge for Peace\n\nThe initial period of popular support for militancy has now given way to the urge for peace.\n\nThe Centre has started negotiations with various separatist groups. Instead of demanding a separate nation, most of the separatists in the dialogue are trying to re-negotiate a relationship of the State with India.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Kashmir issue \u2013 has multiple dimensions \u2013 external and internal; inter-state as well as intra-state. Not even the separatists are on the same ground \u2013 their demands are different.\n\nThe princely state of Jammu and Kashmir which was under the control of British India \u2013 is now not entirely with India. Pakistan and China too now occupy a significant portion of the territories of the erstwhile princely state.\n\nOf course, the Kashmir problem also includes the issue of Kashmiri identity known as Kashmiriyat. However, almost every state in India has its own identity \u2013 Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, West Bengal, or Kerala. However, the people in each of these states even when seeing themselves as Tamilians, Kannadagans, Bengalis or Malayalis are also able to see the bigger picture \u2013 they identify themselves as Indians.\n\nJammu and Kashmir is one of the living examples of plural society and politics. Not only are there diversities of all kinds (religious, cultural, linguistic, ethnic, tribal) but there are also divergent political aspirations.\n\nUnfortunately, from the perspective of the youth of Kashmir, there is a growing trust deficit. It\u2019s a hard reality that Jammu and Kashmir never functioned like other Indian states since its accession to India. It had given higher autonomy initially, however, it got eroded in practice.\n\nThe first step to solving the Kashmir issue is to identify the problems behind the alienation of Kashmir. Here are some of them:\n\nMishandling of the Kashmir Issue by the successive Central governments of India \u2013 which includes frequent dismissal of State Assemblies.\nThe state governments of Kashmir failed to distribute the benefits of growth and development to every area of Kashmir.\nThe terrorist and military outfits in Pakistan have been distancing the youth of Kashmir from the democratic form of the Indian government.\nThe regular presence of the Indian Armed Force or CAPF in the Kashmir interiors, and the misuse of provisions like ASFPA.\n\nTo find a solution to the Kashmir issue \u2013 all stakeholders should be considered.\n\nWhat is the need of the hour is proper integration of Kashmir, Jammu, and Ladakh with India. Integration should not be seen in a limited dimension of territory. India should be able to win the hearts of the people of Kashmir.\n\nOnly time can tell about the success of the changes made concerning the provisions of Article 370.\n\nKashmir was and still is an integral part of India. It has a plural and secular culture \u2013 just like the rest of India. Urgent steps should be taken to bridge the gaps of trust deficit in the minds of Kashmiri youth. All Kashmiris should get the due share in the growth story of India. Like all other states in India, there should be adequate political autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nViolence, terrorism, and killings are never the answer \u2013 be it on any side.

Hundreds of millions of civilians were also dragged into the conflict \u2013 as factory workers, as suppliers of food or entertainment, as prisoners, as slave labourers, and as targets. Every corner of the planet, even those far from the fighting, was affected by this global catastrophe. The end of the war is often remembered as an idealistic time, often referred to as the zero-year marking the beginning of new world order.\n\nAmerica emerged in 1945 as the undisputed victor of the war. It had the largest navy, the largest air force, and an army that was rivalled only by that of the Soviets.\n\nHence two great powers forming two super-power blocs US and the Soviet Union emerge with an undeclared Cold War between them. Their ideologies, communism and capitalism emerge as strong ideologies, fighting each other while expanding.\n\nCondition of other participants of the war\n\nThe main parties in the war had to pay their price after the Second world war came to a halt.\n\nGermany\n\nGermany started with the process of denazification. It was an Allied initiative to rid German and Austrian society, culture, press, economy, judiciary, and politics of the National Socialist ideology (Nazism), solidified by Potsdam Agreement.\n\nJapan\n\nAt the same time in Japan, the Zaibatsu system was being demolished. Zaibatsu is a Japanese term referring to industrial and financial vertically integrated business conglomerates in the Empire of Japan, whose influence and size allowed control over significant parts of the Japanese economy from the Meiji period until the end of World War II.\n\nAfter World War II they were dissolved by the Allied occupation forces and succeeded by the Keiretsu (groups of banks, manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors). However, complete dissolution of the zaibatsu was never achieved, mostly because the U.S. government rescinded the orders to reindustrialize Japan as a bulwark against communism in Asia. But their old influence and power had been destroyed.\n\nCondition in South America\n\nIn Latin America as elsewhere, the close of World War II was accompanied by expectations, only partly fulfilled, of steady economic development and democratic consolidation. Military dictatorships and Marxist revolution were among the solutions put forward, but none were truly successful. Military dictatorships fell like ninepins in Ecuador, Venezuela, Guatemala and Bolivia. Peru held its first-ever free elections in 1945.\n\nEffect of World War on advancement in the field of Science and Technology\n\nEven in the field of science and technology world war had a great impact. In fact, no war had as profound an effect on the technologies of our current lives than World War II (1939-45). And no war was as profoundly affected by science, math, and technology than WWII. We can point to numerous new inventions and scientific principles that emerged during the war. These include-\n\nAdvances in rocketry, pioneered by Nazi Germany. They developed the so-called \u201cV-weapons\u201d which were a particular set of long-range artillery weapons designed for strategic bombing during World War II. It included the V-1 or buzz bomb which was an automatic aircraft (today known as a \u201ccruise missile\u201d) and the V-2 which was a ballistic missile that flew into space before falling down on its target\nElectronic computers were developed by the British for breaking the Nazi \u201cEnigma\u201d codes, and by the Americans for calculating ballistics and other battlefield equations.\nThe entire technology of radar, which is the ability to use radio waves to detect objects at a distance, was barely invented at the start of the war but became highly developed in just a few years. It was this technology that later helped in the development of modern electronics especially television.\nWorld War II also saw advances in medical technology. Penicillin was not invented during the war, but it was the first mass-produced during the war. Pesticides like DDT came into being to protect the soldiers from mosquitoes.\n\nIn India, efforts had begun even before the independence to invest in science and technological advancements. Our leaders like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawahar Lal Nehru etc. greatly emphasised on scientific temper and its development in society. Here, under the guidance of Dr. Homi Bhabha, a strong pursuit for nuclear researches and advancements were on since 1941. In 1948 the Atomic Energy Commission of India was formed with Dr. Bhabha as the chairman.\n\nTime of struggle for independence in many countries\n\nIn Asia, many countries were working on their independence during World War II. For instance, the future prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, frequently invoked the Second World War as one of the major factors in his country\u2019s rebirth as an independent nation.\n\nIndonesian struggle against Dutch (1945-50)\n\nThe Indonesian National Revolution or Indonesian War of Independence took place between Indonesia\u2019s declaration of independence in 1945 and the Netherlands\u2019 recognition of Indonesia\u2019s independence at the end of 1949. Indonesia\u2019s future president, Sukarno, went so far as to thank god for the recent years of violence, which had given birth to a \u201cfree Indonesia tempered in the fire of war\u201d. For these countries and many more across Asia and Africa, 1945 was presented as the dawn of a new age.\n\nVietnam war against France (1945-54)\n\nAlso known as the First Indochina War (generally known as the Indochina War in France, and as the Anti-French Resistance War in Vietnam) began in French Indochina on December 19, 1946, and lasted until July 20, 1954. In 1954, the Geneva Conference was held to settle outstanding issues resulting from the Korean and Indochina War.\n\nFreedom of Ceylon and Burma (1948)\n\nThe Burmese Declaration of Independence was officially promulgated on 4 January 1948, marking the end of British rule in Burma (now Myanmar).\n\nThe Sri Lankan independence movement was a peaceful political movement which was aimed at achieving independence and self-rule for the country of Sri Lanka, then British Ceylon, from the British Empire. The switch of powers was generally known as a peaceful transfer of power from the British administration to Ceylon representatives. Ceylon was granted independence as the Dominion of Ceylon on 4 February 1948.\n\nIndia\n\nIn India, the freedom struggle was on. In 1946, the cabinet mission plan was sent. An interim government was formed. First session of the constituent assembly was held on 9th Dec 1946. The Mountbatten Plan of India\u2019s partition is announced and the Indian Independence Act is passed in 1947.\n\nPost-independent India\n\nSo, when the entire world was undergoing a massive change. Let us deeply delve into the events that were shaping our nation formation. Let us see what all incidents were happening in India simultaneously during this period. Let us begin with the political situation.\n\nThe political situation in India\n\nAfter independence, our country faced major challenges like:\n\nThe division of assets\nThe Refugee Problem\nOrigin of the Kashmir Problem\nFoundation of the Indian Democracy\nLinguistic Reorganization\n\nThe country had to sort it out one by one. The foremost challenge of integration of princely states was taken up by Sardar Vallabhai Patel who along with V. P. Menon convinced the rulers of princely states contiguous to India to accede to India. British India then consisted of 17 provinces and 562 princely states.\n\nThere were three states that proved more difficult to integrate than others which were-\n\nJunagadh (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim Nawab) \u2013 With the independence of India in 1947, the princely states were left by the British to decide whether to accede to one of the newly independent states of India or Pakistan or to remain outside them. The then Nawab of Junagarh had announced that Junagarh would accede to Pakistan. The majority of the people of Junagarh revolted, leading to the near-collapse of the state government, and India had to send its military into Junagarh. In December 1947 plebiscite was conducted in Junagarh where 91% of the population of Junagarh voted to merge with India, annulling the controversial accession to Pakistan.\nHyderabad (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim nizam)\u2013 by 1948 when almost all states had acceded to either India or Pakistan, there was an exception of the principality of Hyderabad. The Nizam of Hyderabad chose independence and hoped to maintain this with an irregular army recruited from the Muslim aristocracy, known as the Razakars. With the rise of militant razakars, India found it necessary to station Indian troops and invaded the state (under an operation codenamed Operation Polo) in September 1948 to compel the Nizam. Subsequently, the Nizam signed an instrument of accession. It was incorporated as a state of India the next year.\nThe area of Kashmir (Muslim-majority state with a Hindu king) in the far north of the subcontinent quickly became a source of controversy that erupted into the First Indo-Pakistani War which lasted from 1947 to 1949. Eventually, a United Nations-overseen ceasefire was agreed that left India in control of two-thirds of the contested region. Jawaharlal Nehru initially agreed to Mountbatten\u2019s proposal that a plebiscite be held in the entire state as soon as hostilities ceased, and an UN-sponsored cease-fire was agreed to by both parties on 1 Jan. 1949. No statewide plebiscite was held, however, for in 1954, after Pakistan began to receive arms from the United States, Nehru withdrew his support. The Indian Constitution came into force in Kashmir on 26 January 1950 with special clauses for the state i.e. the article 370.\nDemand for linguistic reorganisation\n\nThe demand for states on a linguistic basis had started even before independence. This attained more strength after the initial political integration of provinces and princely states. However, the government got concerned that the state solely formed on a linguistic basis might be unsuitable and might pose some potential risk to the unity of the nation.\n\nOn June 17 1948, Dr Rajendra Prasad set up a linguistic provinces commission including SK Dhar, popularly known as the Dhar commission.\n\nThey recommended the reorganization on the basis of:\n\nGeographical continuity\nFinancial self-sufficiency\nAdministrative convenience\nAnd the capacity for future development\n\nHowever, resentment continued and the Dhar commission was followed up by JVP committee. Amidst all this, the first constitutional amendment is passed in 1951. It provided against abuse of freedom of speech and expression, validation of zamindari abolition laws, and clarified that the right to equality does not bar the enactment of laws which provide \u201cspecial consideration\u201d for weaker sections of society. It amended Article 19 for the purposes indicated above and to insert provisions fully securing the constitutional validity of zamindari abolition laws in general. Article 31A and 31B was introduced to validate enactments related to Zamindari Abolition. It brought in schedule 9 of the constitution to protect the land reform and other laws present in it from the judicial review.\n\nAnother major happening in this line is that in 1952 India conducts its first general election.\n\nThe economic situation of post-independent India\n\nBefore moving into further political advancements let\u2019s see what were the economic scenario in India during these initial years. While our country was busy integrating states and going on war with Pakistan, parallel efforts of boosting the Indian economy, expanding the welfare, income and industrial development were being worked upon, as discussed below-\n\n1947: \u00a0\u00a0 India\u2019s first finance minister, R.K. Shanmukham Chetty tabled the country\u2019s first Union budget in Parliament.\n1948:\nThe Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 proposing a mixed economy- It envisaged a substantial public sector with state interventions and regulations in order to protect indigenous industries\nMinimum wages Act of 1948 -1. It declared that governments (both central and states) not economic agents would decide the amount of wages paid, even before industrialisation started in India.It aimed to set the minimum wages that must be paid to skilled and unskilled labours.\nFactories Act 1948- Laws on factories have been there since 1881. The Factories Act was comprehensively enacted on 23 September 1948 to protect workers in factories, by consolidating and amending the law that regulated condition of labour in factories (occupational safety and health).\nDevelopment finance institutions Act, 1948 \u2013 The first financial institution and development bank to be created after Independence, Industrial Finance Corporation of India (now IFCI Ltd), was formed on 27 March 1948\n\nThe Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 defined the broad contours of the policy delineating the role of the State in industrial development both as an entrepreneur and authority. It made clear that India is going to have a Mixed Economic Model. The emphasis on mixed economy resulted in greater involvement of the state in different segments of the economy.\n\nThe Industries (Development and Regula\u00adtion) Act was passed in 1951 to implement the Industrial Policy Resolution, 1948.\n\nNationalising RBI:\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India, India\u2019s central banking authority, was established in April 1935\u00a0but was nationalized on 1 January 1949 under the terms of the Reserve Bank of India (Transfer to Public Ownership) Act, 1948 (RBI, 2005b). In 1949, the Banking Regulation Act was enacted, which empowered the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to regulate, control, and inspect the banks in India. The Banking Regulation Act also provided that no new bank or branch of an existing bank could be opened without a license from the RBI, and no two banks could have common directors.\n\nFormation of Planning Commission:\n\nThis was followed up by setting up of a Planning Commission (the successor of planning committee formed by Subhash Chandra Bose under Jawahar Lal Nehru as the head). After India achieved independence, a formal model of planning was adopted, and accordingly, the Planning Commission, reporting directly to the Prime Minister of India, was established on 15 March 1950, with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as the Chairman. The first five-year plan comes into force.\n\nPassing Indian Industries Act, 1951-\n\nTo implement the industrial policy of 1948. The period is marked with the beginning of license raj.\n\nEstablishing ISI (Indian Standards Institution) in 1952-\n\nThe ISI was established in the year 1947. It has been renamed as the \u2018Bureau of Indian Standards \u2018. Its main objective is to lay down quality standards for consumer and industrial goods. Symbolic of the role, the Indian Standards Institution (I.S.I.) was to play the first standard drawn for independent India. It was legalised in 1952 by an act of parliament.\n\nNationalising Air India, 1953-\n\nIn 1952, the condition of all the airlines witnessed a general deterioration all over the world. To rescue the airline sector of the country, Planning Commission of India recommended the merger of all the scheduled airlines into a single integrated corporation. Parliament voted to nationalise nine airlines. The function of the corporations was to provide safe, efficient, adequate, economical and properly coordinated air 92 transport services, whether internal or international or both.\n\nIn 1953, the Government of India passed the Air Corporations Act and purchased a majority stake. However, this act of government is often criticised as leading to the under-development of the aviation sector in India instead.\n\nNationalising Imperial Bank in 1955-\n\nFurthering the nationalisation process anther major event was the nationalisation of Imperial Bank, forming State Bank of India. The Imperial Bank of India came into existence on 27 January 1921 through the reorganisation and amalgamation of the three Presidency Banks of colonial India into a single banking entity. The Imperial Bank of India performed all the normal functions which a commercial bank was expected to perform. In the absence of any central banking institution in India until 1935, the Imperial Bank of India also performed a number of functions which are normally carried out by a central bank. After RBI came into force it acquired a controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India in 1955, which was renamed on 30 April 1955 to the State Bank of India and later legalised.\n\nSo, we know that many efforts were ongoing with the aim of transforming the Indian economy. Meanwhile, let us not forgot that our issue of linguistic reorganisation had not yet been finished. In 1953, in an effort to protect the interests of the Telugu people of Madras State, Potti Sreeramulu attempted to force the Madras state government to listen to public demands for the separation of Telugu-speaking districts (Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra) from Madras State to form Andhra State. He went on a lengthy fast and only stopped when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru promised to form Andhra State. While in 1954 Kashmir\u2019s constituent assembly ratifies its accession to India.\n\nContinuing with the institutional developments-\n\nSetting up of Oil and Gas division-\n\nAfter independence, the Central Government of India realized the importance of oil and gas for rapid industrial development and its strategic role in defence. Consequently, while framing the Industrial Policy Statement of 1948, the development of the petroleum industry in the country was considered to be of utmost necessity. Until 1955, private oil companies mainly carried out exploration of hydrocarbon resources of India. Later an Oil and Natural Gas Division was set up in October 1955 under the Geological Survey of India to explore and develop hydrocarbon resources of India. The same year, the division was converted into an Oil and Natural Gas Directorate then into a commission and finally, after three years, it was converted into a statutory body.\n\nEssential commodities Act 1955-\n\nIt was passed to regulate the production, supply and distribution of \u2018essential\u2019 commodities such as drugs, oils, kerosene, coal, iron, steel and pulses, considering the situation of the Indian economy that was ravaged by famine and food shortages.\n\nAfter all these necessary reforms time was up for the second five-year plan that was mandated in 1956. Related to it, the second industrial policy resolution was passed in 1956.\nNationalisation of LIC\n\nIt was conducted with an objective to prevent unfair trade practices. The act followed the Second Five Year Plan and the industrial policy resolution of 1956, both of which codified the Licence Raj and looked at all private enterprises with suspicion.\n\nSwitching to the world view\nTibetan uprising (1959):\n\nIt was an uprising against the presence of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Tibet. Well, the story goes like this that Buddhist Tibet, a vast Himalayan area of plateaus and mountains, declared independence from China in the early 20th century but Beijing took back control in 1951, having sent in thousands of troops. The Dalai Lama, chosen at the age of two in 1937 as the 14th incarnation of Tibetan Buddhism\u2019s supreme religious leader, was enthroned as the head of state after the Chinese invasion.\n\nHis co-existence with the Beijing authorities was tense and when the Chinese authorities summoned him to an event without his bodyguards on March 10, Tibetans feared a trap that could endanger their leader. To this Beijing responds by sending more troops. The failure of the armed rebellion ultimately resulted in a violent crackdown on Tibetan independence movements, and the flight of the Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso into exile. The Dalai Lama evaded Chinese authorities and slipped away dressed as a soldier, escaping to India with an entourage of supporters in a gruelling two-week trek through the Himalaya. This incident has an implication on the future Indo-China War of 1962.\n\nListening to the Tibetan story let me remind you there were other major happenings, that we need to remember, which were shaping the course of the current world. One among this was the formation of Israel.\n\nIsrael-Palestine\n\nIn 1947, the British Government referred to the question of the future of Palestine to the United Nations, following the huge influx of Jews to Palestine after the second world war. UN voted to split the land into two countries. Jewish people accepted the agreement and declared the independence of Israel. This was not liked by the Arab nations and they declared war against Israel. However, Israel emerges victorious in the war. In 1950 Israel passes the \u201claw of return\u201d, granting automatic citizenship to any immigrant Jew.\n\nKorean War:\n\nAnother important event happening around the same time was the Korean war that started in 1950. This happened when during the beginning of the cold war, the Soviet dispensation backed a communist regime in Korean peninsula\u2019s Northern region. And at the same time, US faction was backing a liberal government that eventually took control of the southern part of the peninsula.\n\nThe inter-Korean war lasted for three years between 1950 and 1953, which was a proxy war between USSR and the US. India under Nehru was actively involved in negotiating peace in the Korean peninsula by engaging all the major stakeholders \u2013 the US, USSR and China. In late 1952, the Indian resolution on Korea was adopted at the UN with unanimous non-Soviet support.\n\nThe situation in Taiwan\n\nThe next incident was the take-over of Taiwan by kai-shek. After the end of World War II, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang), led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong. Through-out the months in 1949, the Chinese communist party gains control in the Chinese mainland leading to defeat of the nationalist army. The nationalist party then evacuates its office and shifts it to Taiwan then known as Formosa, forming the Republic of China. This is followed by a series of events. Eventually, the ROC loses its UN seat which is given to Peoples republic of china.\n\nWorld economic updates\nThe\u00a0post\u2013World War II economic expansion, also known as the\u00a0golden age of capitalism.\nIn 1945 the lending arm of World Bank, IBRD is established. The IBRD provides commercial-grade or concessional financing to sovereign states to fund projects that seek to improve transportation and infrastructure, education, domestic policy, environmental consciousness, energy investments, healthcare, access to food and potable water, and access to improved sanitation.\nIn 1956 the second member of world bank group IFC is established as the private-sector arm of the World Bank Group, to advance\u00a0economic development\u00a0by investing in for-profit and commercial projects for poverty reduction and promoting development.\nImportant Environmental Updates\nIn 1948 the World Conservation Union\u00a0or International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) is established. It is an international organization dedicated to natural resource conservation.\nIn 1954 the first\u00a0nuclear power plant\u00a0to generate electricity for a\u00a0power grid\u00a0started operations at\u00a0Obninsk,\u00a0Soviet Union.\nIn 1956 starts surfacing the Minamata disease, a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning.\nTo be continued\u2026\n\nThe timeline study of the current video ends here.\n\nThis is to be continued with another period of timeline studies via crossroads at CearIAS.\n\nSubscribe to ClearIAS YouTube Channel, and click on the \u2018bell icon\u2019 to receive notifications about the new updates.\n\nLecture by: Honey Mathew"

Congress was ruling as the major voice of diverse India and till the second general elections, no major party was seen to emerge as a major opposition to Congress until the formation of Swantatra Party in 1959.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt can be considered as the first major liberal party of independent India that rose to prominence. It was formed on 4 June 1959, shortly after the Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress, C. Rajagopalachari, along with Murari Vaidya and Minoo Masani, a classical liberal and critic of socialist Nehru.\n\nTill the rise of Swatantra Party, right-wing groups and parties had existed earlier at the local and regional levels only. Swatantra\u2019s formation, however, was the first attempt to bring these highly fragmented right-wing forces together under the umbrella of a single party. The provocation for the formation of such a party was the left turn which the Congress took at Avadi (the Congress party itself adopted a resolution to establish a \u2018socialistic pattern of society\u2019 in its Avadi session as early as in 1955 and took measures accordingly.) and Nagpur sessions.\n\nAs Swatantra stood for a market-based economy with the \u201cLicence Raj\u201d dismantled, they formed a major voice against the socialist functioning of the then government. It was founded on the conviction that social justice and welfare can be attained through the fostering of individual interest and individual enterprise in all fields better than through State ownership and Government control.\n\nBy the next general election in 1967, Swatantra had become a significant force in some parts of India; it won 8.7%of votes and became the single largest opposition party in the 4th Lok Sabha (1967-1971) helping to balance the parliamentary democracy.\n\nTransfer and annexation of land between India and other foreign countries\n\nThe transfer of lands after the partition and inclusion of many foreign territories into India had not yet been done with. In 1960 we face an issue regarding the cessation of Beru-bari union.\n\nBeru-Bari Union Case\n\nWe know that India and Pakistan boundary was fixed by Sir Radcliffe and the line was called Radcliffe Line. However, some disputes arose because of the erroneous depiction of the maps by the Radcliffe Award. One of such disputes was Berubari Dispute. Radcliffe had divided the district of Jalpaigudi between India and Pakistan by awarding some thanas to one country and others to the other country. The boundary line was determined based on the boundaries of the thanas. In describing this boundary, Radcliffe omitted to mention one Thana. Berubari Union No. 12 lies within Jalpaigudi thana which was awarded to India. However, the omission of the Thana Boda and the erroneous depiction on the map enabled Pakistan to claim that a part of Berubari belonged to it. This dispute was resolved by Nehru-Noon Agreement of 1958, whereby half of Berubari Union No. 12 was to be given to Pakistan and the other half adjacent to India was to be retained by India. In addition, four Cooch Behar enclaves contiguous of this part would also have gone to Pakistan.\n\nNow the question arose, regarding the power of the parliament to transfer the territory of Berubari to Pakistan. This is where we come to learn about the Beru-Bari union case of 1960. And also, the famous 9th Constitutional Amendment Act. The matter whether parliament has the power to cede a region to a foreign country was brought to the supreme court. It declared that cessation to a foreign country would require special constitutional amendment procedures under Article 368 than the otherwise mentioned simple constitutional procedure mentioned in Article 4.\n\nYet another internal struggle that India had to face was regarding the inclusion of regions which were still under the foreign power.\n\nDadra and Nagar Haveli\n\nThe Portuguese ruled this territory until its liberation in 1954. Subsequently, the administration was carried on till 1961 by an administrator chosen by the people themselves. It was converted into a union territory of India by the 10th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1961.\n\nAnnexation of Goa\n\nIn 1961, after continual petitions for a peaceful handover, India invaded and annexed the Portuguese colony of Goa on the west coast. India acquired the three territories of Goa, Daman& Diu and formed them into a union territory.\n\nIndo-China War (1962)\n\nWhile integration and cessation of territories were going on one side, on the other side there were other major issues erupting to be faced by India. In the last video, we had discussed the Tibetan uprising and fleeing of Dalai Lama as one of the triggers for Indo-China war. Well, the year had finally come when things between us and China were to get worse. But before getting into that let us look into the actual matters leading to Indo-China War.\n\nThe battle was over the disputed borderland areas of Aksai chin and Arunanchal Pradesh. India claimed Aksai Chin to be a part of Ladakh (it is a huge desert of a salt flat which has been under Chinese occupation since the 1950s). Though not demarcated, these borders were well defined by various treaties and usage right from the seventeenth century. Yet another sign of discord between India and China was the invasion of Tibet by China. The Tibetans looked up to India for help but India\u2019s feeble protest (considering our Panchsheel Policy) merely antagonised the Chinese without helping the Tibetans. On the contrary, China illegally occupied the Aksai Chin and completed construction of its Western Highway through it in 1957.\n\nTo counter continued Chinese aggression, India embarked on a policy, called \u2018Forward Policy\u2019, of establishing a series of small posts all along its Northern and Eastern borders with China, to prevent further incursions. However, most posts were not capable of giving a fight to the Chinese and were logistically unsustainable.\n\nIn 1962 China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army invades India in Ladakh, and across the McMahon Line in the then North-East Frontier Agency (now Arunachal Pradesh), inflicting heavy damage on Indian forces.\n\nOn 10th October The Sino-Indian War, a border dispute involving two of the world\u2019s largest nations (between India and the People\u2019s Republic of China) begins.\n\nOn 20th October Chinese troops invade Kashmir and capture Aksai Chin.\n\nWorld affairs\n\nWhile India and China were busy fighting each other, serious intervention of soviet and the US in this matter was halted because of another major event happening simultaneously in the timeline which was the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nBut before we start to discuss the Cuban missile crisis, let us quickly go through a few world events in the past that needs mentioning here to connect to things upcoming. One of such events was the Suez Crisis.\n\nSuez Crisis\n\nThe Suez Crisis began on October 29, 1956, when Israeli armed forces pushed into Egypt toward the Suez Canal after Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser (1918-70) nationalized the canal, a valuable waterway that controlled two-thirds of the oil used by Europe. The Israelis were soon joined by French and British forces. At the same time, the Soviets, eager to exploit Arab nationalism and gain a foothold in the Middle East, supplied arms from Czechoslovakia to the Egyptian government beginning in 1955 and eventually helped Egypt construct the Aswan Dam on the Nile River after the United States refused to support the project. \u00a0This nearly brought the Soviet Union into the conflict and damaged their relationships with the United States. In the end, Egypt emerged victoriously, and the British, French and Israeli governments withdrew their troops in late 1956 and early 1957. The event was a pivotal event among Cold War superpowers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Suez Crisis, Britain and France, once the seat of empires, found their influence as world powers weakened as the United States and the Soviet Union took a more powerful role in world affairs. British Prime Minister Anthony Eden resigned two months after withdrawing British troops\n\nThe crisis made Nasser a powerful hero in the growing Arab and Egyptian nationalist movements. Israel, while it did not gain the right to utilize the canal, was once again granted rights to ship goods along the Straits of Tiran.\n\nTen years later, Egypt shut down the canal following the Six-Day War (June 1967 to be discussed in the following section). For almost a decade, the Suez Canal became the front line between the Israeli and Egyptian armies.\n\nInternational India\nIndia too had voiced its opinion during this crisis. In 1956, when the Suez Canal Company was seized by the Egyptian government, an international conference voted 18\u20134 to take action against Egypt. India was one of the four backers of Egypt, along with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the USSR.\nIndia had opposed the partition of Palestine and the 1956 invasion of the Sinai by Israel, the United Kingdom and France, but did not oppose the pro-democracy movement in Hungary by the Soviet Union.\nIndia\u2019s prominent stand on various international events brought it under the limelight as the voice of the emerging voice of the third world countries. Which reminds us of an important contribution that India and other emerging countries had for the world divided into two blocs. i.e. NAM.\nNon-Aligned Movement\nDrawing on the principles agreed at the Bandung Conference in 1955, the NAM was established in 1961 in Belgrade, SR Serbia, Yugoslavia through an initiative of the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito. It showcased the stand of these countries regarding their neutral stand and willingness to keep away from super-bloc politics and alignments.\nThe term non-aligned movement first appears in the fifth conference in 1976, where participating countries are denoted as \u201cmembers of the movement\u201d.\nThe purpose of the organization was to ensure \u201cthe national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of non-aligned countries\u201d in their \u201cstruggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, and all forms of foreign aggression, occupation, domination, interference or hegemony as well as against great power and bloc politics\nCuban Missile Crisis of 1962\n\nMeanwhile, NAM was speaking about the spirit of keeping neutral the two main power blocs were busy in the Cuban missile crisis.\n\nAfter seizing power in the Caribbean island nation of Cuba in 1959, leftist revolutionary leader Fidel Castro (1926-2016) aligned himself with the Soviet Union. Under Castro, Cuba grew dependent on the Soviets for military and economic aid. During this time, the U.S. and the Soviets (and their respective allies) were engaged in the Cold War (1945-91), an ongoing series of largely political and economic clashes. The two superpowers plunged into one of their biggest Cold War confrontations after an American pilot photographed a Soviet SS-4 medium-range ballistic missile being assembled for installation in Cuba. They took this as an alarming situation for nuclear missiles were being installed too close to the US, leading to a crisis and stand-off.\nBack to India\n\nSo, let\u2019s come back to the point where we had left. While we were discussing Indo-China war another side by side happening was the incorporation of Pondicherry into India (officially).\n\nTill 1962 the territory of Pondicherry was administered as an \u2018acquired territory\u2019 and was made a union territory by the 14th Constitutional Amendment Act. The territory of Puducherry comprising the former French establishments in India known as Puducherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam was handed over to India in 1954. However, their official incorporation happened only in 1962.\nIn 1963 (13th Constitutional Amendment Act), the Naga Hills district became the 16th state of India under the name of Nagaland. Part of Tuensang was added to Nagaland. Nagaland became a state on 1 December 1963.\nThe economic situation in India\nThe introduction of modern production techniques, which require proportionately greater capital, was the main feature of the development of the Indian economy during the decade, 1950-60. However, this modern sector had not yet become large enough to affect the overall structure of the economy.\nLargescale manufacturing industry was the only sector of the economy to adopt advanced modern techniques to a marked extent to affect the capital structure of the sector as a whole. In other sectors, despite there being a rise in the incremental capital-output ratios, the overall capital-output structure remained largely unchanged.\nThe quest to quickly industrialize had caused a large reallocation of funds away from the farm sector.\nAgriculture outlay was nearly halved to 14% in the Second Plan. Food shortages worsened, and inflation spiked. Imports of food grains depleted precious foreign exchange reserves.\nBeginning in 1950, India had faced trade deficits that increased in the 1960s. The Government of India had a major budget deficit and therefore could not borrow money internationally or privately.\nAs a result, the government issued bonds to the Reserve Bank of India, which increased the money supply, leading to inflation.\nThe war with China had exposed India\u2019s economic weakness. Chronic food shortages and price rise convinced him that India needed to move away from centralized planning and price controls.\n\nThis was a huge pressure to handle for a nascent economy emerging out of colonial deprivations.\n\nInstitutional and legislative advancements in the 1960s\n\nMeanwhile, we discuss the Indian economic scenario after the war, many institutional and important legislative developments had happened on the way.\n\nBefore we move on to specific legislative details of the 1960s let us quickly go through a few important legislations of 1950s that we missed in the previous video.\n\nthe establishment of Khadi and Village Industries Commission Act, 1956 \u2013 It is an apex organisation under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, concerning khadi and village industries within India, which seeks to \u2013 \u201cplan, promote, facilitate, organise and assist in the establishment and development of khadi and village industries in the rural areas in coordination with other agencies engaged in rural development wherever necessary\nMines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957\u2013 The Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act (1957) is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted to regulate the mining sector in India. It was amended in 2015 and 2016. This act applies to all mineral except minor minerals and atomic minerals. It details the process and conditions for acquiring a mining or prospecting licence in India. Mining minor minerals come under the purview of state governments.\nArmed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958\u2013 to grant special powers to the Indian Armed Forces the power to maintain public order in \u201cdisturbed areas\u201d.\nThe new idea of bringing justice not just to humans but also animals was mentioned via the prevention of cruelty act, 1960\nWelfare measure via maternity benefit Act, 1961\u2013 protects the employment of women during the time of her maternity and entitles her of a \u2018maternity benefit\u2019 \u2013 i.e. full paid absence from work \u2013 to take care for her child. The act applies to all establishments employing 10 or more employees. Recently major amendments were introduced into this act like increasing the maternity leave to 26 weeks, providing work from home options, creche facility for institutions employing more than 50 employees and compulsory education about maternity benefits.\nIIT Act, 1961:In order to drive India\u2019s economic development and to build industry, the idea for India to have scientists and engineers was considered important. It was recommended to create higher technical institutions, based on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology model, following which five institutes of technology (IIT) were established at Kharagpur (1950), Bombay (1958, with assistance from UNESCO and the Soviet Union), Kanpur (1959, with a consortium of US universities), Madras (1959, with the government of West Germany) and Delhi (1961, with the UK). Later, the IIT Act was enacted on 19 December 1961 to \u201cdeclare certain institutions of technology to be institutions of national importance. The list also includes NITs and AIIMS, in addition to the IITs. The Institute of technology Act, 1961 was passed.\n1963: the establishment of CBI\nPolitical scenario in India (after Nehru)\n1964: Jawaharlal Nehru died on 27 May 1964.\n\nLal Bahadur Shastri succeeded Nehru as Prime Minister. Soon after his taking over of prime ministership, he had to face another major trouble of 2nd Indo-Pak War.\n\n1965: 2nd Indo-Pak war\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a culmination of skirmishes that took place between April 1965 and September 1965 between Pakistan and India.\nThe conflict began following Pakistan\u2019s Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule.\nIndia retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan.\nHostilities between the two countries ended after a United Nations-mandated ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration.\nMuch of the war was fought by the countries\u2019 land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan.\nThe economic and social side\nBy the time Shastri took over as PM, the failure of the third Five-Year Plan was clear.\nGrowth in national income barely kept pace with population growth, the prices rose substantially, and food grain became scarce.\nHe tried to lower the role of Planning Commission whose five-year plans and involvements in the Indian economy was not paying better results than expected.\nConsidering the economic stagnation that India was in Shastri wanted to promote agrarian growth in contrast to the earlier focus on heavy industries.\nIt was him who brought the technocrat minister Subramaniam to obtain suggestions for improving current stagnant scenario. Subramaniam emphasised on promoting the private sector, technological innovation, and foreign investment amidst a hostile leftist consensus.\nSubramaniam proposed the market-oriented approach to increase production and also favoured use of chemical fertilizers. Based on his intervention the Food Corporation of India Act was passed in 1964.\nThere was a shift from social to technological reform in agriculture.\nAfter the 1965 India-Pakistan war, Subramaniam came up with a three-pronged plan to improve the agrarian economy. He advocated the use of High Yielding Variety seeds, price incentives to farmers and focused use of improved farming inputs into irrigated areas and this ultimately led to the green revolution in India.\nSoon after the war, which ended with the Tashkent Agreement in 1966, huge efforts were laid to restore the falling economic parameters.\nAfter the war, a shaky economy forced annual plans in place of the five-year plan. India suspended five-year plans briefly, drawing up annual plans between 1966 and 1969 instead. This was done as the country was not in a position to commit resources over a longer period.\nThe war with China, the below-par growth outcomes of the third Plan, and the diversion of capital to finance the war with Pakistan had left the economy severely weakened.\nWorld: Major Happenings in the 1960s\n\nThe beginning of the next decade was marked with a great number of civil rights and human rights protests and movements at a bigger scale.\n\n1960\nBeginning of Anti-apartheid movement in the UK, against the discrimination policy of South Africa.\nCivil Rights Movement in the US:\nThe civil rights movement was the first of the 1960s-era social movements. This movement produced one of the most important American social activists of the 20th century, Martin Luther King, Jr.\nIt originated among black Americans in the South who faced racial discrimination and segregation, or the separation of whites and blacks, in almost every aspect of their lives.\n\u00a0In 1960 black Southerners often had to sit in the back of public buses, were refused service in most restaurants and hotels, and still went to racially segregated schools, despite the 1954 Supreme Court ruling, Brown v. Board of Education, which outlawed racially segregated education. Employment ads were separated into \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d categories, and black Southerners were openly restricted to the lowest paying and lowest status occupations. Besides, most black Southerners were effectively denied the right to vote.\nBlacks fought in the courts, lobbied elected officials, and began a sustained campaign of nonviolent direct action. Many blacks participated in major demonstrations.\nIn 1964, pressured by the civil rights movement and under the leadership of President Lyndon Johnson, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited segregation in public accommodations and made discrimination in education and employment illegal. In 1965 Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which suspended the use of any voter qualification devices that prevented blacks from voting.\n\nThis is very important to remember considering the current escalation of black rights violation and demand for upholding human rights even now in this century where everyone believes that we have done away with old hard customs and practices.\n\n1961\nEstablishment of the World Food Programme: The world after world war II had yet to emerge from severe hunger and food shortage all across the globe. It was in 1961 that the first world food programme was launched. is the food-assistance branch of the United Nations and the world\u2019s largest humanitarian organization addressing hunger and promoting food security. WFP was established in 1961 after the 1960 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Conference and formally came into force in 1963. The WFP strives to eradicate hunger and malnutrition, with the ultimate goal in mind of eliminating the need for food aid itself.\n1962\nUN passes UN Resolution 1761 condemning apartheid.\nIncreased US presence and involvement in Vietnam\nThe Vietnam War was a long, costly and divisive conflict that pitted the communist government of North Vietnam against South Vietnam and its principal ally, the United States. The Vietnam War and active U.S. involvement in the war began in 1954, though ongoing conflict in the region had stretched back several decades. In 1954, after the battle of Dien Bien Phu (where the communist north won), at the Geneva Conference Vietnam was splitted along the 17th parallel as North and south Vietnam. However, by 1960 many opponents (both communist and non-communist) rose in South Vietnam, opposing the current system. From 1961 onwards America started building\u2013up its military, technical and economic aid to suppress such a threat against the US favoured ally Diem in S. Vietnam. Soon after a coup rose in South and Diem was executed. The US soon retaliated with bombing raids across N. Vietnam (codenamed Operation Rolling Thunder). This bombing was not just limited to Vietnam but it bombed the neutral state of Laos too. By 1965, US combats were sent to Vietnam.\nBy 1966, large areas of South Vietnam had been designated as \u201cfree-fire zones,\u201d from which all innocent civilians were supposed to have evacuated and only enemy remained. In all of this, a huge number of civilian lives were lost.\nThis also resulted in a major protest led mostly by students against the US intervention in Vietnam. the student movement worked primarily to fight racism and poverty, increase student rights, and to end the Vietnam War.\n1966\nIn China: While this was happening in the US and SE Asia, in China under Mao Zedong another major cultural revolution was taking place. The Cultural Revolution was launched in China in 1966 by Communist leader Mao Zedong in order to reassert his authority over the Chinese government. Mao called on the nation\u2019s youth to purge the \u201cimpure\u201d elements of Chinese society and revive the revolutionary spirit that had led to victory in the civil war 20 years earlier and the formation of the People\u2019s Republic of China. A personality cult quickly sprang up around Mao. Some 1.5 million people were killed during the Cultural Revolution, and millions of others suffered imprisonment, seizure of property, torture or general humiliation.\n1967\nMeanwhile, in INDIA we see the Naxalbari uprising in the year the following year of 1967 under the leadership of Charu Majumdar. The details of which will be discussed later in the following section.\nSix-day War:\n\nAnother major incident that was happening meanwhile in 1967 was the Six-Day War between Israel and Egypt.\n\nSix-Day War, also called June War or Third Arab-Israeli War or Naksah, brief war that took place June 5\u201310, 1967, and was the third of the Arab-Israeli wars.\nRelations between Israel and its neighbours were not normalised after the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War.\nIn 1956 Israel invaded the Sinai-peninsula in Egypt, with one of its objectives being the reopening of the Straits of Tiran that Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950.\n\u00a0Israel was eventually forced to withdraw but was guaranteed that the Straits of Tiran would remain open.\nA United Nations Emergency Force was deployed along the border, but there was no demilitarisation agreement.\nIn the months before June 1967, tensions became dangerously heightened. Israel reiterated its post-1956 position that the closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping would be a cause for war.\nThis was not taken heed of and Egypt proceeded with the closing and ultimately war broke out. Read more about the Israel-Palestine conflict here.\nThe environmental scenario in the 1960s\n1961: WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) is created. Living Planet Index (since 1998, once in two years); earth hour and debt-for-nature-swap.\n1962: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil (1954), London was updated. Administered by IMO.\n1963: The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is signed by the U.S., the U.K. and the U.S.S.R.\nVienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, Vienna 1963. It came into force in 1977.\nIndia \u2013 civil liability for nuclear damage Act, 2010 after making amendments in the Atomic Energy Act, 1962.\n1964: IUCN publishes its First Red Data Book.\nScience and technological advancement in India during the 1960s\nNuclear technology during this period\nThe roots of nuclear power in India lie in the early acquisition of nuclear reactor technology from several western countries, particularly the American support for the Tarapur Atomic Power Station.\nOn 11 October 1960, the Indian government issued a tender for India\u2019s first nuclear power station near\u00a0Tarapur, Maharashtra and consisting of two reactors, each generating around 150 MW of electricity and to be commissioned in 1965\nIn 1961 Indian and Canadian governments agreed on conducting a joint study on building Canada-India nuclear power plant- based on CANDU reactor\nSpace and telecom sector:\nThe Indian space program received only financial support from the Soviet Union, which helped the Indian Space Research Organisation achieve aims such as establishing the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.\nThe Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was established by Jawaharlal Nehru under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in 1962, with the urging of scientist Vikram Sarabhai recognizing the need in space research. INCOSPAR grew and became ISRO in 1969, also under the DAE\nThe first attempt to develop an indigenous electronic exchange was initiated at the Telecom Research Centre in the 1960s and the first breakthrough was a 100 line electronic switch developed in 1973.\nDepartment of Electronics was established in 1970.\nIndia after Shastri\nAfter signing the Tashkent Agreement to end the Indo-Pak struggle. India faced another major loss in the form of death of Lal Bahadur Shastri, who died on the night after the signing ceremony. After this starts yet another era of Indian political history.\nAfter Shastri\u2019s death, a leadership election resulted in the elevation of Indira Gandhi, Nehru\u2019s daughter who had been serving as Minister for Information and Broadcasting, as the third Prime Minister. She defeated right-wing leader Morarji Desai.\nThe Congress Party won a reduced majority in the 1967 elections owing to widespread disenchantment over rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation, and food crisis.\nIndira Gandhi had started on a rocky note after agreeing to a devaluation of the rupee, which created much hardship for Indian businesses and consumers, and the import of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes.\nMajor policies under Indira Gandhi\nGandhi inherited a weak and troubled economy\nFiscal problems associated with the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence.\nShe started with the devaluing of money, in return for the restoration of foreign aid. It created hardship for Indian businesses and consumers.\nIndia also had a humiliating defeat in the 1962 war with China. It necessitated India to strengthen its defence. India had to import a lot of arms from foreign countries. This again depleted India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves to a dangerously low level of 625 million dollars in march 1966. To get out of this situation, the rupee was devalued from Rs. 4.76 to Rs. 7.50.\nThe devaluation was aimed at boosting exports and bringing in foreign capital into the country. It was a necessary measure to avoid a looming financial crisis in India. It was a step in the right direction of reforming the economy but the further process of liberalisation could not be carried out due to widespread opposition from left parties and even within the congress.\nThe importation of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes.\nFollowing the 1967 elections, Gandhi gradually began to move towards socialist policies.\nIn 1967 the Ten-point program of Gandhi is released. It emphasized greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.\nBy the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalization process was complete, and India\u2019s policies were characterized as \u201cprotectionist as ever\u201d.\nThe Green Revolution in India subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s and transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains and prone to famine to being largely able to feed itself, and become successful in achieving its goal of food security.\nThe economy managed to recover in 1966 and ended up growing at 4.1% over 1966\u20131969\nIndira Gandhi and Agriculture\n\nGandhi\u2019s government resolved never again to become \u201cso vulnerably dependent\u201d on aid and painstakingly began building up substantial foreign exchange reserves. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India\u2019s dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.\n\nFinally, except for devaluation, no other liberalising procedures could continue in the Indian economic scenario.\n\nPolitical turmoil during the mid-1960s\nSikh-Homeland Movement and formation of Punjab:\nDuring her tenure, another major internal or regional issue to the surface was the rising Sikh Homeland movement (which was building up since the time of Nehru).\nIn 1966, the State of Punjab was bifurcated to create Haryana, the 17th state of the Indian Union, and the union territory of Chandigarh. This followed the demand for a separate \u2018Sikh Homeland\u2019 (the demand for the sovereign Sikh state was on since the early 1940s) raised by the Akali Dal under the leadership of Master Tara Singh. On the recommendation of the Shah Commission (1966), the Punjabi- speaking areas were constituted into the unilingual state of Punjab, the Hindi-speaking areas were constituted into the State of Haryana and the hill areas were merged with the adjoining union territory of Himachal Pradesh.\nNaxalbari movement:\n\nMeanwhile, in the east, the Naxalbari uprising had happened in 1967. Naxalbari uprising was an armed peasant revolt in 1967 in the Naxalbari block of the Siliguri subdivision in Darjeeling district, West Bengal, India. It was mainly led by local tribals and the radical communist leaders of Bengal and further developed into Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist) in 1969. The event became an inspiration to the Naxalite movement which rapidly spread from West Bengal to other states of India creating division within the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) party.\n\nImportant economic measures (1965 onwards)\nMonopolies and Restrictive Trade Practice (MRTP) Act of 1969- The act came into force from 1st June 1970. The act aims to prevent the concentration of economic power, provide for control of monopolies, and protect consumer interest.\nNationalization of fourteen large commercial banks in 1969- the 14 banks held 85 per cent of bank deposits in the country at that time. The core objective for nationalization was to energize priority sectors at a time when the large businesses dominated credit profiles. Even though the banks lent credit, the disbursal to the rural areas and small scale borrowers was far less as compared to the industry despite the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\nThe Patent Act of 1970- passed in 1970, came into force on 20th April 1972, replacing the Indian Patents and Designs Act 1911. The Patents Act was largely based on the recommendations of the Ayyangar Committee Report. One of the recommendations was the allowance of only process patents concerning inventions relating to drugs, medicines, food and chemicals.\nThe Industrial Licensing Policy of 1970\nThe policy defines a sector called heavy investment sector. It consisted of industries involving an investment of more than Rs 5 crore. All such industries were opened for private sector except those reserved for the public sector in IPR, 1956.\nIndustries involving investment between Rs 1 crore and 5 crores were included in the middle sector. The licensing policy was considerably liberalised and simplified for these industries\nThe setting up of Industries involving an investment of less than Rs 1 crore does not require any license.\nTo be continued\u2026\n\nThe timeline study of the current video ends here.\n\nThis is to be continued with another period of timeline studies via crossroads at CearIAS.\n\nSubscribe to ClearIAS YouTube Channel, and click on the \u2018bell icon\u2019 to receive notifications about the new updates.\n\nLecture by: Honey Mathew"

        "[CONTENT]": "What caused the Bangladesh liberation war of 1971? What was India\u2019s role and significance in it? Read to know all about the Indo-Pak war of 1971 here.\n\nThe war of 1971 or the Indo-Pak war of 1971 or the Bangladesh Liberation war of 1971 was a revolution and armed conflict sparked by the rise of the Bengali nationalist and self-determination movement in what was then East Pakistan.\n\nThis war resulted in the independence of Bangladesh from West Pakistan.\n\nThe background events of the Indo-Pak War of 1971 are summarised below.\n\nAlso read: Village defence communities\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat led to the Indo-Pak War, 1971?\nLanguage controversy\nPolitical imbalance\nCultural differences\n6 point movement, 1966\nOperation Searchlight\nBengali resistance- the Mukhti Bahini\nTimeline of Indo Pak war 1971\nHow did the Indo Pak War 1971 shape today\u2019s India-Bangladesh relations?\nWhat led to the Indo-Pak War, 1971?\n\nHistorically, the seeds of trouble were sown in 1905 when Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal based on religion. East Bengal was Muslim dominant region while the west was Hindu-dominated.\n\nAfter the 1947 partition of India, East Bengal became a province of Pakistan and was called East Pakistan then onwards. The east and west Pakistan were not only separated geographically, but they differed in language, culture, etc also. This led to problems in governance as well. The only common ground between the two provinces was religion,\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nLanguage controversy\nIn 1948, Jinnah declared that Urdu will the official language and the people of East Pakistan who were bangle speaking, will have to comply.\nThis led to widespread protests in East Pakistan and the \u201cLanguage Movement\u201d began for the right of Bengalis to use Bangla as their official language.\nThis movement was led by Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, who joined the Awami League party.\nThe struggle against the Muslim league\u2019s Urdu imposition continued till the 1960s.\n\nNote: The UN celebrates the International Mother Language Day on 21st February in commemoration of the 1952 police firing on language rallies in East Bengal.\n\nPolitical imbalance\nThe Pakistan administration was dominated by West Pakistan and the Bengalis had no political say in the process.\nEast Pakistan had more population than the west but received lower budget allotments.\nBengalis were underrepresented in every aspect of administration and military.\nCultural differences\nWest Pakistan was dominated by the Punjabi and Pashtun ethnicity, while the east Pakistanis gave more importance to the Bengali ethnicity over religious identity.\nThe population of Hindus was also more in the east than the west, hence they were considered less loyal by the west Pakistan administration.\nWest Pakistanis were more supportive of an Islamic state than East Pakistanis.\nThe Bengalis took great pride in their culture and language which, with its\u00a0Bengali script\u00a0and\u00a0vocabulary, was unacceptable to the West Pakistani elite, who believed that it had assimilated considerable Hindu cultural influences.\n\nThe 1954 provincial elections saw landslide victory of Mujibur Rehman\u2019s Awami League over the Muslim league. However, west Pakistan was not willing to let a leader from its eastern provincial wing rule the country.\n\nRiots exploded in the province and using this instability as an excuse, the central government established the governor\u2019s rule in the province overturning the election results.\n\nIn 1956, Pakistan finally got its constitution, and Pakistan was declared the Islamic Republic. The national parliament was to comprise of one house with equal representation from east and West Pakistan.\n\n6 point movement, 1966\nThis was a movement in east Pakistan spearheaded by Mujibir Rahman demanding greater autonomy for the region.\nTheir 6 demands were: Federal state, all subjects except defence and foreign affairs, separate currency and fiscal policy, taxation powers, trade, and forex reserves, separate military and navy.\n\nAgartala conspiracy case, 1968: Mujibur Rahman went to Agartala to seek Indian support for East Pakistan\u2019s independence. Pakistan charged him with sedition and conspiring with India charges.\n\n1970 Cyclone Bhola caused floods and 3-5 lakhs deaths in East Pakistan, but the Yahya Khan\u2019s government did not provide adequate relief. This added to the animosity between the two regions.\n\nThe 1970 election again saw sweeping victory by the Awami League, but Zulfikar Bhutto-led PPP who won in West Pakistan refused to acknowledge Mujibur Rahman\u2019s win.\n\nThis led to civil disobedience and a call for independence in Dhaka and on 23 March 1971 flag of Bangladesh was raised for the first time.\n\nOperation Searchlight\nOn 25th March 1971, the Pakistan army struck at the Bengali independence movement at night.\nMujibur Rahman was arrested and flown to West Pakistan, many Bengali students and intellectuals were fired upon and arrested in Dhaka University.\nThis resulted in millions of Bangladeshis fleeing to India, mainly West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura.\nWest Bengal was massively burdened by the rush of the refugees and the state appealed to the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for assistance for food and shelter.\nBengali resistance- the Mukhti Bahini\n\nThe Bengali armed resistance Mukhti Bahini arose against the Pakistan army and the Indian forces helped them with arms and training.\n\nIndia had a very crucial geopolitical motive to help Bangladesh due to the turbulent relationship with Pakistan. A win for the Bengali movement meant a peaceful eastern frontier for India. And as an immediate reason, the refugee crisis was becoming a huge economic burden for India.\n\nOn the global scale, the U.S \u2013Soviet tensions were high. India had signed a Friendship treaty with Russia hence the U.S was supporting Pakistan throughout all this.\n\nThe war was on the doorstep now.\n\nTimeline of Indo Pak war 1971\n\nDecember 3: Operation Chengiz Khan by Pakistan Air Force launched airstrikes against Indian airfields in the Western Sector, including Amritsar, Pathankot, Srinagar, Avantipura, Ambala, Sirsa, Halwara, Agra\n\nDecember 3 to 6:\u00a0Indian Air Force retaliates by attacking Pakistan air bases in Western and Eastern sectors. Pakistan attacks Indian ground positions in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir\n\nDecember 4:\u00a0Battle of Longewala takes place in Rajasthan where Pakistani advance towards Jaisalmer is thwarted\n\nDecember 5: Battle of Ghazipur in East Pakistan. Battle of Basantar in the Western sector in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab in the Shakargarh salient near Sialkot. Battle of Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district of Punjab\n\nDecember 6: India formally recognizes Bangladesh as an independent nation.

As many as 93,000 Pakistani troops lay down their arms in Bangladesh.\n\nMujirbur Rahman was released from prison in January and went on to become the first Prime Minister of Bangladesh.\n\nShimla Agreement was signed between India and Pakistan on 2nd July 1972- The LoC was recognized, India gave back occupied land back to Pakistan, PoWs were repatriated and the Kashmir issue was agreed to be discussed peacefully.\n\nHow did the Indo Pak War 1971 shape today\u2019s India-Bangladesh relations?\n\nThe Indo-Pak war of 1971 liberated Bangladesh and established a friendly neighbourhood on the eastern front for India. Bangladesh is India\u2019s largest trading partner in South Asia and one of the fastest-growing economies. Indian firms have huge investment opportunities in the country due to their growth potential. Bangladesh is crucial for India\u2019s connectivity and peace in the north-eastern states.\n\nIndia had recently inaugurated the new trade corridor, Maitri Setu Bridge from Sabroom in India to Ramgargh in Bangladesh on the Feni river in Tripura-Bangladesh border.\nBangabandhu Mujibur Rahman was awarded the Gandhi Peace Prize 2021.\nBangladesh was a special invitee to India\u2019s 75th independence day celebrations and President Kovind is part of Victory day celebrations in Bangladesh.\nBangladesh marked 50 years of liberation war victory over Pakistan on 16th December 2021.\nThe nation celebrated victory in the 1971 war for independence by hosting a military parade with India\u2019s president as a guest of honour.\n\nBangladesh has a special place in India\u2019s neighbourhood first policy and the relation is ever more crucial in the current geopolitical scenario as well."

Period I, Upper\u00a0Palaeolithic; Period II, Mesolithic; and Period III,\u00a0Chalcolithic. After Period III there are four\u00a0successive periods. But we will confine\u00a0ourselves here only to the first three phases.\u00a0Prehistoric Era art denotes the art (mainly rock paintings) during Paleolithic Age, Mesolithic Age and Chalcolithic Age.\n\n(1) Paleolithic Age Art\nThe prehistoric period in the early development of human beings is commonly known as the \u2018Old Stone Age\u2019 or \u2018Palaeolithic Age\u2019.\nThe Paleolithic period can be divided into three phases:\n(1) Lower Palaeolithic (2.5 million years-100,000 years ago)\n(2) Middle Palaeolithic (300,000-30,000 years ago)\n(3) Upper Palaeolithic (40,000-10,000 years ago)\nWe did not get any evidence of paintings from lower or middle paleolithic age yet.\nIn the Upper Palaeolithic period, we see a proliferation of artistic activities.\nSubjects of early works confined to simple human figures, human activities, geometric designs, and symbols.\nFirst discovery of rock paintings in the world was made in India (1867-68) by an Archaeologist, Archibold Carlleyle, twelve years before the discovery of Altamira in Spain (site of oldest rock paintings in the world).\nIn India, remnants of rock paintings have been found on the walls of caves situated in several districts of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Bihar, and Uttarakhand.\nSome of the examples of sites early rock paintings are Lakhudiyar in Uttarakhand, Kupgallu in Telangana, Piklihal and Tekkalkotta in Karnataka, Bhimbetka and Jogimara in Madhya Pradesh etc.\nPaintings found here can be divided into three categories: Man, Animal, and Geometric symbols.\nSome of the characteristics of these early paintings are:\nHuman beings are represented in a stick-like form.\nA long-snouted animal, a fox, a multi-legged lizard are main animal motifs in the early paintings (later many animals were drawn).\nWavy lines, rectangular filled geometric designs and a group of dots also can be seen.\nSuperimposition of paintings \u2013 earliest is Black, then red and later White.\nIn the late historic, early historic and Neolithic period the subjects of paintings developed and figures like Bulls, Elephants, Sambhars, Gazelles, Sheep, Horses, styled human beings, tridents and rarely vegetal motifs began to see.\nThe richest paintings are reported from Vindhya range of Madhya Pradesh and their Kaimurean extension into U.P.\nThese hills are fully Palaeolithic and Mesolithic remains.\nThere are two major sites of excellent prehistoric paintings in India:\n(1) Bhimbetka Caves, Foothills of Vindhya, Madhya Pradesh.\n(2) Jogimara caves, Amarnath, Madhya Pradesh.\nBHIMBETKA CAVES\n\nContinuous occupation of the caves from 100,000 B.C\u2013 1000 A.D\nThus, it is considered as an evidence of long cultural continuity.\nIt was discovered in 1957-58.\nConsists of nearly 400 painted rock shelters in five clusters.\nOne of the oldest paintings in India and the world (Upper paleolithic).\nThe features of paintings of three different phases are as follows (even though Bhimbetka contains many paintings of periods later, different from what is explained below, as we are dealing with the prehistoric period only, we are concluding by these three):\n\u00a0UPPER PALAEOLITHIC PERIOD:\nPaintings are linear representations, in green and dark red, of huge animal figures, such as Bisons, Tigers, Elephants, Rhinos and Boars beside stick-like human figures.\nMostly they are filled with geometric patterns.\nGreen paintings are of dances and red ones of hunters.\n(2) Mesolithic period Art:\nThe largest number of paintings belongs to this period.\nThemes multiply but the paintings are small in size.\nHunting scenes predominate\nHunters in groups armed with barbed spears pointed sticks, arrows, and bows.\nTrap and snares used to catch animals can be seen in some paintings.\nMesolithic people loved to point animals.\nIn some pictures, animals are chasing men and in others, they are being chased by hunter men.\nAnimals painted in a naturalistic style and humans were depicted in a stylistic manner.\nWomen are painted both in nude and clothed.\nYoung and old equally find places in paintings.\nCommunity dances provide a common theme.\nSort of family life can be seen in some paintings (woman, man, and children).\n(3) Chalcolithic period Art:\nCopper age art.\nThe paintings of this period reveal the association, contact and mutual exchange of requirements of the cave dwellers of this area with settled agricultural communities of the Malwa Plateau.\nPottery and metal tools can be seen in paintings.\nSimilarities with rock paintings: Common motifs (designs/patterns like cross-hatched squares, lattices etc)\nThe difference with rock paintings: Vividness and vitality of older periods disappear from these paintings.\nSome of the general features of Prehistoric paintings (based on the study of Bhimbetka paintings)\nUsed colours, including various shades of white, yellow, orange, red ochre, purple, brown, green and black.\nBut white and red were their favourite.\nThe paints used by these people were made by grinding various coloured rocks.\nThey got red from haematite (Geru in India).\nGreen prepared from a green coloured rock called Chalcedony.\nWhite was probably from Limestone.\nSome sticky substances such as animal fat or gum or resin from trees may be used while mixing rock powder with water.\nBrushes were made of plant fiber.\nIt is believed that these colours remained thousands of years because of the chemical reaction of the oxide present on the surface of rocks.\nPaintings were found both from occupied and unoccupied caves.\nIt means that these paintings were sometimes used also as some sort of signals, warnings etc.\nMany rock art sites of the new painting are painted on top of an older painting.\nIn Bhimbetka, we can see nearly 20 layers of paintings, one on top of another.\nIt shows the gradual development of the human being from period to period.\nThe symbolism is inspiration from nature along with slight spirituality.\nExpression of ideas through very few drawings (representation of men by the stick like drawings).\nUse of many geometrical patterns.\nScenes were mainly hunting and economic and social life of people.\nThe figure of flora, fauna, human, mythical creatures, carts, chariots etc can be seen.\nMore importance for red and white colours.\n\nCompiled by: Jijo Sudarshan"

After allowed to dry the clay, the whole thing is heated so that the wax inside the clay will be melted. The molten wax was then drained out through a tiny hole made in the clay part.

Once it cooled, the clay cover was completely removed].\n\nHuman as well as animal figures are present in the Bronze casting.\nAmongst animal figures the buffalo with its uplifted head, back and sweeping horns and the goat are artistic merits.\nCopper dog and bird of Lothal and the Bronze figure of a bull from Kalibangan shows that Bronze casting was popular at all centers of Indus valley civilization.\nMetal casting continued even after the Indus valley civilization through late Harappan, Chalcolithic people, etc.\nExamples of Bronze casting are:\nDancing Girl\nFound from Mohenjo-Daro.\nMade up of Bronze.\nOne of the best-known artifacts from Indus valley.\nApproximately 4-inch high figure of a dancing girl.\nThis exquisite casting depicts a girl whose long hair is tied in the bun and bangles cover her left arm.\nCowry shell necklace is seen around her neck.\nHer right hand is on her hip and her left hand is clasped in a traditional Indian dance gesture.\nShe has large eyes and flat nose.\nBull from Mohenjo-Daro\nBronze figure of the bull found in Mohenjo-Daro.\nThe massiveness of the bull and the fury of the charge are eloquently expressed.\nThe animal is shown standing with his head turned to the right.\nThere is a cord around the neck.\nTerracotta:\nTerracotta figures\u00a0are more realistic in Gujarat sites and Kalibangan.\nIn terracotta, we find a few figurines of bearded males with coiled hairs, their posture rigidly upright, legs slightly apart, and the arms parallel to the sides of the body. The repetition of this figure in exactly the same position would suggest that he was a deity.\nA terracotta mask of a horned deity has also been found.\nToy carts with wheels, whistles, rattles, bird and animals, gamesmen, and discs were also rendered in terracotta.\nThe most important terracotta figures are those represent Mother Goddess.\nMother Goddess\nMainly found in Mohenjo-Daro.\nThese figures are usually crude standing figures.\nAdorned with necklaces hanging over the prominent breast and wearing a loin cloth and a grid.\nThe fan-shaped headdress with a cup like projection on each side is a distinct decorative feature of the mother goddess.\nThe pellet eyes and beaked nose of the figure are very crude (constructed in a rudimentary way).\nMouth is indicated by a narrow opening.\nSeals:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThousands of seals were discovered from the sites, usually made of steatite, and occasionally of agate, chert, copper, faience and terracotta, with beautiful figures of animals such as unicorn bull, rhinoceros, tiger, elephant, bison, goat, buffalo, etc.\nThe purpose was mainly commercial.\nThey were also used as amulets, carried on the persons of their owners, perhaps as modern identity cards.\nStandard Harappan seal was 2 x 2 square inches.\nEvery seal is engraved in a pictographic script which is yet to be deciphered.\nSome seals were also been found in Gold and Ivory.\nSeals of Pashupati Mahadeva\nFound in Mohenjo-Daro.\nThe seal depicts a human figure seated cross legged.\nAn elephant and a tiger are depicted to the right side of the figure, while on the left a rhinoceros and a buffalo are seen.\nTwo antelopes (deer) are shown below the seat (nearby his feet).\nThe figure has a three horned head.\nPottery:\nIndus valley pottery consists of very fine wheel made wares, very few being handmade.\nPlain pottery is more common than painted ware.\nPlain pottery is generally red clay, with or without a fine red or grey slip.\nThe black painted ware has a fine coating of red slip on which geometric and animal designs are executed in glossy black paint.\nPainted Earthen Jar\nFound in Mohenjo-Daro.\nMade on a potters\u2019 wheel with clay.\nThe shape was manipulated by pressure of the crafty fingers of the potter.\nAfter baking a clay model, it was painted with black colour.\nHigh polishing was done as a finishing touch.\nMotifs are vegetal and geometric forms.\nDesigns are simple.\nBeads, Ornaments and Cosmetics:\nThe Harappan men and women decorated themselves with a large variety of ornaments produced from every conceivable materials ranging from precious metals and gemstones to bone and baked clay.\nWhite necklaces, fillets, armlets and finger rings were commonly worn by both sexes.\nJewellery found at Mohenjo-Daro and Lothal include necklaces of gold and semiprecious metal stones, copper bracelets and beads, gold earrings and head ornaments.\nA cemetery has been found at Farmona in Harappa where dead bodies were buried with ornaments.\nWell developed bead industries were present at Chauhudaro and Lothal.\nSome beads were made of two or more stones cemented together.\nAlso made models of animals, especially monkeys and squirrels, used as pin head and beads.\nSpinning of cotton and wool was very common (both rich and poor practiced spinning).\nMen and women wore two separate pieces of attire similar to dhoti and shawl.\nShawl covered the left shoulder passing below right arm.\nThey were conscious of fashion.\nDifferent hair styles were in vogue and beard was popular.\nCinnabar was used as a cosmetic and face-paint, lipstick and collyrium (eyeliner) were also known to them.\n\nCompiled by Jijo Sudashan"

However, this wheel is lying in broken condition and is displayed in the site museum of Sarnath.\nThe capital has four Asiatic lions seated back to back and their facial muscularity is very strong.\nThey symbolize power, courage, pride, and confidence.\nThe surface of the sculpture is heavily polished, which is typical of the Mauryan period.\nThe abacus (drum on the bell base) has the depiction of a chakra (wheel) in all four directions and a bull, a horse, an elephant, and a lion between every chakra.\nEach chakra has 24 spokes in it.\nThis 24-spoke chakra is adapted to the National Flag of India.\nThe circular abacus is supported by an inverted lotus capital.\nThe capital without the shaft, the lotus bell, and the crowning wheel have been adopted as the National Emblem of Independent India.\nIn the emblem adopted by Madhav Sawhney, only three Lions are visible, the fourth being hidden from view. The abacus is also set in such a way that only one chakra can be seen in the middle, with the bull on the right and the horse on the left.\nA lion capital has also been found at Sanchi\u00a0but is in a dilapidated condition.\nA pillar found at Vaishali is facing towards the north, which is the direction of Buddha\u2019s last voyage.\nYakshas and Yakshinis\nLarge statues of Yakshas and Yakshinis are found in many places like Patna, Vidisha, and Mathura.\nThey are mostly in the standing position.\nTheir polished surface is a distinguished element.\nDepiction of faces is in full round with pronounced cheeks and physiognomic detail.\nThey show sensitivity towards depicting the human physique.\nThe finest example is the Yakshi figure from Didarganj, Patna.\n\nDidarganj Yakshi\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam?

In other Buddhist traditions, the term is used for people far advanced along the path of Enlightenment, but who may not reach full Buddhahood).\nStupa-3 has the relics of Sariputta and Mahamoggallana/Mahamougalayana (disciples of Gautama Buddha).\nStupa-1 is the finest example of stupa architecture and is known for the carvings on its gateways (torans).\nOriginally it was a small brick structure that expanded over a period and was covered with stone, vedika (fence), and the Torans.\nThere is also the upper pradakshinapatha which is unique to this site (i.e., a total of two pradakshinapathas).\nThe four gateways are decorated profusely with sculptures.\nBuddha is shown symbolically as an empty throne, feet, chhatra, stupas, etc.\nTorans are constructed in all four directions.\nTheir stylistic differences indicate their possible chronology from the first century BCE onwards.\nThough stupa-1 is the oldest stupa, the carvings of images at the vedika of stupa-2 are earlier than those on stupa-1.\nJataka stories also became an important part of the narratives.\nThe figures in Sanchi despite being small in dimension are very naturalistic.\nThere are guardian images on sculptors and salabhanjika sculptures are remarkable in their volume (salabhanjika are sculptures of ladies holding the branch of a tree/plate etc.).\nEach torana consists of two vertical pillars and three horizontal bars on the top.\nEach horizontal bar is decorated with different sculptural themes on both sides.\nSupporting the extension of the lowermost horizontal bar from below are the images of Salabhanjikas.\nPost Mauryan Trends in Indian Art\n\nThe post-Mauryan period marked the emergence of various regional schools of art and the fusion of indigenous styles with external influences.\n\nMathura, Sarnath, Amaravati and Gandhara Schools\nGandhara Art: The post-Mauryan period saw the rise of Gandhara art, which was heavily influenced by Greco-Roman art due to the interactions with Hellenistic culture through trade and conquest. Gandhara art is characterized by its realistic and naturalistic depictions of Buddha and other deities, often with Greek-inspired drapery and features.\nMathura Art: The city of Mathura became a significant center for art during this period. Mathura\u2019s art focused on the portrayal of Indian deities, especially images of the Buddha, in a more indigenous style. The sculptures often had soft and graceful features, emphasizing spirituality and emotional depth.\nAmravati Art: The Amravati stupa in present-day Andhra Pradesh is associated with the Satavahana period and is known for its intricate relief sculptures. These sculptures depicted scenes from the life of the Buddha and Jataka tales. The art of Amravati is characterized by its intricate detailing and storytelling quality.\n\nCharacteristics of the different architectural schools are explained below with a suitable example from each.\n\n\u00a0SEATED BUDDHA, KATRA MOUNT, MATHURA\nA large number of images dating back to the Kushan period are from Mathura.\nThe image of Buddha from Karta Mount belongs to the second century CE.\nIt represents the Buddha with two Boddhisattva attendants.\nThe Buddha is seated in Padmasana and the right hand is in the Abhayamudra.\nThe face of the Buddha is round with fleshy cheeks.\nThe Ushanisha (hair knot) is shown with a vertical raised projection.\nMathura sculptures from this period are made with light volume having a fleshy body.\nThe sanghati (garment) covers only one shoulder.\nThe attendant figures are identified as the images of Padmapani and Vajrapani Bodhisattvas as one holds a lotus and the other a Vajra (Thunderbolt).\nThe halo around the head of Buddha is very large and is decorated with simple geometric motifs.\nThere are two flying figures placed diagonally above the halo.\nSEATED BUDDHA AT SARNATH, UP\nThe image of Buddha from Sarnath made of chunar sandstone belongs to the late fifth century CE.\nThe Buddha is shown seated on a throne in Padmasana.\nIt represents Dhammachakrapravartana (first sermon) as can be seen from the figures on the throne.\nThe panel below the throne depicts a Chakra (wheel) in the center and a deer on either side with his disciples.\nThus, it is the representation of the historic event of Dhammachakrapravartana or the preaching of dhamma.\nIt is the finest example of the Sarnath School of Sculpture.\nThe face is round, the eyes are half closed, the lower lip is protruding, and the roundness of the cheeks has reduced as compared to the earlier images from the Kushana period at Mathura.\nThe hands are shown in Dhammachakrapravartana Mudra.\nThe Ushanisha has circular curled hair.\nThe aim of the sculptures in ancient India had always been to represent the Buddha as a great human being who achieved Nibbana (cessation of anger and hate).\nBUDDHA HEAD, TAXILA, GANDHARA\nThe Buddha head from Taxila in the Gandhara region, now in Pakistan, dates back to the second century CE and belongs to the Kushanas period.\nIt shows the hybridized pictorial convention that developed during the Gandhara period.\nIt has Greek and Roman\u00a0elements.\nThe Buddha\u2019s Head has typical Hellenistic elements.\nThe curly hair of Buddha is thick having a covered layer of shape and linear strokes over the head.\nThe forehead plane is large having protruding eyeballs, the eyes are half closed and the face and cheeks are NOT round like the images of other parts of India.\nThere is a certain amount of heaviness in the figures of the Gandhara region.\nThe ears are elongated especially the ear lobes.\nThe treatment of the form bears linearity and the outlines are sharp.\nThe surface is smooth and the image is very expressive.\nThe expression of calmness is the center point of attraction.\nModeling of face enhances naturalism and three-dimensionality.\nAssimilating various traits of Acamenian, Parthian, and Bactrian traditions into the local tradition is a hallmark of the Gandhara style.\nThe source of the development of Buddha images as well as others has its genesis in its peculiar geopolitical conditions.\nIt may also be observed that the north-western part of India, which is now in Pakistan, always had continuous habitation from proto-historic times. It continued in the historic period as well.\nAMARAVATI STUPA, ANDHRA PRADESH\nVengi in Andhra Pradesh has many stupas like Jagayyapetta, Amaravati, Bahattiprolu, Nagarjunakonda, etc.\nAmaravati has a Maha chaitya and has many sculptures.\nLike the Sanchi stupa, the Amaravati stupa also has pradakshinapatha enclosed within a vedika on which many narrative sculptures are depicted.\nThe domical stupa structure is covered with relief stupa sculpture slab which is a unique feature.\nThe Torana of the Amaravati stupa has disappeared over some time.\nLike Sanchi, the early phase is devoid of Buddha images but during the later phase (2nd and 3rd CE); the Buddha images are carved on the drum slabs and at many other places.\nThe sculptural form in this area is characterized by intense emotions.\nBodies are shown with three bends (Tribanga), and the sculpture composition is more complex than Sanchi.\nThe Dream of Queen Mayadevi has also been depicted here.\nIndependent Buddha images are also found at Amaravati, Nagarjunakonda, and Guntapalle.\nGuntapalle is a rock-cut cave near Eluru, Andhra Pradesh.\nIn Karnataka, Sannati is the largest stupa excavated yet.\nAlong with the images of Buddha, other Buddhist images of Bodhisattvas like Avalokiteswara, Padmapani, Vajrapani, Amitabha, and Maitreya Buddha started getting sculpted.\nGandhara\n\t\nMathura\n\t\nAmaravati\n\n\nHellenistic art, Greeko-Roman elements along with traditional elements.\nBuddha is muscular.\nRich carving and great symbolism.\nHighly polished and rich carvings.\nCurly hair and elongated ears.\nFlowing type dress.\nInitially made of stone and later stucco was used.\n\t\nIndigenous in the beginning but later influenced by Gandhara.\nLess symbolism.\nNot much refined compared to Gandhara.\nHair is not always curly.\nMostly made of red sandstone.\n\t\nCompletely indigenous.\nMost of the works are on marble.\nBuddha is mostly represented by symbols.\nBeauty is less when compared to\u00a0Gandhara and Mathura.\nPost Mauryan Trends: Caves in Western India\n\nIn western India, many Buddhist caves dating back to the second century BCE onwards have been excavated.\n\nThree architectural types were executed:\n\nApsidal vault-roof chaitya hall (found at Ajanta, Pitalkhora, Bhaja)\nApsidal vault-roof pillar-less hall (found at Thana-Nadsur)\nFlat roofed quadrangular hall with a circular chamber at the back (found at Kondivite)\nIn all the chaitya caves, a stupa at the back is common.\nIn the first century BCE, some modifications were made to the standard plan of the apsidal vault-roof variety where the hall became rectangular with a stone screen wall as a facade.\nThe biggest rock cur chaitya hall was excavated in Karla, Maharashtra.\nViharas are excavated in all the caves.\nThe plan of the vihara consists of a veranda, a hall, and cells around the walls of the hall.\nMany of the early vihara caves are carved with interior decorative motifs like chaitya arches and vedika designs over the cell doors of the cave.\nA stupa was added in the back of the vihara in the later period and it became Chaitya- Vihara.\nJunnar (Maharashtra) has the largest cave excavations \u2013 more than 200 caves around the hills of the town \u2013 whereas Kanheri in Mumbai has a hundred and eight excavated caves.\nVihara cave excavated at Junnar is popularly known as Ganeshi because of an image of Ganesh belonging to a later period was installed in it.\nEarlier it was believed that because of the absence of the Buddha images, the caves were considered to belong to the orthodox faith of Buddhism, Theravadins.\nBut with the discovery of the Konkan Maurya inscription mentioning the Saka era 322 (400CE), it is now satisfactorily proved that the cave activity in western Deccan was an ongoing process and many caves had been carved with Buddha image where the image does not exist anymore.\nIt may also be noted that many caves are converted into modern Hindu shrines and have become popular worship sites.\nAjanta\nThe famous cave site in western India is Ajanta.\nIt is located in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra.\nIt has 29 caves, including 4 chaitya caves.\nIt has a large Chaitya-Vihara and is decorated with sculptures and paintings (murals).\nAjanta is the only surviving example of the painting of the first century BCE and the fifth century BCE.\nSome of the Vihara caves here are unfinished.\nThe important patrons of Ajanta were Varahadeva, the Prime Minister of Vakataka king Harisena; Upendragupta, the local king of the region and feudatory of Harisena; Buddhabadra and Mathurasena.\nMajor paintings are in caves Nos. 1, 2, 16, and 17.\nThe paintings have a lot of typological variations.\nFigures in the paintings are heavy like the sculptures of western India.\nCave excavation and painting were a simultaneous process and the dating of the paintings follows the date of the cave excavation.\nAlmost in all the finished excavations, pictures have been painted, but very few have survived.\nVarious skin colors in the paintings represent a multi-colored society.\nThe themes of the paintings are events from the life of Buddha, the Jatakas, and Avadanas.\nEvents that happened in the jungle and events that happened in the palace are separated by their locations.\nImages of Padmapani and Vajrapani are very common in Ajanta.\nPADMAPANI BODHISATTVA\nIt is a painting which dates back to the late first century CE.\nThe Bodhisattva is holding a Padma (Lotus) has large shoulders and has three bents in the body creating a movement in the picture space.\nThe modeling is soft and the outlines are merged with the body volume, creating the effects of three-dimensionality.\nLight red, brown, green, and blue colors are used in the picture.\nOn the other side of the image, Vajrapani Bodhisattva has been painted.\nHe holds a vajra in his right hand and wears a crown.\nBodhisattvas are painted as shrine guardians\nSimilar pictures can be seen in other caves too. However, pictures in Cave No. 1 are among the best surviving paintings of Ajanta.\nMARA VIJAYA, AJANTA CAVE NO. 26\nThe theme of Mara Vijaya has been painted in the caves of Ajanta, but only cave no.26 has a sculptural representation, sculpted on the right wall.\nThe panel shows the image of the Buddha in the center, surrounded by Mara\u2019s army.\nThe event is the part of enlightenment and Mara represents desire.\nIt is the personification of mind that the Buddha went through at the time of enlightenment.\nThe Buddha is shown with his right hand indicating towards the earth as a witness to his generosity.\nThe image of Mara is shown contemplating how to disturb Siddhartha, the name of Buddha before enlightenment.\nEllora\nAnother important cave site located in Aurangabad is Ellora.\nIt is located 100 km away from Ajanta.\nThere are 32 Buddhist, Brahamanical, and Jain caves.\nIt is a unique art historic site in the country as it has monasteries associated with the three religions dating from the fifth century CE onwards to the eleventh century CE.\nIt is also unique in terms of stylistic eclecticism, i.e., the confluence of many styles in one place.\n12 Buddhist caves have many images belonging to Vajrayana Buddhism.\nBuddhist caves are big and are single, double, and triple-story.\nThe triple story of Ellora is a unique one.\nPillar designs grow from Buddhist caves and when they reach Jain caves (9th century CE), they become very ornate and the decorative forms gain heavy protrusion.\nMost of the caves of the Brahamanical faith are dedicated to Shaivism.\nThe different avatars of Vishnu are also depicted here.\nCave no.16 is known as Kailas Leni/Kailasa temple.\nIt is a rock-cut temple that is carved out of a single rock.\nIt was built in the 8th century CE.\nThe grand sculpture of Ravana attempting to lift Mount Kailash, with his full might is a landmark in Indian art.\nElephanta caves and other sites\nElephanta caves located on Elephanta Island near Mumbai were originally a Buddhist site which was later dominated by the Shaivite faith.\nIt is contemporary with Ellora.\nThe other noteworthy cave site is Bagh located near Indore, MP.\nThe Bagh cave also contains paintings and a painting that represents a group of dancers that resembles the Garba Dance of North India (originated in Gujarat).\nThe tradition of rock-cut caves continued in the Deccan and they are found not only in Maharashtra but also in Karnataka, mainly at Badami and Aihole, executed under the patronage of the Chalukyas; in Andhra Pradesh in the area of Vijayawada; and Tamil Nadu, mainly at Mahabalipuram, under the patronage of the Pallavas.\nWhen the early history of the country depended on collective public patronage, the post-sixth century CE depended more on political patronage.\nThe sculpture of Maheshmurti (Shiva at the center and heads of Bhairava and Uma on either side) is located here.\nPost Mauryan Trends: Caves in Eastern India\n\nLike in western India, Buddhist caves have been excavated in eastern India, mainly in the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.\n\nOne of the main sites in Andhra Pradesh is Guntapalle in Eluru district.\nGuntapalle is among the unique sites where the structural stupas, viharas, and caves are excavated in one place.\nApart from Guntapalle, the other important site is Rampaerrampallam.\nIn Ankapalli, near Vishakapattanam, a huge rock-cut stupa was carved out of the hillock during the 4th-5th century CE.\nIt is a unique site as it has the biggest rock-cut stupas in the country.\nAnother important cave site is the Udayagiri-Khandagiri caves located in Odisha.\nThese caves are scattered and have inscriptions of Kaharvela Kings.\nAccording to the inscription, the caves were meant for Jain monks.\nThere are numerous single-cell excavations here.\nThe upper part of the cell is decorated with a series of Chaitya arches and narratives that continue in the folklore of the region.\nPost Mauryan Trends in Architecture: Early Temples\n\nWhile the construction of stupas continued, Brahmanical temples and images of gods also started being constructed. Myths mentioned in the Puranas became part of narrative representation. Each temple had a principal image of god.\n\nThe shrines of the temple were of three kinds:\n\nSandhara type: with pradakshinapatha.\nNirandara type: without pradakshinapatha.\nSarvatobhadra type: which can accessed from all sides.\n\nSome of the important temple sites of this period are Deogarh (UP), Eran, Nacha-kuthara, and Udayagiri near Vidisha in MP, etc.\n\nThese temples are simple structures consisting of a veranda, a hall, and a shrine at the rear.\n\nArticle compiled by: Jijo Sudarsan"

        "[CONTENT]": "In this article titled \u2018Later Mural Traditions\u2019, we discuss about the mural traditions developed in India after the initial mural traditions of\u00a0Ajanta, Ellora, and other such sites.\u00a0 This article is a part of the Indian Culture\u00a0series based on the NCERT text book \u2018An Introduction to Indian Art\u2019 \u2013 Part 1.\n\nWe have already discussed in detail about the Prehistoric Era Art and the early\u00a0Rock Paintings in our previous posts. The article \u2018Later Mural Traditions\u2019 is a continuation of the previous posts like Arts of the Mauryan Period\u00a0and\u00a0Post Mauryan Trends in Indian Art and Architecture.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLater Mural Traditions\nBadami:\nMurals under Pallava, Pandava and Chola kings:\nVijayanagara:\nKerala Mural:\nSome of the other traditional Murals are:\nLater Mural Traditions\nEven after Ajanta, very few sites with paintings have survived which provide valuable evidences to reconstruct the tradition of painting.\nThe sculptures too were plastered and painted and the tradition of cave excavation continued further in many places where sculpting and painting were done simultaneously.\nBadami:\nOne of the examples of later Mural tradition is Badami, Karnataka.\nIt was the capital of the western Chalukyan dynasty, which ruled the region from 543 to 598 CE.\nWith the decline of the Vakataka rule, the Chalukyas established their power in the Deccan.\nThe Chalukya king, Mangalesha, patronized the excavations of Badami caves. He was the younger son of the Chalukya king, Pulikeshi I, and the brother of Kirtivarman-I.\n\nThe cave No. 4 is popularly known as Vishnu cave and in the inscriptions patron (Mangalesha) records his Vaishnava affiliation.\nOne of the paintings shows Kirtivarman, the son of Pulikeshi I and the elder brother Mangalesha, seated inside the palace with his wife and feudatories watching a dance scene.\nStylistically the painting represents an extension of the tradition of mural paintings from Ajanta to Badami in south India.\nThe sinuously drawn lines, fluid forms and compact composition exemplify the proficiency and maturity the artist had achieved in the 6th century CE.\nThe gracefully drawn faces remind us of the style of modelling in Ajanta.\nTheir eye sockets are large, eyes are half closed, and the lips are protruding.\nMurals under Pallava, Pandava and Chola kings:\nThe tradition of painting extended further down south in Tamil Nadu in the preceding centuries with regional variations during the regime of Pallava, Pandya and Chola dynasties.\nThe Pallava kings, who succeeded the Chalukyas in parts of the south India, were also patrons of the arts.\nMahendravarman (Pallava) who ruled the 7th century CE was responsible for building temples at Panamalai, Mandagapattu, and Kanchipuram.\nThe inscriptions at Mandagapattu mentions Mahendravarman I with numerous titles such as Vichitrachitta (curious minded), Chitrakarapuli (tiger among artists), Chaityakari (temple builder), which shows his interests in art activities.\nPaintings in Kanchipuram temple were patronized by the Pallava king, Rajasimha.\nIncreased ornamentation was a notable feature of these paintings when compared with the paintings of the earlier period.\nWhen the Pandyas rose to power, they too patronized art.\nTirumalaipuram caves and Jaina caves at Sittanvasal are some of the surviving examples.\nThe tradition of building temples and embellishing them with carvings and paintings continued during the reign of the Chola kings who ruled over the region from 9th to the 13th\nBut it was in the 11th century, when the Cholas reached their zenith of power, the masterpieces of Chola art and architecture began to appear.\nThe temples of Brihadeswara at Tanjore, Gangaikonda Cholapuram and Darasuram were built during the reign of Rajaraja Chola and Rajendra Chola.\nThe important paintings of Chola period can be seen at Nartamalai and Brihadeswara temples.\nIn Brihadeswara temple, the paintings were executed on the walls of the narrow passage surrounding the shrine.\nTwo layers of paints were found when they were discovered.\nThe upper/outer layer was painted during the Nayaka period, in the 16th century.\u00a0\n\nThe Chola paintings at Brihadeswara are showing the aspects related to the Lord Shiva, Shiva in Kailash, Shiva as Tripuranartaka, Shiva as Nataraja, a portrait of Rajaraja and his mentor Kuruvar, dancing figures, etc.\nVijayanagara:\n\nWith the decline of the Chola dynasty in the 13th century, the Vijayanagara dynasty captured and brought under its control the reign from Hampi to Trichy with Hampi serving as its capital.\n\nThe paintings at Tiruparakunram, near Trichy, done in the 14th century represent the early phase of the Vijayanagara style.\nIn Hampi (Karnataka), the Virupaksha temple has paintings on the ceiling of its mandapa narrating vents from dynastic history and episodes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata.\nAmong the important panels are the one which shows Vidyaranya, the spiritual teacher of Bukkaraya Harsha.\nIn Lepakshi, near Hindupur, in present Andhra Pradesh, there are glorious examples of Vijayanagara paintings on the walls of the Shiva temple.\nThe stylistic conventions of the proceeding centuries were adopted by artists in various centres in south India as can be seen in the paintings of the Nayaka period.\nNayaka paintings in the 17th and 18th centuries are seen in Thiruparakuram, Sreerangam, and Tiruvarur (all in Tamil Nadu).\nIn Tiruparakunram, paintings are found of two different periods \u2013 of the 14th and 17th Earlier paintings depict scenes from the life of Vardhamana Mahavira.\nThe Nayaka paintings depict episodes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana and also scenes from Krishna Leela.\nIn Tiruvarur, there is a panel narrating the story of Machukunda.\nIn the Srikrishna temple at Ehengam in Arcot District there are 26 panels narrating the story of the Ramayana, which represents the late phase of the Nayaka paintings.\nFrom the examples, it suggests that Nayaka paintings were more or less an extension of Vijayanagara style with minor regional modifications and incorporations.\nThe figures are mostly set against a flat background and the male figures are shown with slim waist but with less heavy abdomen as compared to those in Vijayanagara.\nKerala Mural:\nKerala painters (16th to 18th century) evolved a pictorial language and technology of their own while discriminately adopting certain stylistic elements from Nayaka and Vijayanagara schools.\nThe painters evolved a language taking cues from contemporary traditions like Kathakali and Kalam Ezhuthtu using vibrant and luminous colours, representing human figures in three dimensions.\nMost of the paintings are seen on the shrine walls, cloister walls of temples and some inside the palaces.\nThematically too, paintings from Kerala stand apart.\nMost of the narrations are based on those episodes from Hindu mythology which were popular in Kerala.\nThe artist seems to have derived sources from oral traditions and local versions of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata for painting narrations.\nMore than 60 sites have been found with mural paintings.\nThe important palaces where mural paintings can be found are : Dutch Palace, Kochi, Krishna Puram palace, Kayamkulam and Padmanabhapuram palace.\nThe mature phase of Kerala\u2019s mural tradition can be seen at Pundareekapuram Krishna Temple, Panayanarkavu, Thirukodithanam, Tripayar Sri Rama temple and Thrissur Vadakkunnatha temple.\nSome of the other traditional Murals are:\nPithora \u2013 Rajasthan and Gujarat.\nMaithili \u2013 Bihar\nWarli \u2013 Maharashtra\n\nCompiled by Jijo Sudarshan"

It was a gradual evolution starting from the rock cut- cave temples to monolithic rathas which finally culminated in structural temples.The basic form of a Hindu structural temple consists of the following.\n\n\u00a0 1. Garbhagriha:\nIt literally means \u2018womb-house\u2019 and is a cave like sanctum.\nIn the earliest temples, it was a small cubical structure with a single entrance.\nLater it grew into a larger complex.\nThe Garbhagriha is made to house the main icon (main deity) which is itself the focus of much ritual attention.\n\u00a0 2. Mandapa:\nIt is the entrance to the temple.\nIt may be a portico or colonnaded (series of columns placed at regular intervals) hall that incorporates space for a large number of worshippers.\nDances and such other entertainments are practiced here.\nSome temples have multiple mandapas in different sizes named as Ardhamandapa, Mandapa, and Mahamandapa.\n\u00a0 3. Shikhara or Vimana:\nThey are mountain like the spire of a free-standing temple.\nShikhara is found in North Indian temples and Vimana is found in South Indian temples.\nShikhara has a curving shape while vimana has a pyramidal-like structure.\n\n\u00a04. Amalaka:\nIt is a stone disc like structure at the top of the temple and they are common in North Indian temples.\n\u00a05. Kalasha:\nIt is the topmost point of the temple and commonly seen in North Indian temples.\n\u00a06. Antarala (vestibule):\nAntarala is a transition area between the Garbhagriha and the temple\u2019s main hall (mandapa).\n\u00a07. Jagati:\nIt is a raised platform for sitting and praying and is common in North Indian temples.\n\u00a0 8. Vahana:\nIt is the mount or vehicle of the temple\u2019s main deity along with a standard pillar or Dhvaj which is placed axially before the sanctum.\nClassification of Indian Temples\n\nIndian temples can be classified into two broad orders as\n\nNagara (in North India)\nDravida (in South India)\nAt times, the Vesara style of temples as an independent style created through the mixing of Nagara and Dravida orders.\n\nAlso read: Famous Temples in India\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nSculptures, Iconography, and Ornamentation\nIconography is a branch of art history which studies the images of deities.\nIt consists of identification of image based on certain symbols and mythology associated with them.\nEven though the fundamental myth and meaning of the deity may remain the same for centuries, its specific usage at a spot can be a response to its local or immediate social, political or geographical context.\nEvery region and period produce its own distinct style of images with its regional variations in iconography.\nThe temple is covered with elaborate sculptures and ornament that form a fundamental part of its conception.\nThe placement of an image in a temple is carefully planned: for instance, river goddesses (Ganga and Yamuna) are visually found at the entrances in a Nagara temple, Dwarapalas are usually found on the gateway or gopurams of Dravida temples, similarly mithunas (erotic images), navagrahas ( the 9 auspicious planets) and Yakshas are also placed at the entrances to guard them.\nVarious forms or aspects of the main divinity are to be found on the outer walls of the sanctum.\nThe ashtadikpalas (deities of direction) face eight key directions on the outer walls of the sanctum and/or on the outer walls of the temple.\nSubsidiary shrines around the main temple are dedicated to the family or incarnations of the main deity.\nThe various elements of ornamentation are gavaksha, vyala/ yali, kalpa-lata, amalaka, kalasha, etc.\nThe Nagara or North Indian Temple Architecture\nNagara is the style of temple architecture which became popular in Northern India.\nIt is common here to build an entire temple on a stone platform with steps leading up to it.\nUnlike in south India, it doesn\u2019t usually have elaborate boundary walls or gateways.\nEarliest temples had only one shikhara (tower), but in the later periods, multiple shikharas came.\nThe garbhagriha is always located directly under the tallest tower.\n\nNagara temples can be subdivided mainly into three \u2013 based on the shikhara type.\n\n\u00a0 1. Latina/ Rekha-Prasada:\nIt is the simple and most common type of shikhara.\nIt is square at the base and the walls curve or slopes inwards to a point on top.\nLatina types are mainly used for housing the garbhagriha.\nLater on, the Latina buildings grew complex, and instead of appearing like a single tower, the temple began to support many small towers, which were clustered together like rising mountain type with the tallest one being in the centre, and this was the one which was always above the garbhagriha.\n\u00a0 2. Phamsana type shikhara:\nThey are broader and shorter than Latina type.\nTheir roof is composed of several slabs that gently rise to a single point over the centre of the building, unlike the Latina ones which look like sharply rising towers.\nPhamsana roofs do not curve inwards; instead, they slope upward on a straight incline.\nIn many north Indian temples, the phamsana type is used for mandapas while the main garbhagriha is housed in a Latina building.\n\u00a0 3. Valabhi type shikhara:\nThese are rectangular buildings with a roof that rises into a vaulted chamber.\nThe edge of the vaulted chamber is round, like the bamboo or wooden wagons that would have been drawn by bullocks in ancient times.\nThe form of this temple is influenced by ancient building forms that were already in existence.\n\nWe can also classify the Nagara Temples on the basis of region as follows:\n\nCentral India\nIn the later periods, the temples grew from simple four pillared structures to a large complex.\nThis means that similar developments were incorporated in the architecture of temples of both the religions.\nTwo such temples that survive are; temple at Udaygiri which is on the outskirts of Vidisha (it is a part of a large Hindu temple complex) and a temple at Sanchi, which was a Buddhist site.\nThe early temples were modest looking shrines each have four pillars that support a small mandapa before an equally small room that served as garbhagriha.\nSome of the oldest surviving structural temples of Gupta period are in Madhya Pradesh.\nThe ancient temple sin UP, MP and Rajasthan share many traits and the most visible is that they are made of Sandstone.\n\u00a0 1. DASHAVATARA VISHNU TEMPLE, DEOGARH, UP:\nEven though the patrons and donors of the temple are unknown, it is believed that this temple was built in the early 6th century CE.\nThis is a classical example of the late Gupta period.\nThis temple is in the Panchayatana style of architecture. [Panchayatana is an architectural style where the main shrine is built on a rectangular plinth with four smaller subsidiary shrines at the four corners and making it a total of five shrines \u2013 i.e., Pancha]\nThere are 3 main reliefs of Vishnu on the temple walls.\nIn fact, it is not actually known to whom the four subsidiary shrines were originally dedicated.\nThe temple depicts Vishnu in various forms due to which it was assumed that the four subsidiary shrines must also house Vishnu\u2019s avatars and the temple was mistaken for a dashavatara temple.\nThe grand doorway of the west facing temple (west facing is less common) has the sculptures of Ganga on the left and Yamuna on the right side.\nThe shikhara is in latina/ prasada style which makes it clear that this is an early example of a classical nagara style of the temple.\nSheshayana \u2013 on the south (Vishnu reclining on the sheshanaga called Ananta)\nNara-Narayana \u2013 on the east (discussion between human soul and the eternal divine)\nGajendramoksha \u2013 on the west (story of achieving moksha , symbolically communicated by Vishnu\u2019s suppression o an asura who had taken the form of an elephant)\nThe temple is west facing, which is less common, as most of the temples are east or north facing.\n\u00a0 2. TEMPLES AT KHAJURAHO, MADHYA PRADESH:\nThe temples at Khajuraho were made in the 10th century, about 400 years after the temple at Deogarh and the complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe temples were patronized by Chandela kings.\nWe can see how dramatically the shape and style of the nagara temple architecture had developed.\nThe temples at Khajuraho are all made of Sandstone.\nThe largest temple at Khajuraho is the Kandariya Mahadeva temple which is attributed to king Ganda.\nThe Lakshmana temple dedicated to Vishnu was built in 954 by Chandela king, Dhanga.\nAll the towers or shikhara of the temple rise high, upward in a curved pyramidal fashion, emphasizing the temple\u2019s vertical thrust ending in a horizontal fluted disc called an Amalaka topped with a Kalasha or a vase.\nThe crowning element Kalasha and Amalaka are to be found on all nagara temples of this period.\nThe Khajuraho temples are also known for their extensive erotic sculptures (about 10% of total sculptures); the erotic expression gives equal importance in human experience as a spiritual pursuit, and it is seen as a part of the larger cosmic whole.\nMany Hindu temples, therefore feature Mithuns (embracing couples-erotic sculptures) sculptures, considered auspicious.\nKhajuraho sculptures are highly stylized with typical features.\nThere are many temples at Khajuraho, most of them dedicated to Hindu gods.\nThere are some Jain temples as well as a Chausanth Yogini temple.\nChausanth Yogini is a temple of small square shrines dedicated to esoteric devis or goddesses associated with the rise of Tantric worship after the 7th\n[Khajuraho dance festival is organized by MP Kalaparishad and is one week long (first week of February) festival of classical dances celebrated annually against the spectacular backdrop of Khajuraho]\nWest India\nThere are too numerous temples in the northwestern parts of India, including Gujarat and Rajasthan, and stylistically extendable, at times, to western Madhya Pradesh.\nThe stones to build temples ranges in colour and type.\nWhile sandstone is the commonest, a grey to black basalt can be seen in some of the 10th to 12th-century temple sculptures.\nThe most exuberant and famed are the manipulatable soft white marble which is also seen in some of the 10th to 12th-century Jain temples in Mount Abu and the 15th-century temple at Ranatpur.\nAmong the most important art, historical sites in the region are Samlaji in Gujarat.\nIt shows how earlier artistic traditions of the region mixed with a post-Gupta style and gave rise to a distinct style of sculpture.\nA large number of sculptures made of grey schist have been found in this region.\n\u00a0 1. SUN TEMPLE, MODHERA, GUJARAT:\nThe temple dates back to the early 11th century and was built by Raja Bhimdev I of the Solanki dynasty.\nThe Solanks were a branch off later Chalukyas.\nThere is a massive rectangular stepped tank called Surya Kund in front of it.\nThe hundred square metre rectangular pond is perhaps the grandest temple tank in India.\nA hundred and eight miniature shrines are carved in between the steps inside the tank.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA huge ornamental arch-torana leads one to the sabha mandapa (the assembly hall) which is open on all sides, as was the fashion of the times in western and central India temples.\nEast India\nEast Indian temples include those found in the North-East, Bengal, and Odisha and each of these three areas produces a distinct type of temple.\nThe history of architecture in the northeast and Bengal is hard to study because a number of ancient buildings in those regions were renovated, and what survives now is later brick or concrete temples at those sites.\nIt appears that terracotta was the main medium of construction.\nA large number of sculptures have been found in Assam and Bengal, which shows the development of important regional schools in those regions.\nASSAM:\nAn old 6th century sculpted door frame from DaParvatia near Tezpur and another few stray sculptures from Rangagora Tea Estate near Tinsukia in Assam bear witness to the import of the Gupta idiom in that region.\nThe post-Gupta style continued in the region well in the 10th\nHowever, by the 12th to 14th centuries, a distinct regional style developed in Assam.\nThe style that came with the migration of the Tais from upper Burma mixed with the dominant Pala style of Bengal and led to the creation of what was later known as the Ahom style in and around Guwahati.\nKamakhya temple, a Shakti peeth, is dedicated to goddess Kamakhya and was built in the 17th century.\nBENGAL:\nThe style of sculptures during the period between the 9th and 11th centuries in Bengal (including Bangladesh) and Bihar is known as the Pala style, named after the ruling dynasty at that time.\nThat style in the mid 11th and mid 13th centuries is named after the Sena kings.\nWhile the Palas are celebrated as patrons of Buddhist monastic sites, the temple of the region is known to express the Vanga style.\nThe Siddheswara Mahadeva temple in Burdwan, W.B, built in the 9th century, shows a tall curving shikhara crowned by a large amalaka, is an example of early Pala style.\nMany of the temples from 9th to 12th centuries were located at Telkupi in Puruta district, W.B.\nThey were submerged when dams were constructed in the region.\nThe architecture of these temples heavily influenced the earliest Bengal Sultanate buildings at Gaur and Pandya.\nMany local vernacular building traditions of Bengal also influenced the style of the temple in that region.\nThe most prominent of these was the shape of the sloping or curving side of the bamboo roof of a Bengali hut.\nThis feature was eventually even adopted in Mughal buildings and is known as across India as the Bangla Roof (word Bungalow derived from this).\nODISHA (KALINGIA ARCHITECTURE):\n\nThe main architectural features of Odisha temples are classified in three orders:\n\nA. REKHAPIDA/ REKHA DEULA/ RATHAKA DEULA:\n\nRekha means line and it is a tall straight building with a shape of a sugar loaf. It covers the garbhagriha.\n\nB. PIDHADEULA:\n\nIt is a square building with a pyramid shaped roof and is mainly found for housing the outer dancing and offering halls.\n\nC. KHAKRADEULA:\n\nIt is a rectangular building with a truncated pyramid shaped roof. Temples of the female deities are usually in this form (garbhagriha usually) and will have a resemblance with Dravidian temples of the south.\n\nMost of the ancient temples are located in ancient Kalinga \u2013 modern Puri district, including Bhuvaneswar or ancient Tribhuvaneswar, Puri, and Konark.\nThe temples of Odisha constitute a distinct sub-style within nagara order.\nIn general, here the Shikhara called Deul in Odisha is vertical almost until the top when it suddenly curves sharply inwards.\nMandapas in Odisha are called Jagamohanas.\nThe ground plan of the main temple is almost always square, which, in the upper reaches of its superstructure becomes circular in the crowning\nThe exterior of the temple is lavishly curved while their interiors are generally quite bare.\nOdisha temples usually have outer walls.\n\n\u00a0 1. Sun temple, Konark, Odisha:\n\nIt is built around 1240 on the shores of the Bay of Bengal.\nThe temple is set on a high base, its walls covered in extensive, detailed ornamental carving.\nThese include 12 pairs of enormous wheels sculpted with spokes and hubs, representing the chariot wheels of the sun God who, in mythology, rides a chariot driven by 8 horses, sculpted here at the entrance staircase.\nThe whole temple thus comes to resemble a colossal processional chariot.\nOn the southern wall is a massive sculpture of Surya carved out of green stones.\nIt is said that there were 3 such images, carved out of a different stone placed on the three temple walls, each facing different directions.\nThe fourth wall had the doorway into the temple from where the actual rays of the sun would enter the garbhagriha.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. Jagannatha temple, Puri, Odisha:\n\nIt is also located on the eastern coast, at Puri, Odisha.\nThe temple is a part of Char Dham (Badrinath, Dwaraka, Puri, Rameswaram) pilgrimages that a Hindu is expected to make in one\u2019s lifetime.\nWhen most of the deities in the temples of India are made of stone or metal, the idol of Jagannatha is made of wood which is ceremoniously replaced in every twelve or nineteen years by using sacred trees.\nThe temple is believed to be constructed in the 12th century by King Anatavarman Chodaganga Deva of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty.\nThe temple is famous for its annual Ratha Yatra or Chariot festival.\nThe Hills\nA unique form of architecture developed in the hills of Kumaon, Garhwal, Himachal and Kashmir.\nKashmir\u2019s proximity to Gandhara site (such as Taxila, Peshawar and northwest frontier) left the region a strong Gandhara influence by the 5th century CE.\nThis began to mix with the Gupta and post-Gupta traditions that brought to it from Sarnath, Mathura, and even centres in Gujarat and Bengal.\nBoth Buddhist and Hindu traditions began to intermingle and spread in the hills.\nThe hills also had their own tradition of wooden building with pitched roofs and as a result, while the main garbhagriha and shikhara are made in latina/rekha-prasada type, the mandapa is an older form of wooden architecture.\nSometimes, the temple itself takes on a pagoda shape.\nThe Karkota period of Kashmir is the most significant in terms of architecture.\nThe most important temples of these regions are Pandrethan, Laksna-devi Mandir, Jageswar near Almora, Chambavat near Pithoragarh, etc.\nThe Dravida or South Indian Temple Architecture\nUnlike the nagara temple, the Dravida temple is enclosed within a compound wall.\nThe front wall has an entrance gateway in its centre, which is known as Gopura/ Gopuram.\nThe shape of the main temple tower is known as Vimana (shikhara in nagara style).\nThe vimana is like a stepped pyramid that rises up geometrically rather than the curving shikhara of north India.\nIn south India, the word Shikhara is used only for the crowning element at the top of the temple which is usually shaped like a small stupika or an octagonal cupola (this is equivalent to the amalaka or kalasha of north Indian temples).\n\nIn north Indian temples, we can see images such as Mithunas (erotic) and the river goddesses, Ganga and Yamuna guarding the temple. But in the Dravida style of temple architecture, instead of these sculptures, we can see the sculptures of fierce dvarapalas or door keepers guarding the temple.\nA large water reservoir or a temple tank enclosed in the complex is general in south Indian temples.\nSubsidiary shrines are either incorporated within the main temple tower or located as a distinct, separate small shrine beside the main temple.\nThe north Indian idea of multiple shikharas rising together as a cluster was not popular in Dravida style.\nAt some of the most sacred temples in south India, the main temple in which the garbhagriha is situated has, in fact, one of the smallest towers.\nThis is because it is usually the oldest part of the temple.\nWhen the population and the size of the town associated with the temple increased, it would have become necessary to make a new boundary wall around the temple (and also associated structures).\nAn example for this is the Srirangam temple at Thiruchirapally, which has as many as seven concentric rectangular enclosure walls, each with gopurams.\nThe outermost is the oldest while the tower right in the centre housing the garbhagriha is the oldest.\nJust as the nagara architecture has subdivisions, dravida temples also have subdivisions. These are basically of five different shapes:\nKuta or caturasra \u2013 square\nShala or ayatasra \u2013 rectangular\nGaja-prishta or vrittayata (elephant backed) \u2013elliptic\nVritta \u2013 circular\nAshtasra \u2013 octagonal\nPallavas:\nThe Pallavas were one of the ancient south Indian dynasties that were active in Andhra region from the 2nd century onwards and moved south to settle in Tamil Nadu.\nTheir history is better documented in the inscriptions in stone and several monuments.\nAlthough they were mostly Shaivites, several Vaishnava shrines also survived from the reign, and there is no doubt that they were influenced by the long Buddhist history of the Deccan.\nThe early buildings of Pallavas were rock-cut; while the later ones were structural (structural buildings were well known to them when rock cut ones being excavated).\nThe early buildings are generally attributed to Mahendravarman I, contemporary of Chalukya king, Pulikeshi II of Karnataka.\nNarasimhavarman I, who was also known as Mamalla, acceded the throne around 640 CE.\nHe expanded the empire and also inaugurated most of the building work at Mahabalipuram which is known after him as Mamallapuram.\n\u00a0 The shore temple at Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu\nIt is a structural temple and was built during the reign of Narasimhavarman II, also known as Rajasimha.\nThe temple is facing east towards the sea and has three shrines \u2013 east and west to Shiva and the middle for Vishnu (Anantashayana).\nThis is unusual because temples generally have a single main shrine and not three areas of worship. This shows that it was probably not originally conceived like this and different shrine may be added at different times.\nIn the compound, there is an evidence of a water tank, an early example of a gopuram, and several other images.\nSculpture of the bull, Nandi, Shiva\u2019s mount, lines the temple walls.\nThe temple has suffered severe disfiguration due to erosion by salt water laden air over the centuries.\n\nThe Pallava temple architecture can be classified into four groups according to the rulers and the features of temples they constructed.\n\na. Mahendravarman Group:\n\nEarly temples of the Pallavas belong to King Mahendravarman I (7th century).\nThey were rock-cut temples (may be influenced by rock-cut architecture).\ng. Manndagapattu, Mahendravadi, Tircuchirapally, etc.\n\nb. Narasimha/Mamalla Group:\n\nIt is the second stage of Pallava architecture which started when Narasimhavarman I (Mamalla) came to the throne.\nThe architecture is represented by Monolithic rocks.\nThe monolithic rathas and mandapas of Mamallapuram are examples.\nThe five rathas are popularly known as Panchapandava rathas.\n\nc. Rajasimha Group:\n\nThe group was under Narasimhavarman II who was also known as Rajasimha.\nHe introduced the structural temples and Gopura style in Pallava architecture.\nThe Kailasnath temple at Kanchi and the Shore temple at Mahabalipuram are examples.\n\nd. Nandivaram Group:\n\nArchitecture mainly under the Pallava king, Nandivaram Pallava.\nThey also represented structural temples.\nThe temples were generally small compared to the other groups.\nThe Vaikundaperumal temple, Tirunelveli and Mukteswara temple are examples.\nCholas\nThe best example of Chola temple architecture is the Brihadeswara temple at Tanjore.\nThe temple is also known as Rajarajeswara temple.\nIt was completed around 1009 by Rajaraja Chola and is the largest and tallest of all Indian temples.\nThe temples pyramidal multi-storeyed Vimana rises a massive seventy metres, topped by a monolithic shikhara, and the kalasha on top by itself is about three metres and eight centimetres in height.\nThe main deity of the temple is Shiva, who is shown as a huge lingam set in a two storeyed sanctum.\nPainted Murals and sculptures decorate the walls surrounding the sanctum.\nThe Vesara or the Deccan Temple Architecture\nThe buildings in the Deccan region are hybridized style, which contains both elements from nagara and Dravida architectural styles and is known in some ancient texts as the Vesara style (not all temples of Deccan are the vesara type).\nThe vesara style became popular after the mid 7th century.\nChalukyas\n\n\u00a0 1. Ravan Phadi cave, Aihole, Karnataka:\n\nThe Ravan Phadi cave at Aihole is an example of the early Chalukya style which is known for its distinct sculptural style.\nOne of the most important sculptures at the site is of Nataraja, surrounded by a large depiction of saptamatrikas: three to Shiva\u2019s left and four to his right.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 2. Lad Khan Temple at Aihole, Karnataka:\n\nThe temple is dedicated to Shiva and is one of the oldest Hindu temples.\nBuilt in the 5th century by the Kings of the Chalukya Dynasty.\nIt seems to be inspired by the wooden \u2013 roofed temples of the hills except that it is constructed out of stone.\nThe temple is named after a person named Lad Khan, who turned this temple into his residence for a short period.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 3. Durga Temple at Aihole, Karnataka:\n\nThe temple is built in between 7th and 8th\u00a0century.\nThe architecture of the temple is predominantly Dravida with Nagara style also in certain areas.\nThe temple is considered as a unique and magnificent temple of the Chalukya period.\nThe Lad Khan Temple of Aihole is located to its South.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 4. Temples at Pattadakkal, Karnataka:\n\nThere are ten temples at Pattadakkal including a Jain temple and is a UNESCO world Heritage Site.\nA fusion of various architectural styles can be seen here.\nOut of ten temples, four are in Dravida style, four are in nagara style and one is a Jain temple, while the Papanatha Temple is built in a fusion of both nagara and Dravida styles.\nThe Jain temple (Jain Narayana temple) was built by Rashtrakutas in the 9th\nThe Virupaksha temple at Pattadakkal is also known as Sri-Lokeswar-Maha-Sila-Prasad, was built by Loka Mahadevi, the Queen of the Chalukya king Vikramaditya II (733-44).\nIt was probably built around 740 CE to commemorate her husband\u2019s victory over the Pallavas of Kanchipuram.\nIt closely resembles the Kailasnath temple at Kanchipuram on plan and elevation.\nIt represents a fully developed and perfect stage of the Dravida architecture.\nRashtrakutas\nBy about 750 CE, the early western Chalukya control of the Deccan was taken by the Rashtrakutas.\nTheir greatest achievement in architecture is the Kailasnath Temple at Ellora.\nThe Jain temple at Pattadakkal was also built by Rashtrakutas.\nHoyasalas\nWith the waning Chola and Pandya power, the Hoyasalas of Karnataka grew into prominence in south India and became the most important patrons centred at Mysore.\nThe three main temples of Hoyasala are the temples at Belur, Halebid and Somanathpuram.\nThe most characteristic feature of these temples is that they grow extremely complex with so many projecting angles emerging from the previously straightforward square temple so that the plan of these temples starts looking like a star.\nAs the plan looks like a star, it is known as stellate plan.\nThey are usually made out of soapstone.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Temples at Halebid, Karnataka:\n\nThe temple is also known as Hoyasaleswara temple.\nBuilt in dark schist stone by the Hoyasala king Vishnuvardhan in 1150.\nDedicated to Shiva as Nataraja and contains a large hall for the mandapa to facilitate music and dance.\nIn the bottom frieze of the temple featuring a continuous procession of hundreds of elephants with their mahouts, no two elephants are in the same position.\nVijayanagara\nThe Vijayanagara Empire, which was founded in the 14th century, attracted a number of international travelers such as the Italian, Nicoclo di Conti, the Portuguese Domingo Paes, Fernao Nuniz and Duarte Barbosa and the Afghan Abd, al- Razzaq, who have left vivid accounts of the city.\nArchitecturally, Vijayanagara synthesizes the centuries old dravida temple architecture with Islamic styles demonstrated by the neighbouring Sultanates.\nTheir sculptures too, which were consciously seeking to recreate Chola ideals, occasionally shows the presence of foreigners.\nBuddhist and Jain Architectural Developments\n\nThe period of 5th to 14th centuries was not only the period of the development of Hindu temples but also were the equally vibrant period for the Buddhist and Jain architectures.\n\nBuddhist Architecture\nWhen the Gupta empire crumbled in the 6th century CE, the eastern region of Bihar and Bengal, historically known as Magadha, appears to have remained unified whilst numerous small Rajput principalities sprang up to the west.\nIn the 8th century, the Palas came to power in the region.\nThe 2nd Pala ruler, Dharmapala, became immensely powerful and established an empire by defeating the powerful Rajput Pratiharas.\nDharmapala consolidated an empire whose wealth lay in a consolidation of agriculture along the fertile Ganges plain and international trade.\nBodhgaya, Bihar:\nBodhgaya became a pilgrimage site since Siddhartha achieved enlightenment here and became Gautama Buddha.\nThe Mahabodhi Temple at Bodhgaya is an important reminder of the brickwork of that time.\nThe first shrine here, located at the base of the Bodhi Tree, is said to have been constructed by King Ashoka.\nThe vedika (fence) around it is said to be Post-Mauryan, of about 100 BCE.\nMany sculptures in the temple are dated to the 8th century Pala period.\nThe actual Mahabodhi temple as it stands now is largely a colonial period reconstruction of the old 7th\nThe design of the temple is unusual and is neither Dravida nor nagara style.\nNalanda, Bihar:\nThe monastic University of Nalanda is a Mahavihara as it is a complex of several monasteries of various sizes.\nOnly a small portion of this ancient learning centre has been excavated till date, as most of it lies buried under contemporary civilization, making further excavations almost impossible.\nMost of the information about Nalanda is based on the records of Xuan Zang/Hsuan Tsang (Chinese traveller).\nIt states that the foundation of the monastery was laid by Kumaragupta I in the 5th century CE.\nAll three Buddhist doctrines \u2013 Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana \u2013 were taught here.\nMonks came to here from the different regions of the world such as China, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma, etc.\nMonks and pilgrims who came here take back small sculptures and illustrated manuscripts to their homeland, which resulted in a decisive impact on the arts of the Buddhist countries in Asia.\nThe sculptural art of Nalanda was developed out of a heavy dependence on the Buddhist Gupta art of Sarnath.\nThe Sculptures were mainly made in stucco, stone, and bronze.\nBy the 9th century, Nalanda school of sculpture was formed which was characterized by distinctive facial features, body forms, and treatment of clothing and jewellery.\nThe Nalanda sculptures initially depict Buddhist deities of the Mahayana tradition, such as standing Buddhas, bodhisattvas, etc.\nDuring the 11th and 12th centuries, Nalanda emerged as an important tantric centre and the sculptures during that period dominated by deities of Vajrayana tradition, such as Vajrasharada (a form of Saraswati), Khasarpana, Avalokiteswara, etc.\nVarious Brahmanical images have also been found at Nalanda.\nJain Architecture\nJains were also prolific temple builders like Hindus and their sacred shrines and pilgrimage spots can be found across the country.\nThe oldest Jain pilgrimage sites are to be found in Bihar.\nIn the Deccan, some of the most architecturally important Jain sites can be found at Ellora and Aihole.\nKarnataka has a rich heritage of Jain shrines and the Sravana Belagola, the famous statue of the Gomateswara, the granite statue of Lord Bahubali which stands eighteen metre, is the world\u2019s tallest monolithic free-standing structure.\nIt was commissioned by Camundaraya, the General-in-Chief and Prime Minister of the Ganga Kings of Mysore.\nGujarat and Rajasthan have been strongholds of Jainism since early times.\nThe Jain temples at Mount Abu (Dilwara Temples) were constructed by Vimal Shah.\nOne can see a complex of temples carved of white marble\nThe temples are famous for its unique patterns on very ceilings, and graceful bracket figs along the domed ceiling.\n\nArticle compiled by: Jijo Sudarsan"

        "[CONTENT]": "In this article, we discuss the Indian Bronze Sculptures. The post deals with bronze casting techniques, bronze sculptures in North and South India, and some of the important examples of bronze sculptures like Nataraja. As you rightly guessed, this article is a part of the Indian Culture series based on the NCERT textbook \u2018An Introduction to Indian Art\u2019.\n\nIn the previous posts, we have discussed in detail the Temple Architecture, Post Mauryan Trends in Indian Art and Architecture, etc. This is a continuation of those posts and the second last entry in the series.\n\nIndian bronze sculptures have a rich and ancient tradition that spans many centuries. The art of bronze casting in India has been practiced since the ancient period, and these sculptures are celebrated for their exquisite craftsmanship, attention to detail, and cultural significance.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIndian Bronze sculptures\nNorth India\nSouth India\nNataraja\nIndian Bronze sculptures\n\nWe know that Indian sculptures were masters in terracotta sculpturing and carving in stones. They were masters in the bronze medium too. (Bronze is Copper + Tin)\n\nThe \u2018Cire-Perdu\u2019 or \u2018Lost Wax\u2019 technique for casting was learned as long ago as the Indus Valley Civilization.\nThe \u2018Dancing Girl\u2019 in tribhanga posture found from Mohenjo-Daro is the earliest bronze sculpture datable to 2500 BCE.\nSculptors discovered the process of making alloys of metals by mixing copper, zinc, and tin which is called Bronze.\nBronze sculptures and statuettes of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain icons have been discovered in many regions of India dating from the 2nd century AD until the 16th century AD.\nMost of these were required for ritual worship and are characterized by exquisite beauty and aesthetic appeal.\nThe metal casting process was also used for making articles for various purposes of daily use, such as utensils for cooking, eating, drinking, etc.\nThe present-day tribal communities also utilize the \u2018lost wax\u2019 process for their artistic expression.\nNorth India\nDancing girl \u2013 Mohanjadaro.\nChariot \u2013 Daimabad (Maharashtra) datable to 1500\u00a0BCE.\nInteresting images of Jain Thirthankaras have been discovered from Chausa, Bihar, belonging to the Kushana period during the 2nd century CE.\nThese show how the Indian sculptors had mastered the modeling of masculine human physique and simplified muscles.\nRemarkable is the depiction of Adinath or Vrishabhanath, who is identified with long hair locks dropping to his shoulders. Otherwise, the thirthankaras are noted by their short curly hair.\nMany standing Buddha images with a right hand in Abhaya Mudra were cast in North India, particularly in UP and Bihar, during the Gupta and the Post-Gupta periods.\nThe Sanghati or the Monk robe is wrapped to cover the shoulders, which turn over the arm, while the other end of the drapery is wrapped over the left arm.\nThe clothes of Buddha figures were thin.\nThe figure appears youthful and proportionate in comparison with the Kushana style.\nIn the typical bronze from Dhanesar Khera, UP, the folds of the drapery are treated as in the Mathura style, i.e., in a series of dropping-down curves.\nSarnath-style bronze has foldless drapery and an outstanding example is that of the Buddha image at Sultanganj, Bihar, which is a quiet monumental bronze figure.\nVakataka bronze images of Buddha from Phophnar, Maharashtra are contemporary with the Gupta period bronzes. They show the influence of the Amaravati style of Andhra Pradesh in the 3rd century and at the same time, there is a significant change in the draping style of monk\u2019s robe.\nBuddha\u2019s right hand in Abhaya Mudra is free so that the contemporary drapery clings to the right side of the body contour. The result is a continuous flowing line on this side of the figure.\nThe additional importance of the Gupta and Vakataka bronze is that they were portable and monks carried them from place to place for individual worship or to be installed in Buddhist Viharas.\nIn this manner, the refined classical style spread to different parts of India and Asian countries overseas.\nHimachal Pradesh and Kashmir regions also produced bronze images of Buddhist deities as well as Hindu gods and goddesses.\nMost of these were created during the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries and have a very distinct style in comparison with bronze from other parts of India.\nA noteworthy development is the growth of different types of iconography of Vishnu images.\nFour-headed Vishnu, also known as Chaturanana or Vaikuntha Vishnu, was worshipped in these regions.\nIn Buddhist centers like Nalanda, a school of bronze casting emerged around the 9th century, during the rule of the Pala dynasty in Bihar and Bengal regions.\nIn the gap of a few centuries, the sculptors at Kurkihar near Nalanda were able to revive the classical style of the Gupta period.\nA remarkable bronze is of a four-armed Avalokiteswara, which is a good example of a male figure in graceful tribhanga posture.\nWorship of female goddesses was adopted which is a part of the growth of the Vajrayana phase in Buddhism. Images of Tara became popular. Seated on the throne, she is accompanied by a growing curvilinear lotus stalk and her right hand is in Abhaya Mudra.\nSouth India\n\nThe bronze casting technique and making of bronze images of traditional icons reached a high stage of development in South India during the medieval period.\n\nAmong the Pallava period bronze of the 8th century, the best one is the icon of Shiva seated in Ardhaparyanka asana (one leg kept dangling). The right hand is in the Achamana Mudra gesture, suggesting that he is about to drink poison.\nAlthough bronze images were modeled and cast during the Pallava period in the 8th and 9th centuries, some of the most beautiful statues were produced during the Chola period in Tamil Nadu from the 10th to the 12th century AD.\nThe technique of art fashioning bronze images is still skilfully practiced in South India, particularly in Kumbakonam.\n\nChola Bronzes (9th to 13th centuries):\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe distinguished patron during the 10th century was the widowed Chola Queen, Sembiyan Maha Devi.\nChola bronze images are the most sought-after collectors\u2019 items by art lovers all over the world.\nThe well-known dancing figure of Shiva as Nataraja evolved and fully developed during the Chola period and since then many variations of this complex bronze image have been modeled.\nA wide range of Shiva iconography was evolved in the Tanjore region of Tamil Nadu.\nThe 9th-century\u00a0Kalyanasundara Murti is highly remarkable for how panigrahana (ceremony of marriage) is represented by two separate statuettes.\nShiva with his extended right hand accepts Parvati\u2019s (the bride\u2019s) right hand, who is depicted with a bashful expression and taking a step forward.\nThe union of Shiva and Parvati is very ingeniously represented in the Ardhanarisvra in a single image. Beautiful independent figurines of Parvati have also been modeled, standing in the graceful tribhanga posture.\n\nVijayanagara Bronzes (14th to 17th centuries):\n\nDuring the 16th century known as the Vijayanagara period in Andhra Pradesh, the sculptors experimented with portrait sculpture to preserve knowledge of the royal patrons for prosperity. At Tirupati, the life-size standing portrait statue was cast in bronze, depicting Krishnadevaraya with his two queens, Tirumalamba and Chinnadevi.\n\nThe sculpture has combined the likeness of the facial features with certain elements of idealization.\nThe idealization is further observed in the manner the physical body is modeled to appear imposing as well as graceful.\nThe standing King and Queens are depicted in a praying posture, that is, both hands in the Namaskara mudra.\nThe Vijayanagara Empire, which flourished in the 14th to 17th centuries, continued the tradition of bronze casting with a focus on Hindu deities and mythological figures.\nThe sculptures from this period often exhibit a robust and dynamic quality, with attention to realistic anatomy and intricate ornamentation.\nNATARAJA\n\nThe Nataraja statue, also known as the \u201cDancing Shiva\u201d or \u201cLord of the Dance,\u201d is a famous and iconic representation of the Hindu deity Shiva in his cosmic dance form. This Indian bronze sculpture has deep symbolic significance in Hinduism and is considered a powerful artistic and spiritual expression. Here are some key features and interpretations associated with the Nataraja statue:\n\nIconography:\n\nDancing Pose: The Nataraja is depicted in a dynamic dance pose, known as the \u201cAnanda Tandava\u201d or \u201cDance of Bliss.\u201d The dance symbolizes the cosmic cycles of creation, preservation, and destruction.\nMultiple Arms: Shiva is often depicted with multiple arms, each holding symbolic objects. These objects include a drum (damaru) symbolizing the sound of creation, fire (Agni) representing destruction, a raised hand (abhaya mudra) signifying protection, and a pointing foot (nritya hasta) symbolizing the defeat of ignorance.\n\nCosmic Symbolism:\n\nThe Nataraja\u2019s dance represents the eternal rhythm of the universe. The dance is seen as both an act of creation and destruction, highlighting the cyclical nature of life, death, and rebirth.\nThe circle of fire surrounding Shiva symbolizes the cosmic energy and the process of creation and dissolution.\n\nApasmara Purusha:\n\nThe figure of a dwarf, known as Apasmara Purusha or Muyalaka, lies under Shiva\u2019s foot. This represents the triumph of Shiva over ignorance and the forces of illusion (Maya).\n\nSacred Geometry:\n\nThe Nataraja often stands within a circular or elliptical frame, representing the cosmic cycle and the wheel of time. The symbolism is closely linked to Hindu concepts of time, eternity, and the cyclical nature of existence.\n\nIndian bronze sculptures not only serve as religious and artistic artifacts but also offer insights into the cultural, spiritual, and technological achievements of ancient Indian civilizations. Many of these sculptures are housed in museums and collections around the world, showcasing the enduring legacy of this artistic tradition.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Modern Indian Sculpture\n\nArticle compiled by: Jijo Sudarsan"

This is the last chapter (8th) of the NCERT textbook \u2018An Introduction to Indian Art\u2019 \u2013 Part 1.\n\nThis post finishes our task of covering the highlights of the book in an exam-friendly manner, but we don\u2019t stop creating \u2018easy-to-read articles\u2019 for our readers here. We will surely come up with more articles on Indian culture (topics like Painting, Dances, etc) from other sources soon.\n\nHere we discuss various examples of Indo-Islamic architecture, their styles, certain decoration techniques, etc. In previous posts, we have already discussed the ancient art and architecture.

\ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndo-Islamic architecture developed distinct decorative styles in the subcontinent.\n\nThese forms include designing on plasters through incisions or stucco.\nThe designs were either left plain or covered with colors.\nMotifs were also painted on or carved in stones.\nThese motifs include varieties of flowers, both from the sub-continent and places outside, particularly Iran.\nThe lotus bridge fringe was used to great advantage in the inner curves of the arches.\nThe walls were also decorated with Cypress, Chinar, and other trees as well as flower vases.\nMany complex designs of flower motifs decorating the ceiling were also to be found on textiles and carpets.\nIn the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, tiles were also used to surface the walls and the domes.\nPopular colors were blue, turquoise, green, and yellow.\nSubsequently, the techniques of tessellation (mosaic designs) and pietra dura (cut and fit technique) were used for surface decoration, particularly in the dodo panels of the walls.\n\nAt times, Lapis Lazuli (a kind of blue stone) was used on the interior walls or canopies.\nArabesque (surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, and tendrils), calligraphy, Jalis (perforated stone or latticed screen), etc. were other decorative works.\nConstructing Materials\nThe walls in all buildings were extremely thick and were largely constructed of rubble masonry, which was easily available.\nThese walls were then cased over with chunam or limestone plaster or dressed stone.\nAn amazing range of stones were utilized for construction such as quartzite, sandstone, buffs, marbles, etc.\nPolychrome tiles were used to great advantage to finish the walls.\nFrom the 17th century onwards, bricks were also used for construction, and in this phase, there was more reliance on local materials.\nForts\n\nAnother feature was concentric circles of outer walls as in Golconda where the enemy had to breach these at all stages before getting in.\nSome of the famous forts are the Fort of Chittor (Rajasthan), Gwalior (MP), Daulatabad-earlier Devgiri (Maharashtra), and Golconda (Hyderabad).\nThe Chittorgarh fort is the largest in Asia and was occupied for the longest length of time as the seat of power.\nMinars\n\nAnother form of sthamba or tower was the minar, a common feature in the sub-continent which portrays the perfect blend in Indo-Islamic architecture.\n\nThe most striking minars of medieval times are the Qutub Minar in Delhi and Chand Minar at Daulatabad.\nThe everyday use of the minar was for the azaan or call to prayer.\nIts phenomenal height, however, symbolized the might and power of the ruler.\n\nEg: Qutub Minar\n\nIt was built in the 13th century and the Qutub complex in which the minar is present is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe construction of the bottom storey of the minar was started by Qutub-ud-din Aibak (Delhi Sultanate) and his successor Iltumish completed it by adding three more storeys.\nHowever, Firoz Shah Tughlaq replaced the top story which was damaged by lightning and also added one more storey.\nHence now it has five storeys and a height of nearly 234 feet (about 73 m) making it the second tallest minar in India (first is Fateh Burj, Punjab).\nThe Qutub Minar also came to be associated with the much-revered saint of Delhi, Khwaja Qutubuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki.\nThe minar is a mixture of polygonal and circular shapes.\nIt is largely built on red and buff stone with some use of marble in the upper storeys.\nIt is characterized by high decorative balconies and bands of inscriptions intertwined with foliated designs.\n\nEg: Chand minar\n\nIt was built in the 15th century by Ala-ud-din Bahmani.\nIt is a 210 feet high (about 30 m) tapering tower divided into four storeys.\nIt is painted in peach now.\nIts fa\u00e7ade once boasted of chevron patterning on the encaustic tile work and a bold band of Quranic verses.\nAlthough it looked like an Iranian monument, it was the combined handiwork of local architects with those from Delhi and Iran.\nTombs\n\nMonumental structures over the graves of rulers and royalty were a popular feature of medieval India and a jewel of Indo-Islamic Architecture.\n\nSome well-known examples of such tombs are those of Ghyasuddin Tughlaq, Humayun, Adur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan, Akbar, and Itmaduddaula.\nThe idea behind the tomb was eternal paradise as a reward for the true believer on the Day of Judgment. This leads to the paradisiacal imagery for tombs.\nBeginning with the introduction of Quranic verses on the walls, the tomb was subsequently placed with paradisiacal elements such as a garden or near a water body or both, as in the case of the Taj Mahal.\nThey were not only intended to signify peace and happiness in the next world but also to showcase the majesty, grandeur, and might of the person buried there.\n\nEg: Taj Mahal\n\nTaj Mahal was built in Agra by Shah Jahan as a mausoleum (a kind of large tomb) for his deceased wife Mumtaz Mahal.\nIt was commissioned in the year 1632 and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe Taj Mahal was the apogee of the evolutionary architectural process in medieval India.\nThe Taj complex is entered through a monumental red sandstone gateway, the opening arch of which beautifully frames the mausoleum.\nThe tomb is laid out in a Chahar Bagh (garden), crisscrossed with paths and water courses, interspersed with pools and fountains.\nThe structure is placed on the northern extremity of the bagh instead of the middle to take advantage of the river bank (Yamuna).\nThe straight path through the bagh reaches the plinth of the tomb.\nAt the corners of the terrace stand four tall minarets, one hundred and thirty-two feet high.\nThe main body of the building is topped with a drum a dome and four cupolas forming a beautiful skyline.\nTowards the west of the white marble-faced tomb lies a red sandstone mosque and a similar construction in the east to maintain balance.\nThe marble for the building was quarried from the Makrana Mines, Rajasthan.\nThe inner arrangement of the mausoleum consists of a crypt below and a vaulted, octagonal tomb chamber, with a room at each angle, all connected by corridors.\nLight to every part of the building is obtained using carved and perforated Jalis, set in the arched recesses of the interior.\nFour types of embellishments have been used with great effect for the interior and exterior surfaces of the Taj Mahal.\nThese are stone carvings in high and low relief on the walls, the delicate carving of marble into jails and graceful volutes (spiral ornament on the pillars), and the creation of arabesque with pietra dura on walls and tombstones and geometric designs with tessellation.\nThe art of calligraphy is used with the inlay of jasper in white marble to unite Quranic verses.\nCalligraphy provides a decorative element on the walls and a continuous connection with the almighty.\n\nEg: Gol Gumbad, Karnataka\n\nIt is situated in the Bijapur district of Karnataka.\nIt is the mausoleum of Muhammed Adil Shah, the 7th sultan of the Adil Shahi Dynasty of Bijapur (1498-1686).\nBuilt by the ruler himself, it is a striking edifice despite being unfinished.\nThe tomb is a complex building such as a gateway, a Naqqar Khana, a mosque, and a Sarai located within a large walled garden.\nGumbad is a square building topped with a circular drum over which rests a majestic dome, giving the building its nomenclature.\nIt is built of dark grey basalt and decorated plasterwork.\nThe dome of Gol Gumbad is the largest in the world.\nThe building has an amazing acoustical system. Along with the drum of the dome, there is a whispering gallery where sounds get magnified and echoed many times over.\nGol Gumbad is a fine convergence of many styles located in medieval India.\nWhile its structural peculiarities of dome, arches, geometric proportions, and load-bearing techniques suggest Timurid and Persian styles, it is made of local material and is decorated with surface embellishments popular in Deccan.\nSarais\nSarais were largely built on a simple square or rectangular plan and were meant to provide temporary accommodation for Indian and foreign travelers, pilgrims, merchants, traders, etc.\nThey were public domains that thronged with people of varied cultural backgrounds.\nThis leads to cross-cultural interaction, influence, and syncretic tendencies in the cultural mores of the times and at the level of people.\nStructures for Common People\n\nOne of the Indo-Islamic architectural features of medieval India was also a coming together of styles, techniques, and decorations in public and private spaces for non-royal sections of the society.\n\nThese include buildings for domestic usage, temples, mosques, khanqahs, and dargahs, commemorative gateways, pavilions in buildings and gardens, bazaars, etc.\n\nJama Masjid\n\nLarge mosques spanning huge spaces also dotted the landscapes of the Indian sub-continent in medieval times.\nCongregational prayers were held here every Friday afternoon, which required the presence of a minimum of forty Muslim male adults.\nAt the time of prayers, a khutba was read out in the name of the ruler and his laws for the realm were also read out.\nIn medieval times, a city had one Jama Masjid which, along with its immediate surroundings, became the focus of the lives of the people, both Muslim and non-Muslim.\nThis happened because a lot of commercial and cultural exchanges were concentrated here besides religious and indirect political activity.\nGenerally, such a mosque was large with an open courtyard, surrounded on three sides by cloisters and the Qibla Liwan in the west.\nIt was here that the mihrab and mimbar for the Imam were located.\nPeople faced the mihrab while offering prayers as it indicated the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca.\nIndo-Islamic Architecture: Provincial influence\n\nThe city of Mandu is located in Madhya Pradesh, at an elevation of over 2000 feet, and overlooks the Malwa Plateau to the north and the Narmada Valley to the south.\n\nMandu\u2019s natural defense encouraged consistent habitation by Parmana Rajputs, Afghans, and Mughals.\nAs the capital city of the Ghauri Dynasty (1401-1561) founded by Hoshang Shah, it acquired a lot of fame.\nMandu was associated with the romance of Sultan Baz Bahadur and Rani Rupamati.\nThe Mughals resorted to it for pleasure during the monsoon season.\n\nMandu is a typical representation of the medieval provincial style of art and architecture influenced by Indo-Islamic architecture.\n\nIt was a complex mix of official and residential-cum-pleasure palaces, and pavilions, light and airy so that these buildings did not retain heat.\nLocal stone and marble were used to great advantage.\nThe royal enclave located in the city comprised the most complete and romantic set of buildings, a cluster of palaces and attendant structures, official and residential, built around two artificial lakes.\n\nEg: The Hindola Mahal, Mandu\n\nIt looks like a railway viaduct bridge with its disproportionately large buttresses supporting the walls.\nThis was the audience hall of the Sultan and the place where he showed himself to his subjects.\nThe batter was used very effectively to give an impression of swinging (Hindola) walls.\n\nEg: Jahaaz Mahal, Mandu\n\nIt is an elegant two-storey \u2018Ship Palace\u2019 between two reservoirs, with an open pavilion, balconies overhanging the water, and a terrace.\nIt was built by Sultan Ghiyasuddin Khilji and was possibly used as his harem and the ultimate pleasure and recreation resort.\nIt had a complex arrangement of watercourses and a terrace swimming pool.\n\nEg: Rani Rupamati\u2019s Pavilion, Mandu\n\nRani Rupamati\u2019s double pavilion perched on the southern embattlements afforded a beautiful view of the Narmada valley.\nBaz Bahadur\u2019s Palace had a wide courtyard ringed with halls and a terrace.\n\nEg: Hoshang Shah\u2019s Tomb, Mandu\n\nIt is a majestic structure with a beautiful dome, marble jaliwork, porticos, courts, and towers.\nIt is regarded as an example of the robustness of Afghan structures, but its lattice works, carved brackets, and torans lend it a softer hue.\n\nEg: Jama Masjid, Mandu\n\nIt was built on a large scale to accommodate many worshippers for Friday prayers.\nThe building is faced with red sandstone.\nThe Mimbar (where the Imam stands to deliver sermons) in the Quibla liwan (a long narrowed hall) is supported on carved brackets and the Mihrab has a lotus bud fringe.\n\nArticle by: Jijo Sudarshan"

        "[CONTENT]": "Indian Philosophy or Hindu Philosophy is generally classified into 6 orthodox schools (\u0101stika) and 3 heterodox (n\u0101stika) schools.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDifference between Astik schools and Nastik schools\nSix Orthodox Schools (Classical Schools) of Indian Philosophy\nSankhya Philosophy\nYoga Philosophy\nNyaya Philosophy\nVaisheshik\u00a0Philosophy\nPurva mimansa (mimansa)\nUttara Mimamsa (Vedanta)\nThree\u00a0Heterodox Schools of Indian Philosophy\nCarvaka\nBuddhist Philosophy\nJain Philosophy\nAjivika Philosophy\nReferences:\nUPSC Questions related to Hindu Philosophy\nDifference between Astik schools and Nastik schools\n\nThe basic difference between the two branches of Hindu Philosophy schools is said to be based on the recognition of Vedas. Orthodox schools recognize the authority of Vedas while heterodox schools don\u2019t believe in the authority of Vedas.\n\nOut of these nine systems, eight are atheistic as there is no place for God in them. Only Uttara Mimansa, which is also called Vedanta, has a place for God in it.\n\nSix Orthodox Schools (Classical Schools) of Indian Philosophy\n\nThe 6 classical schools (shatdarshan) are Sankhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshik, Purva Mimansa and Uttar Mimansa (Vedanta). Almost all Indian schools of thought accepted the theory of karma and rebirth, and the ideal of moksha is conceived as liberation from the cycle of births and deaths. Moksha/liberation is considered the highest goal of human struggle.\n\nSankhya Philosophy\n\nSankhya is the oldest philosophy. It was put forward by Kapila.\n\nSankhya philosophy provided the materialistic ontology for Nyaya and Vaisheshik, but there is very little original literature in Sankhya.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIt is generally believed that Sankhya Philosophy is\u00a0dualistic and not monistic because it has two entities, purush\u00a0(spirit) and prakriti (nature) in it. Samkhya emphasizes the attainment of knowledge of the self by means of concentration and meditation.\n\nSankhya holds that it is self-knowledge that leads to liberation and not any exterior influence or agent. Samkhya forms the philosophical basis for Yoga. In Samkhya, the necessity of God is not felt for epistemological clarity about the interrelationship between higher Self, individual self, and the universe around us.\n\nPurush vs Prakriti: In the beginning, the philosophy was materialistic as it talked only about Prakrithi, but later the element of purush was also added to it. While Purusha is posited as the only sentient being, ever-existent, and immaterial, Prakriti is said to be the material basis of this universe, composed of three basic elements (Gunas) \u2013 namely Tamas, Rajas, and Sattva.\n\nYoga Philosophy\n\nYoga presents a method of physical and mental discipline.\n\nYoga presents a practical path for the realization of the self whereas the Samkhya emphasizes the attainment of knowledge of the self by means of concentration and meditation. Releasing Purush from Prakriti by means of physical and mental discipline is the concept of Yoga.\n\nThe founder of Yoga is Patanjali. Yoga does not require belief in God, although such a belief is accepted as help in the initial stage of mental concentration and control of the mind.\n\nNyaya Philosophy\n\nNyaya Philosophy states that nothing is acceptable unless it is in accordance with reason and experience (scientific approach). The founder of this philosophy is Gautam and the principles are mentioned in Nyaya Sutras. Nyaya says that the world is real and the philosophy does not follow a monist view.\n\nNyaya philosophy relies on several pramanas i.e. means of obtaining true knowledge as its epistemology. According to it, the pradhan pramana or principal means of obtaining knowledge is pratyaksha pramana i.e. the knowledge obtained through the 5 senses. There are also other pramanas like\u00a0anumana (inference, through which we can obtain true knowledge) and shabda pramana (a statement of an expert).\n\nNB: Subsequent philosophers who claimed to be Nyayiks, e.g. Vatsyayan (who wrote Nyaya Bhashya), Udayan (who wrote Kusumanjali) etc. distorted the Nyaya philosophy by introducing theological elements in it. Navya Nyaya scholars like Gangesh resorted to gymnastics in logic.\n\nVaisheshik\u00a0Philosophy\n\nThe classical Indian philosophy Vaisheshik was the physics of ancient times. It propounded the atomic theory of its founder Kannada. At one time Vaisheshik was regarded as part of the Nyaya philosophy since physics is part of science. But since physics is the most fundamental of all sciences, Vaisheshik was later separated from Nyaya and put forth as a separate philosophy. To make it short, Vaisheshik is a realistic and objective philosophy of the universe.\n\nPurva mimansa (mimansa)\n\nThe word Mimamsa means to analyze and understand thoroughly. \u00a0Purva Mimamsa examines the teachings of the Veda in the light of karma-kanda rituals, ie karma-mimamsa system is called purva-mimamsa. Purva mimansa (or briefly mimansa) lays emphasis on the performance of the yagya for attaining various spiritual and worldly benefits. \u00a0Hence this philosophy relies on the Brahmana (and samhita) part of the Vedas.\n\nUttara Mimamsa (Vedanta)\n\nVedanta says that the world is unreal, Maya. Vedanta is monistic, in other words, it says that there is only one reality, Brahman. Vedanta lays emphasis on brahmagyan, hence relies on the Upanishad part of the Vedas. Vedanta has its roots in Sankya Philosophy.\n\nThere are three sub-branches for Vedanta :\n\nAbsolute Monism of Shankara\nVishishtha Advaita or qualified monism of Ramanuja\nDvaita of Madhva\n\nPS: A close examination shows that the first 4 classical systems are not entirely based on Vedas. But the last two, the Purva Mimansa and the Uttar Mimansa, certainly rely on the Vedas.\n\nThree\u00a0Heterodox Schools of Indian Philosophy\n\nSchools that do not accept the authority of Vedas are by definition unorthodox (nastika) systems. The following schools belong to heterodox schools of Indian Philosophy.\n\nCarvaka\n\nIt is characterised as a materialistic and aesthetic school of thought. Accepted direct perception as the surest method to prove the truth of anything. Insists on joyful living.\n\nAlso known as Lokayata, Carvaka is a materialistic school of thought. Its founder was Carvaka, author of the Barhaspatya Sutras in the final centuries B.C.\n\nThe original texts have been lost and our understanding of them is based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools. As early as the 5th Century, Saddaniti and Buddhaghosa connected the Lokayatas with the Vitandas (or Sophists), and the term Carvaka was first recorded in the 7th Century by the philosopher Purandara, and in the 8th Century by Kamalasila and Haribhadra.\n\nBuddhist Philosophy\n\nIt is a system of beliefs based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama. Buddhism is a non-theistic philosophy whose tenets are not especially concerned with the existence or non-existence of God.\n\nFour Noble Truths in Buddhism are the following.\n\nThere is suffering\nThere is a cause of suffering\nThere is a cessation of suffering\nThere is a way to cessation of suffering\n\nBuddhists philosophy of life to get \u2018Nirvana\u2019 from suffering is based on the following eight principles:\n\nRight Faith (Samyak Dristi)\nRight Resolve (Samyak Sankalpa)\nRight Speech (Samyak Vakya)\nRight Action (Samyak Karmanta)\nRight Living ( Samyak Ajiva)\nRight Thought (Samyak Smriti)\nRight concentration (Samyak Samadhi)\nRight Effort (Samyak Vyayama)\nJain Philosophy\n\nAlready in existence by the 6th century B.C, it was revived by Mahavira, the 24th Jain Tirthankara. According to Jainism, Nirvana or liberation is obtained through three jewels: Right Philosophy, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct (Tri-ratna). Right conduct implies 5 abstinences: not to lie, not to steal, not to strive for luxury and not to strive for possessions, not to be unchaste and not to injure (Ahimsa).\n\nAjivika Philosophy\n\nA related philosophy that some classify under the heterodox system is Ajivika Philosophy. The \u0100j\u012bvikas may simply have been a more loosely organized group of wandering ascetics (shramanas or sannyasins). Some of its prominent figures were Makkhali Gosala and Sanjaya Belatthaputta. This was an ascetic movement of the Mahajanapada period in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nReferences:\nInternational Forum for Neovedantins.\nPhilosophy basics.\nUPSC Questions related to Hindu Philosophy\n\nQn: With reference to the history of philosophical thought in India, consider the following statements regarding Sankhya school: (2013 CSE Prelims)\n\nSankhya does not accept the theory of rebirth or transmigration of the soul.\nSankhya holds that it is self-knowledge that leads to liberation and not any exterior influence or agent.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is /are correct?\n\nA \u2013 1only\nB \u2013 2 only\nC \u2013 Both 1 and 2\nD \u2013 Neither 1 nor 2\n\nAns:\u00a0B \u2013 2 only\n\nQn.

Every one of us is capable of this. ~ Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nThe ideal of Bodhisattva beholds the highest moral principle of intellect and discipline in Buddhism for the sake of happiness of all the other beings.\n\nHowever, the concept is seen with slight variation in different schools of Buddhism.\n\nBodhisattva in Buddhist Philosophy\n\nThe schools of Theravada Buddhism (early school) and Mahayana Buddhism understand Bodhisattva in different ways.\n\nBodhisattva in Theravada Buddhism: It refers to a person who has taken a spontaneous vow to become a Buddha, and in addition to this, such a person is also assured by a living Buddha regarding the fulfilment of the vow. The school focuses on previous lives of Buddha before he attained enlightenment.\nBodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism: It is an object of devotion as Mahayana Buddhism inspires others to walk on the path of Bodhisattva because the school believes that every individual possesses an inherent nature like Budhha and hence, anyone can become Budhha.\n\nTo make it simple, while Bodhisattva path is an optional path for a heroic few like Sidharth Gautama Budha in Therav\u0101da (or Hinayana sect) it is a normative path in Mah\u0101y\u0101na.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nFour Virtues of a Bodhisattva (The Brahmaviharas)\n\nWhen a living being (sattva) develops the state of enlightenment (bodhi), that person exhibits four Buddhist virtues, also known as Brahmaviharas. These four Brahmaviharas are as following:\n\nMaitri (Loving-kindness): It refers to goodwill towards all.\nKaruna (Compassion): It denotes identification of the suffering of others as one\u2019s own.\nMuditaa (Empathetic joy): It is the feeling of bliss as others are happy, even if a person has not contributed to it, it is a form of empathetic joy.\nUpekshaa (Equanimity): It refers to even-mindedness and serenity, treating everyone impartially.\nEight Prominent Bodhisattvas\n\nThere are 8 important Bodhisattvas who represent different aspects of Buddha. They are as following:\n\nAvalokitesvara (Buddha\u2019s Compassion): Avalokiteshwara means one who can see all. He represents infinite compassion and mercy. He is the most popular Bodhisattva of all. He represents the ideal of welfare in which he postpones his own transformation into Buddha to help others.\nManjusri (Buddha\u2019s Wisdom): The literal meaning of his name is \u2018Gentle Glory\u2019. He represents Pragya or transcendental wisdom at a very early age.\nSamantabhadra (Buddha\u2019s Aspirations): The meaning of Samantabhadra is \u2018Universal Worthy\u2019 and he is associated with practice and meditation. He made ten vows to fulfil his journey of becoming a Buddha.\nKsitigarbha (Buddha\u2019s Merit): He is popular as a Buddhist monk in the mostly East Asia. While the name literally means Earth Womb, he is revered as the guardian of children and patron deity of deceased children. He carries a staff.\nMaitreya (Buddha\u2019s Activity): He is also known as Ajita Boddhisattva. It is believed that he will arrive when people will forget the path of righteousness. He is considered as the successor of Gautam Buddha. In Buddhist traditions, he is revered as someone who will achieve complete enlightenment and will teach dharma to people.\nVajrapani (Buddha\u2019s Power): He is described as one of the 3 protective deities around Buddha, others are Manjusri and Avlokiteshwara. Vajrapani represents Buddha\u2019s power while Buddha\u2019s wisdom is symbolised by Manjushri, and Avalokiteshwara manifests as Buddha\u2019s compassion.\nSarvanivarana-Vishkambhin (Buddha\u2019s Qualities): He is invoked to remove or eliminate all the obstacles to insure a successful meditation.\nAkasagarbha (Buddha\u2019s Blessings): He is boundless as space. He was the twin brother of Ksitigarbha. He manifests as a blessing.\nThe iconography of Bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara\n\nNote: Image worship and deification is a central feature of Bodhisattva cult. The picture above shows the iconography of Bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara (Source: Vajra Publications: https://pages.vassar.edu/embodyingcompassion/iconography/)\n\nParamitas or Path to Perfection for becoming a Bodhisattva\n\nA Bodhisattva practices paramita to become a Buddha by developing goodness to others without any trace of selfish behaviour.\n\nParamita, or perfection in Buddhism is associated with noble qualities that are found in Buddha-like enlightened beings.\n\nThese qualities are:\n\nDaan parami: generosity, giving of oneself\nSheel parami: virtue, morality, proper conduct\nNishkaam parami: renunciation\nPanna parami: wisdom, discernment\nVirya parami: energy, diligence, vigour, effort\nShanti parami: patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance\nSacha parami: truthfulness, honesty\nAdhi\u1e6d\u1e6dhana parami: determination, resolution\nMetta parami: goodwill, friendliness, loving-kindness\nUpekkh\u0101 p\u0101ram\u012b: equanimity, serenity\nConcept of Bhumi\n\nAccording to many traditions within Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, on the way to becoming a Buddha, a bodhisattva proceeds through ten, or sometimes fourteen, grounds or bhumis. Below is the list of the ten prominent bhumis and their descriptions:\n\nGreat Joy: It is a state to being which is close to enlightenment and seeing the welfare for all living beings, one achieves great joy, hence the name. In this bh\u016bmi a bodhisattva practices and exercises all perfections (paramitas), but significantly emphasize upon generosity (daan).\nStainless: While accomplishing the second stage of bhumi, a bodhisattva is free from the stains of immorality, therefore, this form of bh\u016bmi is called \u201cstainless\u201d. The emphasized perfection is virtue (sheela).\nLuminous: The light of Dharma is said to radiate for the good of others from the bodhisattva who achieves and accomplishes the third bhumi. The emphasized perfection is the virtue of patience (shaanti).\nRadiant: This bh\u016bmi it is said to be like a exhibiting light that consumes everything which opposes enlightenment. The emphasized perfection is penance and vigor. (veerya).\nVery difficult to train: A Bodhisattva who attains this ground lives and strives to help sentient beings attain maturity, and does not become emotionally engaged when such beings respond negatively, both of which are difficult to do. The emphasized perfection focusses upon meditative concentration (dhyaana).\nObviously Transcendent: By depending on the perfection of wisdom, the bodhisattva does not abide in either sa\u1e43saara or nirvaa\u1e47a, so this state is \u201cobviously transcendent\u201d. The emphasized perfection is wisdom (pragya).\nGone afar: In this bhumi, special emphasis is on the perfection of skillful means (upaaya), to help others.\nImmovable: The emphasized quality is aspiration. This \u201cimmovable\u201d bhumi refers to a state where one becomes able to choose his place of rebirth.\nGood Discriminating Wisdom: The main quality at this stage is the understanding of self and non-self.\nCloud of Dharma: At this level of bhumi, emphasized virtue is the practise of primordial wisdom.\n\nAfter the ten bh\u016bmis, according to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, one attains complete enlightenment and becomes a Buddha.\n\nParamitas in Buddhism and Pancha Parameshthi in Jainism\n\nJust like Paramitas in Buddhism, a similar concept of Pancha Parameshthi is popular in Jainism. Pancha Parameshthi is the hierarchy of religious authorities in Jainism. They are as following:\n\nArihants: The word comes from ari (enemy) and hant (to destroy). An Arihanta destroys the vices that arises within the mind and body like anger and gree. This is the highest authority in Jainism that attract a lot of veneration for the highest form of penance that it practices.\n\nSidhhas: These are the souls that have gained emancipation and are free from the cycles of birth and death. Arihants eventually become sidhhas but they are revered more as they encourage others to follow the noble path.\n\nAcharyas: These are the heads of different orders in Jainism. They lead the groups of monks, nuns, ordinary women and men. They direct the functions of the order and maintain discipline in the Sangh.\n\nUpadhyayas: These are the authorities on scriptures of Jainism. They disseminate knowledge among people.\n\nSaints or Monks-These are the people who have renounced the world for spiritual pursuits. They observe five major vows (Mahavrata): three controls (guptis), five types of vigilance (Samitis), ten commandments (dharma), twelve penances (tap) etc. The monks are required to observe these rules strictly.\n\nPrevious Years Questions on Bodhisattva in UPSC CSE:\n\n2016\n\nWith reference to the religious history of India, consider the following statements :\n\nThe concept of Bodhisattva is central to the Hinayana sect of Buddhism.\nBodhisattva is a compassionate one on his way to enlightenment.\nBodhisattva delays achieving his own salvation to help all sentient beings on their path to it.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 2 and 3 only\n\n(c) 2 only\n\n(d) 1, 2 and 3\n\nCorrect Answer: b\n\n2018\n\nWith reference to Indian history, who among the following is a future Buddha, yet to come to save the world?\n\n(a) Avalokiteshvara\n\n(b) Lokesvara\n\n(c) Maitreya\n\n(d) Padmapani\n\nCorrect Answer: c\n\n2019\n\nConsider the following :\n\nThe deification of the Buddha\nTreading the path of Bodhisattvas\nImage worship and rituals\n\nWhich of the above is/ are the feature/ features of Mahayana Buddhism?\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 1 and 2 only\n\n(c) 2 and 3 only\n\n(d) 1, 2 and 3\n\nCorrect Answer: d\n\n2020\n\nWith reference to the cultural history of India, which one of the following is the correct description of the term \u2018paramitas\u2019?\n\n(a) The earliest dharmashastra texts are written in aphoristic (Sutra) style\n\n(b) Philosophical schools that did not accept the authority of Vedas.\n\n(c) Perfections whose attainment led to the Bodhisattva path\n\n(d) Powerful merchant guilds of early medieval South India.\n\nCorrect Answer: c\n\nBibliographical Sources:\nIn Drops of Nectar: Khenpo Kunpal\u2019s Commentary on Shantideva\u2019s Entering the Conduct of the Bodhisattvas, www.kunpal.org, vol. 1 p.282\nTran Thi Binh, Different Ideas of Bodhisattva Characteristics, The Journal of the International Buddhist Studies College\nHar Dayal, The Bodhisattva Doctrine in Buddhist Literature, Motilal Banarsidass Publications, New Delhi, 1970\nDhammapala, Acariya, A treatise on the Paramis, tr.

Kanchipuram was the capital of the Pallavas from the 4th to the 9th century. Huen Tsang had visited this city and wrote it a glorious city.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Pallava architecture shows the transition from the rock-cut temples to the stone-built temples. \u00a0The earliest examples of Pallava art are the rock-cut temples of the 7th century CE, while the later examples are structural temples built in the 8th and 9th centuries.\n\nThe lasting monolithic temples known as rathas and mandapas provided superb skill for sculptors of the Pallava period. The monolithic temples (e.g.: Five Rathas) gave way to structural temples like the Shore temple in Mammalapuram.\n\nMajor Pallava rulers who built temples\nMahendravarman :\u00a0Mandagapattu rock cut temple.\nRajsimha (Narsimhamvaraman/Kalasamudra/Mammalla) :\u00a0Kailasanathar Temple, Kanchipuram, Shore Temple Mahabalipuram (Mammallapuram)\nMantapas and pillars\n\nThe mandapas and pillars of rock-cut temples and ratha temples bear their distinctive characteristics.\n\nBuddhist influence\n\nThe rock-cut temples of the Mamallapuram show the influence of Buddhist rock-cut caves. In ratha temples, some ratha follow the Buddhist Vihara model central square hall supported by a pillared roof. Some rates (Bhima, Sahadeva, Ganesh) follow the Chaitya model with an oblong shape bearing barrel roof and Chaitya Gabel.\n\nMonolithic Indian rock-cut architecture\n\nThe Ratha temples or seven pagodas which are carved out in granite rock are the finest example of Indian monolithic rock-cut architecture.\n\nFreestanding temples\n\nThe Pallava age shows the transition period from rock-cut to structural temples. The Ratha temples attempt to free themselves from the influence of rock-cut \u2018Chaitya\u2019 and \u2018Vihara\u2019. The structural detailing of the Ratha temples imitates wooden timber support and pilaster beams which are unnecessary in stone. This shows that they are not able to free totally from earlier wooden structured temples.\n\nGavaksha motif\n\nIt is a symbolic window throughout which deities are believed to be looked out. It is found in the Chaitya arches that consist of deities below the crown of the entablature.\n\nThe base of Dravidian Sikhara\n\nThe square ground story with open verandas in Dharmaraja Rathas forms the initiation of the pyramidal square of Dravidian tradition. Pallava temples in Kanchi are prototypes of Vimana to be developed by the Cholas in the later period.\n\nBase of Kalasa\n\nIn the pillars of the Mammalapuram group, above the Kumbha or melon capital ( a particular element in pillars that supports the below structure) a padma flares up to the palagai (abacus), and in Varaha mandapa, this flaring element is surrounded by thinnest abacus which later took the form of kalasa in Chola temples.\n\nYalis\n\nThe base of pillars of some structural temples bears the architectural motif of a lion later depicted by Cholas and this symbol of the lion became the royal insignia of Pallavas.\n\nKudus\n\nIn the facades of the walls, the Buddhist chaitya motif kudus is seen (later to be adopted by the Chalukya).\n\nDecoration and ornamentation\n\nThe walls and pillars of cave temples and structural temples decorated with architectural designs are seen.\n\nPillars\n\nThe pillars can be studied and understood as part of the three stages of development.\n\nFirst stage: This belongs to the pillars of rock-cut mandapa with 7 feet in height approximately. Here, brackets are seen towards the upper part of the pillar. Here, the pillar has a square shaft.\nSecond stage: Here, pillars were around 50 feet in height with a more ornate design. It shows the combination of shaft and capital. The lion motif is seen in the base of the shaft as well as in the capital.\nThird stage: Here, pillars come under the mandapa of ratha temples. In this case, malasthana, a motif with the bend of a pearl festoon is seen in the shaft. It rises to the pillar separated by an indentive structure called kumbha or melon capital above which a padma flares up to the palagai or abacus.\nRegional influence\n\nThe architectural design of one ratha in Mahabalipuram with a square hall along with a curvilinear, overhanging roof shows the influence of the traditional Bengali hut. It suggests that the origin of Dravidian shikhara has had its origin from the bamboo hut.\n\nBeginning of gopura\n\nThe architecture of Gopura begins with the Pallava dynasty as the initiation is seen in the shore temple of Mahabalipuram.\n\nRock cut relief\n\nThe greatest sculptural development of the age is cutting out the cleft in Mamallapuram between the two huge granite boulders as descend of Ganga with the presence of gods, demi-gods, kinnar, etc. It is variously known as penance of arjuna, kiratarjunia, etc.\n\nInfluence of Amaravati school of art\n\nIn the relief of the Mahabalipuram, the shape of gods in the form of clouds shows the influence of Amaravati art.\n\nEvidence of earliest portrait\n\nIn the Adivaraha cave, two portraits of a Pallava king accompanied by his son and queens are believed to be the earliest portrait sculpture after the Kushan images from Mathura.\n\nInfluence of Shaivism and Vaishnavishim\n\nIn the Varaha mandapa of Adivaraha cave, a panel showing Varaha lifting the earth goddesses is seen. The Brahma and Shiva are also sculpted around the main Varaha but in small size and disposition. In the panel of a Mahaballipuram cave, Durga as Korravai is depicted. Durga as Mahismardini is also a theme of the panel here.\n\nThe Descent of the Ganges /Arjuna\u2019s Penance\n\nThe huge sculpture of \u201cThe Descent of the Ganges\u201d also known as Arjuna\u2019s Penance was related to the system of water supply. There are clear traces of a carefully designed system of water supply from the Palar River to the ancient city. The large cliff, thirty yards long and twenty-three feet high, represents naga and naginis which symbolize water, adoring both sides of deities along with animals.\n\nAnimal sculpture\n\nThe animal sculpture, especially the relief of the monkey below the descent of the Ganga, is a noticeable feature of Pallava art.\n\nImportance of Shore Temple, Mahabalipuram\n\nShore Temple is a granite-made temple at Mahabalipuram built during the reign of Narsimhavarman. This group of temples is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is the oldest structural temple (in contrast with rock-cut temples) in India.\n\nIt is a beautiful 5 storyed temple, which is a combined complex of 3 shrines; 2 dedicated to Shiva and one to Vishnu.\u00a0The Shore Temple marks the culmination of the architectural efforts that began with the cave temples and monolithic rathas.\u00a07 Pagodas is a term associated with the Shore Temple of Mahabalipuram. It is said that 6 more temples were associated with it, all now submerged in water. The term \u2018ratha\u2019 corresponds to free standing temples.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Dravidian style of temple architecture began with the Pallava rule. It was a gradual evolution starting from the rock-cut- cave temples to monolithic rathas which finally culminated in structural temples.\n\nThe Pallava period was an age when architecture showed grandeur and beauty. The period is also known as the age of \u201cpoetry in stone\u201d. The magnificent temple of Kailashnath, which is carved out in stone, bears the testimony of the period. The monolithic seven Pagodas or rathas named after Pandavas are architectural wonders, though sea erosion has taken its toll.\n\nPossible questions for UPSC mains from this topic\nWhat does the huge sculpture \u2018Decent of Ganges\u2019 signify concerning the drainage system under the Pallava rule?\nThere was a mutual exchange of architectural styles between the Pallavas and Chalukyas. Explain.\nWhat does the term \u2018ratha\u2019 mean in Hindu temple architecture? Trace the evolution of Hindu temple architecture.\nThe mystery of the 7 pagodas is linked with the Pallava rule.

Pallavas (7th century \u2013 9th century) and Cholas (9th century -11th century) were the major kingdoms which epitomized Dravidian Architecture. Chalukyas (7th century -11th century) followed the Vesara style of architecture in the Karnataka region. Their style is also known as the Karnata Dravida style. Chalukya art was followed by Hoysala\u00a0art (13th century).\n\nDravidian Architecture: Pallavas and Cholas\n\nPallavas used bricks, lion motifs, dwarfed gopurams etc. Things changed at the hands of Cholas. They used stones instead of bricks. The walls were decorated with sculptures and paintings of deities, kings and queens (not lion motifs). Temples have enclosed decorative walls and entrances (Gopuram). They also have an audience hall known as Mandap. The deity room is known as Garbhgriha. The pyramid-like storey above the deity room is known as Vimana.\n\nChola Temple Architecture in detail\n\nThe Dravidian temple architecture started by the Pallavas got matured at the hand of the Cholas.

It was known for its contributions to art, culture, and architecture, as well as its political influence in different periods.\n\nIn the last article, we have seen the broad outline of temple architecture styles in India (Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara) and Chola architecture in particular. Under Dravidian architecture, we have also seen the comparison between Pallava and Chola architecture. In this post, let us see the Chalukyan architecture in detail.\n\nChalukyan architecture is a combination of Nagara and Dravida and hence a perfect example of Vesara architecture. The Chalukya temples stand in South India with its gorgeous beauty. Some features of Chalukya architecture are mentioned below.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFeatures of Chalukya temples\nDesign of the floor\nArchitectural design\nVesara style\nInfluence of Nagara Tradition\nInfluence of Dravida\u00a0tradition\nCombination of Nagara and Dravida style\nSpecial departure from Nagara and Dravida tradition\nDistinctive features\nCharacteristics of temple architecture of Chalukya\nQuestions to try :\nFeatures of Chalukya temples\n\nWhen we talk about Chalukyas, remember that there are at least two Chalukyas. Chalukayas of Badami (Vatapi) ruled Karnataka region around the 7th century AD. They were followed by Western Chalukyas (Kalyani Chalukyas) around the 11th century AD.\n\nThe Chalukyan temples are noticeable for three basic plans. They are :\n\nDesign of the floor\nProjection of architectural articulation\nSculpture.\nDesign of the floor\n\nIt indicates the plan of the salla, subsidiary shrines, their plan, design of pradakshina path.

The temple surfaces follow a distinctive architectural design with projections and recesses. The walls portray frequent projections and recesses that reflect a very magical beauty in the eyes of the viewers. The articulation of pillars and mantapas is beyond description.\n\nThe noticeable aspect is that though the ornamentation of Chalukya temples bears elements of Nagara and Dravidian tradition they have combined the elements in so prudent way that they become unique and distinctive features of their own.\n\nVesara style\n\nThe Vesara style also called the Chalukyan type possessed the Dravidian vimana and the Nagara-type faceted walls.\n\nKey features of the Vesara architectural style include:\n\nBlend of Dravidian and Nagara Styles: The Vesara style represents a harmonious amalgamation of the Dravidian architectural traditions of South India and the Nagara architectural traditions of North India. This fusion is most evident in the temples built during this period.\nShikhara and Vimana: Vesara temples typically feature a combination of both Dravidian shikhara (tower) and Nagara vimana (temple spire) styles. The shikhara is pyramidal, similar to the North Indian style, while the vimana has a Dravidian-like bulbous or multi-tiered structure.\nMandapa: These temples often have a large hall or mandapa with pillars and intricate sculptural details. The mandapa serves as a gathering space for devotees and often has elaborate decorative elements.\nCarved Pillars: Vesara temples are known for their intricately carved pillars, featuring various mythological and religious motifs. These pillars are both functional and decorative.\nDravida-Nagara Vimana: The vesara vimana typically has a Dravida-style base (square or rectangular) and a Nagara-style superstructure. This combination results in a distinctive appearance.\nDecorative Elements: The Vesara style is known for its rich sculptural adornments, including depictions of deities, celestial beings, and scenes from Hindu mythology. These carvings are found on temple walls, pillars, and doorways.\nRegional Variations: While Vesara architecture is often associated with the Deccan region, there are regional variations within the style due to the different dynasties that patronized it, such as the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, and Hoysalas. Each dynasty contributed its unique characteristics to Vesara architecture.\nProminent Temples: Some famous examples of Vesara-style temples include the Kailasanatha Temple at Ellora, the Virupaksha Temple at Pattadakal, and the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu.\nInfluence of Nagara Tradition\nThe plan of the shrine, subsidiary shrine, and panchayatan style bears similarity to Nagara school.\nThe plan of the vestibule joining the sanctum to the mandapa bears resemblance to Orissan temples.\nMost of the temple pillars in the Karnataka region bear similarities to the sekhari and bhumija types of pillars in northern India.\nThe stepped diamond plan, a plan of design arrangement as seen in Chalukya temples is from the northern region.\nMost of the temples in Kalyani portray Nagara articulation projecting stepped diamond or stellate plan.\nInfluence of Dravida\u00a0tradition\n\nThe Dravida influence is mainly visible in the vimana of the Chalukya temples in the first part of the Chalukya rule.\n\nCombination of Nagara and Dravida style\nVesara sikhar or Kadamba sikhara:\u00a0It is a shikhara of Chalukya temple showing northern shikhara shikhara and southern vimana features.\nOrnamentation: Miniature decorative towers and ornamentation of walls in Chalukya temples show a combination of both Nagara and Dravida styles.\n\nRead: Kadamba Dynasty\n\nSpecial departure from Nagara and Dravida tradition\n\nIn the case of the entrance hall to the shrine, Chalukya temple bears special uniqueness. It has two or more two entrances while\n\nThere is a small closed mantapa to the shrine in Nagara temples.\nThere is an enlarged, open, and closed mantapa in Dravida temples.\nDistinctive features\n\nOrnamentation: In the case of ornamentation of temple walls and pillars, the Chalukyan temple shows indigenous quality.\n\nTransformation of Dravida tower: The Chalukyan builders modified the Dravida towers by minimizing the height of each story and arranging them in descending order of height from base to top with much ornamentation in each story.\n\nTransformation of Nagara Tower: Instead of an inclined storey modification is seen in the vertical shape of the tower.\n\nTwo special features of Chalukya temples \u2013 Mantapa and Pillers :\u00a0\n\nMantapa: The mandapa has two types of roof \u2013 domical ceilings (the dome-like ceilings standing on four pillars are very attractive) or \u00a0Square ceilings (these are vigorously ornamented with mythological pictures).\n\nPillars: As mentioned earlier, the miniature decorative pillars of Chalukya temples stand with their own artistic value.\n\nCharacteristics of temple architecture of Chalukya\nThe pillars of the Chalukya temple are monolithic shafts whose height determines the height of the mandapa and temples.\nChalukya architects did not use mortar. It allows ventilation of light to the innermost part of the temples.\nThe vestibules were ornamented with artificial lights which eliminated darkness as well as added some kind of mystic feeling.\nThe doorway panels of Chalukya temples are highly decorated and consist of pilasters, molded lintel, and cornice tops.\nArabesque is a Muslim art design bearing linear artistic decoration with patterns of flowers, leaves, branches, or twisted branches.

Kuchipudi are themes related to Vaishnavism, Lord Krishna, Rukmini, Satyabhama and other myths. Kuchipudi also holds certain specialties of Bharatnatyam and Odissi as well.\n\nKuchipudi vs Bharatanatyam\nBharatnatyam costume has three fans of dissimilar lengths. While Kuchipudi dress has only one frill/fan lengthier than the lengthiest fan in the former.\nIn Bharatnatyam, there is no side Pallu but in Kuchipudi separate pallu is stitched seen on the left side.\nTwo buns are used in Kuchipudi while only one in Bharatnatyam.\nThe repertoire\u00a0of Kuchipudi\nThe repertoire\u00a0of Kuchipudi is similar to that of Bharatanatyam:\nKuchipudi has a specialty called- \u2018Tarangam\u2019 in which the dancer performs on the top of the brass plates.\nAnd sometimes balances some pot on the head.

Movements in Kathakali are influenced by ancient martial arts and athletic tradition. It is basically a Dance-Drama.\u00a0Kathakali was traditionally a male-dominated dance and now females are too welcomed in this dance form. Kathakali is also famous for its huge elaborate costumes, amazing make-up style, face masks, and ornaments.\n\nUnlike other Classical Dances, Kathakali art form developed in the courts and theaters of Hindu principalities. The traditional performances were used to be as long from Dusk to dawn. Modern day presentations are short as per the time limit of the program. The Kerala Kalamandalam is the main center for Kathakali Artists.\u00a0Kathakali has similarities with other dance forms like that of the Japanese \u2018 Noh\u2019 and \u2018Kabuki\u2019 dance forms have similarities with Kathakali.\n\nThe main themes used in Kathakali\nMythological themes include Ramayan, Mahabharat, Bhagvat Purana, etc.\nAlso modern day Kathakali dancers present stories and plays of Shakespeare.\nThe makeup for Kathakali\nAccording to the role of the\u00a0dancer,\u00a0his face is colored/painted.\nThe colors are made in rice paste with vegetable colors and applied on the face.\nThe Green for Noble characters.\nTati (Red) for evil like Ravana.\nKari (black) for hunters and monsters.\nYellow for women etc.\nThe famous artists of Kathakali\nKalamandalam Krishna Prasad.\nKalamandalam Kesavan Namboodiri.\nKalamandalam Gopi etc.\nMohiniattam\n\nAnother graceful Classical Dance of Kerala, Mohiniattam is Lasya inspired dance with soft, calm and gentle movements.

The Manipuri dance form is categorized as Tandav or Lasya.\n\nThe beautifully soft and graceful dance form, Manipuri has significant movements of hands and upper body. A curvy body structure with a pleasant smile, decorative, shiny costumes, and ornaments, Manipuri is indeed a mesmerizing dance form.

Sattriya was recognized in 2000 as Classical Dance by Sangeet Natak Akademi. It is influenced by Vaishnavism and the modern form of Sattriya is attributed to the 15th century Bhakti Movement Scholar and Saint Srimanta Sankaradev. Since 15th Century, Sattriya grew as a part of Vaishnav Bhakti Movement in Hindu Monasteries called \u2018Sattra\u2019. Sattras are the dance community halls (namghar) of monastery temples.

        "[CONTENT]": "The study of coinage in history is called numismatics. This article is an attempt to capture the significant evolutionary changes the ancient Indian coinage experienced.\n\nThe beginning of ancient Indian coinage can be traced between the 1st millennium BCE to the 6th Century BCE. This stage comprised coins that were made of copper and silver.\n\nThe coins found in ancient Indian history were mainly stamped bars of metal. The metal stamped bars were inspired by the currency that was in circulation during the Janpadas in the early historical phase and evolved further with the emergence of different dynasties.\n\nAlso read: Gold monetization scheme\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPrehistoric and Bronze Age\nCoins in the Vedic Period\nCoinage during Janapadas\nPunch-marked coins\nCoinage and the Mauryas\nCoinage by the Indo-Greeks\nThe Kushana type coins\nCoinage by the Imperial Guptas\nPost Gupta Coinage\nCoinage by the Imperial Cholas\nComparison of Coin used in India\nSignificance of numismatics in history\nQuestions related to the topic asked in the UPSC Civil Services Examination:\nPrehistoric and Bronze Age\n\nIn the Indian context, no significant evidence is found to conclude that people in Stone age used currency or they conducted exchange in barter.\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilization seems to have conducted an extensive trade on a wide network, but it was predominantly conducted around the barter system. However, the Harappans also used metals like silver of fixed weight for trade and mercantile activities.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso read: Ambergris: The Floating Gold\n\nCoins in the Vedic Period\n\nThe Rigveda has references to nishka (gold) and nishka greeva (ornaments of gold) but it is not sure if these could be understood as coins.\n\nHowever, the later Vedic texts had references to nishka, suvarna, shatamana, and pada. But scholars are of the opinion that these terms do not indicate a wide circulation of conventional coins.\n\nCoinage during Janapadas\n\nThe most definite literary and archaeological evidence that suggests the usage of coins in the subcontinent, dates around 6th-5th Century BCE. It was in the context of the emergence of states, urbanisation, and rising trade activities that the Buddhist texts and Panini\u2019s Ashtadhyayi refer to terms like kahapana/karshapana, nikkha/nishka, shatamana, pada, vimshatika, trinshatika, and suvanna/suvarna.\n\nIt is interesting to note the basic unit of the weight of the Indian coins was the red and black seed of gunja berry (Abrus precatorius).\n\nIn South India, the standard weight of the coins was ascertained by calculating the relationship between the weight of two kinds of beans- the manjadi (Odenthera pavonia) and Kalanju (Caesalpinia bonduc).\n\nRead:\u00a0Mahajanapadas\n\nPunch-marked coins\n\nThe most conventional system of coinage emerged with the circulation of punch-marked coins, that were mostly made of silver, and sometimes even copper. They were sometimes square, or round but mostly rectangular in shape.\n\nThe symbols on these were hammered using punches and dies. That is why we know them as punch-marked coins.\n\nA standard punch-marked coin often weighed around 32 rattis or about 52 grains (1 grain = 64.79 mg).\n\nPunch marked coins are found across the subcontinent and were popular till the early centuries CE.\n\nThe Punch marked coin series can be further divided into four categories: The Taxila-Gandhara type, the Kosala type, the Avanti type, and the Magadhan type.\n\nWith the expansion of the Magadhan Empire, the coins that belonged to the Magadhan category replaced the other three types. It must be noted that these coins do not have any legends inscribed on them which could convey the details of the kingdom.\n\nCoins of Kuru Janapada\nCoins of Magadha Janapada\nCoinage and the Mauryas\n\nThe Mauryan Empire used the punch-marked coins but with royal standard to make sure of their authenticity.\n\nThe liberty to use two different metals for coins was granted, and hence coins in silver and copper were very popular.\n\nHoards mostly of Mauryan coins\nCoinage by the Indo-Greeks\n\nThe next prominent range of coins that were issued belongs to 2nd/1st century BCE by the Indo-Greeks. The Indo-Greek system of coinage becomes significant because the minting was executed in a more refined manner.\n\nThe coins were mostly made of silver, usually round, with exceptions to few rectangular or circular) bore the name of the issuing ruler along with depicting legends.\n\nFor example, the coins of Menander and Strabo I show them passing through different stages of life, suggesting their long reigns.\n\nThe languages on these coins was Prakrit, inscribed mostly in Kharoshthi script.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCoin from the reign of Menander I, Obverse: Menander throwing a spear, Reverse Athena with the thunderbolt, Legend written: \u201cOf King Menander, the Saviour\u201d.\nThe Kushana type coins\n\nThe Kushanas (1st-4th Centuries CE) were the first dynasty in the subcontinent that issued a large number of gold coins. The lower denomination was usually found in copper coins.\n\nThe coins usually bore the figure, name, and title of the ruler on the obverse and the deities on the reverse. The legends are either entirely in Greek, or in some cases in Kharoshthi on the reverse.\n\nCoin of Kanishka in Greek script, with an illustration of the Buddha on the reverse\nCoinage by the Imperial Guptas\n\nThe Imperial Guptas issued well-minted and well-executed gold coins, die struck with various impressive legends in Sanskrit. These coins, also known as dinaras, were mostly found in North India.\n\nThe obverse has the kings in various poses, mostly in martial mood, but sometimes even in artistic calibre.\n\nCoins have also shown rulers like Samudragupta and Kumaragupta playing Vina.\n\nThe Gupta coins were issued in gold in large numbers and have been credited to their fine aesthetic appeal. However, the purity of gold saw a decline during the later Guptas.\n\nGold coins of Chandragupta II of Gupta Empire, 400 CE\nPost Gupta Coinage\n\nThe dynasties like the Gurjaras, Pratiharas, Chalukyas, Paramaras, and the Palas from circa 530 CE to 1202 CE can be put under a broad category of Indo-Sassanian styled coinage.\n\nThe main features of these coins included the bust of the ruling sovereign in a simplified geometric style on the obverse and a motif like a fire altar on the reverse.\n\nCoinage by the Imperial Cholas\n\nThe coinage of the imperial Cholas bore semblance to the South Indian dynastic coins. The Chola coins exhibited a tiger crest. They also suggested political developments.\n\nThe emblems like fish and bow which belonged to the Pandyas and Cheras suggested a political conquest of these political powers, and also the idea of co-existence.\n\nComparison of Coin used in India\nS.No.\n\t\nCoin Type\n\t\nMetal\n\t\nDetails inscribed\n\t\nScript and language\n\n\n1.\n\t\nPunch-marked coins\n\t\nMostly silver, sometimes copper\n\t\nMostly geometrical shapes, plants, animals, and geographical features\n\t\nNone\n\n\n2.\n\t\nIndo Greek type\n\t\nMostly silver\n\t\nName of the issuing ruler with depicting legends\n\t\nThe language was Prakrit, mostly in Kharoshthi script\n\n\n3.\n\t\nKushana type\n\t\nMostly gold, but also silver and rarely copper\n\t\nFigure, name, and title of the ruler on obverse, and the deities on the reverse\n\t\nLegends in Greek, inscribed in Kharoshthi script\n\n\n4.\n\t\nGupta coinage\n\t\nMostly gold coins were issued\n\t\nA figure of the ruler, with a deity\n\t\nBrahmi\n\n\n5.\n\t\nChola coins\n\t\nGold, silver and copper\n\t\nLegends of the rulers\n\t\nNagari script\n\n\n6.\n\t\nPost Gupta\n\t\nDecline in gold, mostly silver and copper\n\t\nNames of the rulers, and a motif\n\t\nVaried with dynasties.\n\nTable: A brief overview of the numismatic history of early India\n\nSignificance of numismatics in history\n\nCoins are an important source of history, as they suggest important historical processes.\u00a0 Not only the monetary situation, but broader questions related to economy and polity can be answered through numismatics.\n\nThe wide distribution of Kushana coins suggests trading activities, and the presence of ship motifs on Satvahana coinage reflects the importance of maritime trade. The inscribed figures of rulers, deities and legends give us an insight into social and political aspects of various kingdoms.\n\nIt must be noted that dates are seen very rarely on early Indian coins. Barring western Kshatrapa coins which give dates in the Shaka era and some Gupta silver coins which give the regnal years of kings, coins in early India are mostly devoid of dates. Dated or undated, coins found in archaeological excavations often help date the layers of time. An example is a site of Sonkh near Mathura, where the excavated levels were categorised into eight periods on the basis of coin finds.\n\nWith regard to the later development in coinage, the numismatic history of later ancient and the early medieval period saw a decline in trade and the feudal order marked stressed urban centres, and as a result, even though the circulation of coins did not stop, their purity and aesthetic quality saw degradation at many levels.\n\nSources:\n\nCribb, Joe, Investigating the introduction of coinage in India- a review of recent research, Journal of the Numismatic Society of India xlv (Varanasi 1983), pp.95-101. pp. 85\u201386.\nGupta, Parmanand, Geography from Ancient Indian Coins & Seals, Concept Publishing Company, 1989, p. 158\nBrown, C.J.

This proclamation allowed members of lower caste communities to enter Hindu temples, a revolutionary step towards social reform and equality in a society deeply stratified by caste.\nEducational Reforms: The state invested in education, establishing schools and colleges and making education accessible to a broader segment of the population, including girls and members of lower castes. The focus on education aimed to eradicate illiteracy and promote social upliftment.\nHealthcare Initiatives: Efforts were also made to improve public health services. Hospitals and dispensaries were established, and measures were taken to combat and control diseases such as smallpox.\nInfrastructure Development: Travancore saw significant infrastructure development, including the construction of roads, bridges, and irrigation projects, which facilitated better connectivity and agricultural productivity.\n\nTravancore maintained a subsidiary alliance with the British Raj but enjoyed a considerable degree of autonomy compared to other princely states.\n\nThe rulers of Travancore navigated their diplomatic relations with the British skillfully, ensuring the state\u2019s interests were protected while adapting to the changing political landscape of India.\n\nVaikom satyagraha\n\nThe movement began in 1924 in Vaikom, a small town in the state of Kerala.\n\nThe Vaikom Mahadeva Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, was surrounded by roads that were not accessible to lower-caste Hindus, which was a clear manifestation of the prevailing caste-based discrimination.\nBack then, the people of the oppressed classes especially the Ezhavas, were prohibited from walking on the four roads surrounding the Vaikom Mahadeva temple.\nSpearheaded by Congress leader T.K. Madhavan, who himself was an Ezhava, an agitation was launched against this social injustice.\nThe denial of access to roads around temples and other public facilities to certain sections of society was a widespread practice in Kerala and other parts of India.\n\nInitiation:\n\nThe Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, inspired by the principles of non-violent civil disobedience advocated by Mahatma Gandhi, initiated the satyagraha.\nThe movement was led by prominent leaders like K. Kelappan, T.K. Madhavan, and K.P. Kesava Menon, among others.\nThe protesters employed non-violent methods, such as picketing the roads leading to the temple and organizing peaceful marches and gatherings, demanding the right for all Hindus, regardless of caste, to use the roads around the temple.\nSree Narayana Guru also extended his support and cooperation to the Vaikom Satyagraha. Guru was against the caste system and orthodox discrimination prevalent in Hindu society. He had given Vellore Mutt near Vaikom to set up the head office for the Satyagrahis.\n\nThe movement gained national attention, and Mahatma Gandhi himself visited Vaikom in 1925 to support the cause.\n\nHis involvement brought significant publicity and support to the movement from across India.\nAfter intense negotiations and under pressure from the national movement and public opinion, the Travancore government finally agreed to open the roads around the temple to lower-caste Hindus in 1925.\nHowever, the temple itself remained inaccessible to them until the Temple Entry Proclamation was issued by the Maharaja of Travancore in 1936.\nImpact and Legacy\nAgainst Caste Discrimination: The Vaikom Satyagraha is heralded as a crucial battle against caste discrimination in India. It set a precedent for future movements and was a stepping stone toward the Temple Entry Movement, which culminated in the Temple Entry Proclamation, allowing lower caste individuals to enter Hindu temples.\nInspiration for Future Movements: The success of the Vaikom Satyagraha inspired several other similar movements across Kerala and other parts of India, contributing significantly to the social reform and anti-caste movements.\nIntegration into the Freedom Movement: The movement also demonstrated the potential of integrating social reform with the broader Indian independence movement, showing how the struggle against colonial rule could also encompass a fight against social injustices.\nConclusion\n\nVaikom Satyagraha remains a pivotal moment in the history of social reform in India, symbolizing the power of non-violent resistance against deeply entrenched social inequalities and inspiring future generations to continue the fight for equality and justice.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ. Since the decade of the 1920s, the national movement acquired various ideological strands and thereby expanded its social base. Discuss.

These invasions led to internal conflicts and weakened the kingdom.\n\nBritish Annexation: The British East India Company became involved in the conflicts, and the Ahom Kingdom eventually came under British control. The Treaty of Yandabo in 1826 marked the formal annexation of Assam by the British.\n\nConclusion\n\nLachit Borphukan\u2019s legacy is not only significant for Assam but also serves as a source of inspiration for those who value courage, leadership, and the defense of one\u2019s homeland.

This collection helped Tagore win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913,\n\nHistory of the Arya Samaj\n\nLala Lajpat Rai joined the Arya Samaj in Lahore after being inspired by Swami Dayananda Saraswati.

It includes his thoughts on liberty and freedom as well as his personal experiences with India\u2019s independence.\n\nThe book describes the events of the Indian Independence struggle in the style of an autobiographical story. The book deftly and profoundly traces the happenings that eventually resulted in the split. According to the book, politics, not religion, was more to blame for the divide. Additionally, it claims that after gaining independence, India fell short of realizing its full potential. In addition to discussing political hypocrisy, the book illustrates the mindsets of the author\u2019s colleagues at the time, including Nehru, Gandhi, and Subhash Chandra Bose.\n\nThe Discovery of India\n\nWhen Jawaharlal Nehru was imprisoned at Ahmednagar Fort for his involvement in the Quit India Movement, he published the book \u201cThe Discovery of India\u201d (1942 \u2013 1946). The book was written by Nehru during his four years of solitary confinement in prison and serves as a tribute to his beloved nation and its rich culture.\n\nThe book began with an extensive discussion of ancient texts including the Vedas, Upanishads, and textbooks, and it ended with the British Raj. The television series and the book both present a broad view of Indian history, culture, and philosophy. The book is regarded as among the best works in Indian history ever written.\n\nAn Indian Pilgrim\n\n\u201cAn Indian Pilgrim,\u201d which Netaji wrote around the end of 1937 while traveling through Europe after being named the Rashtrapati of Bharatbarsha, recounts Netaji\u2019s life from his infancy until he departs from the Indian Civil Service. In this autobiography, the author gives a truthful and sincere account of his early years, his schooling in Cuttack with a group of cousins and relatives, his intellectual formative years as a promising student at Presidency College in Calcutta, his search for spiritual enlightenment, and his experiences as a student at the prestigious Cambridge University.\n\nThe story of how his life\u2019s motivations\u2014a spirit of service, selflessness, and zeal for national liberation\u2014grew may be found in the book.\u00a0 The autobiography also sheds a great deal of light on Netaji\u2019s unwavering spirit in the Indian freedom movement.\n\nHistory of the Indian National Congress\n\nThe book, written by B Pattabhi Sitaramayya, spans two volumes and chronicles the development of the Indian National Congress from 1885 to 1935. According to the author, the Indian National Congress is more than just an organization; it is an organism and an individual because it was founded in 1885 with a certain goal in mind. For those who want to carefully examine what happened during the formation, growth, and maintenance of the Indian National Congress, this book is essential.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe development of the printing press in Serampore, Bengal, under the sponsorship of an Englishman named William Carey, as well as the emergence of literary prose in all contemporary Indian languages, were the two most major literary events that changed literature (1761-1834). The emergence of newspapers and magazines in Indian languages between 1800 and 1850 was crucial for the growth of prose. Bengali journalism was set on its course by the Serampore missionaries. Modern Indian history books are becoming a potent medium at the same time as modernization brought about a certain kind of transformation.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas\u00a0"

        "[META]": "Last updated on April 8, 2024 by ClearIAS Team",
        "[CONTENT]": "Gothic architecture is a style of architecture that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. It evolved from the Romanesque architectural style and was succeeded by the Renaissance architecture. Read here to learn all about it.\n\nGothic architecture was named for the Goths, a nomadic Germanic group that fought against Roman rule in the late 300s and early 400s.\n\nGothic designs were created to bring more sunlight into spaces, mainly churches, and led to the design and construction of some of the world\u2019s most iconic buildings.\n\nGothic architecture reached its peak in the 12th to 16th centuries, with regional variations across Europe. It remains a significant and influential architectural style, particularly in the design of cathedrals and churches.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGothic Architecture: Features\nNeo-gothic style\nFamous gothic architecture\nIndo-Gothic Architecture\nGothic Architecture: Features\n\nPointed Arches: One of the defining features of Gothic architecture is the use of pointed arches. Unlike the rounded arches of Romanesque architecture, the pointed arches of Gothic buildings give them a vertical emphasis and contribute to a sense of height.\nRibbed Vaults: Gothic cathedrals often feature ribbed vaults, where the intersection of pointed arches creates a rib-like pattern across the ceiling. This architectural element not only adds structural support but also enhances the visual appeal of the interior.\nFlying Buttresses: External buttresses, known as flying buttresses, were a crucial innovation in Gothic architecture. These arched supports extend from the exterior of a building to a pier, counteracting the outward thrust of the vaults and allowing for taller, more open interior spaces.\nGothic Arches: In addition to pointed arches, Gothic architecture is characterized by various arch forms, such as ogee arches and lancet arches. These arches contribute to the verticality and gracefulness of Gothic structures.\nRose Windows: Gothic cathedrals often feature intricate rose windows, which are large circular windows with radiating tracery. These windows are located at the ends of transepts or above entrances and are known for their detailed stained glass.\nGargoyles and Grotesques: Decorative stone carvings of grotesque figures, including gargoyles, are common in Gothic architecture. Gargoyles serve both aesthetic and functional purposes, acting as water spouts to direct rain away from the building.\nTall and Slender Towers: Gothic cathedrals are known for their tall and slender towers that reach towards the heavens. These towers often feature spires, adding to the vertical emphasis of the architecture.\nTracery: Tracery is the ornamental stonework that forms the patterns in the upper part of a Gothic window. It can be simple and geometric or intricate and flowing, depending on the period and regional style.\nVaulting Systems: Gothic architecture employed various types of vaulting systems, including quadripartite and sexpartite vaults. These systems distributed the weight of the roof and allowed for larger, more open interiors.\nEmphasis on Light: Gothic cathedrals sought to maximize the use of natural light. The large windows with stained glass not only allowed light to enter the building but also created a visual spectacle, with the play of colored light enhancing the spiritual experience.\nHeight and Verticality: The vertical emphasis in Gothic architecture is intended to draw the viewer\u2019s gaze upward, symbolizing a spiritual ascent. This emphasis on height is achieved through pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and soaring towers.\nNeo-gothic style\n\nNeo-Gothic architecture, also known as Gothic Revival, is a style that emerged in the 18th century as a revival of the original Gothic architecture that characterized the medieval period. The Neo-Gothic style gained popularity during the 19th and early 20th centuries and was a reaction against the perceived excesses of the preceding Rococo and Neoclassical styles.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNeo-Gothic architecture experienced a significant revival during the Victorian and Edwardian eras in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This period saw the construction of numerous Gothic Revival structures, including the restoration of medieval cathedrals and the creation of new buildings in the Gothic style.\n\nThese structures tended to be bigger than the old Gothic style of buildings.\n\nFamous gothic architecture\n\nProminent examples of Gothic architecture include:\n\nNotre-Dame Cathedral in Paris\nChartres Cathedral in France\nWestminster Abbey in London\nPalace of Westminster \u2013 Seat of the British parliament\nThe Cologne Cathedral, Germany\nThe Cathedral Church of Milan, the largest church in Italy\nCanterbury Cathedral, England\nSalisbury Cathedral \u2013 The home of the Magna Carta\nThe Black Church, Romania\nLeuven Town Hall, Belgium\nSophia Cathedral, Northern Cyprus, is now a Mosque\nSaint Vitus Cathedral \u2013 The largest cathedral in Prague\nMir Castle, Belarus\nIndo-Gothic Architecture\n\n\u201cIndo-Gothic architecture\u201d typically refers to a style of architecture that emerged in British India during the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThis architectural style combined elements of traditional Indian architecture with Gothic Revival features, which were popular in Europe during the same period.\n\nThe term is sometimes used to describe buildings that exhibit a fusion of Western and Indian architectural elements, particularly in the context of colonial structures.\n\nGothic Revival Elements: The Indo-Gothic style incorporates Gothic Revival features, which include pointed arches, ribbed vaults, spires, and tracery. These elements were inspired by medieval Gothic architecture in Europe, especially the cathedrals and churches of the Middle Ages.\nPointed Arches: Similar to traditional Gothic architecture, Indo-Gothic structures often feature pointed arches. These arches may be used in doorways, windows, and arcades, creating a distinctive visual style.\nTracery and Ornamentation: Tracery, which is ornamental stone or woodwork that forms patterns in windows and openings, is a characteristic feature of both Gothic and Indo-Gothic architecture. Elaborate carvings and decorative elements are often present, reflecting a fusion of Western and Indian artistic traditions.\nButtresses and Towers: Some buildings in the Indo-Gothic style include external buttresses and tall towers, reminiscent of Gothic structures. These architectural elements contribute to the verticality and grandeur of the buildings.\nBlend with Indian Elements: Indo-Gothic architecture often incorporates traditional Indian architectural elements and motifs, such as domes, chhatris (small ornamental pavilions), jali (latticework), and minarets. This blending of Western and Indian styles reflects the cultural and architectural syncretism of the time.\nUse in Colonial Period: The Indo-Gothic style gained prominence during the British colonial period in India, as European architects sought to adapt Western architectural forms to the Indian context. The style was particularly employed for civic and public buildings, including government offices, universities, and churches.\n\nExamples of Indo-Gothic Architecture\n\nChhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus): Located in Mumbai, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is an iconic railway station that exhibits Indo-Gothic features.\nXavier\u2019s College, Mumbai: This educational institution is an example of Indo-Gothic architecture, featuring pointed arches and decorative elements.\nPaul\u2019s Cathedral, Kolkata: A prominent Anglican cathedral, it incorporates Gothic Revival elements and traditional Indian architectural features.\nSt.Philomena Church, Mysuru: It was built in neo-gothic style in 1840, and gained popularity during the reign of Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV of Mysore.\n\nMany Indo-Gothic buildings continue to stand as landmarks in Indian cities, reflecting the historical and architectural legacy of the colonial period. Efforts are made to preserve and restore these structures as part of India\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nColonial Architecture\nIndo-Islamic architecture\nQutb Shahi architecture\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It was installed at Marina Beach, Chennai, on the eve of the Republic Day in 1959. It shows four men trying to move a rock, rendering the importance and contribution of human labor in nation-building. Unconquerable men are wrestling with nature, doggedly, indeterminately, and powerfully. It is an image of labor against the elements of nature, a well-known romantic subject of the nineteenth century.\n\nSanthal family\n\nThis is an open-air large-scale sculpture created by Ramkinker Baij in 1937. It is made out of metal armature and cement mixed with pebbles, and placed in the compound of Kala Bhavana, Shantiniketan, India\u2019s first national art school. It shows a scene of a Santhal man, carrying his children in a double basket joined by a pole, and his wife and dog walking alongside.

However, he gives it a monumental status.\n\nCries unheard\n\nThis is a sculpture in bronze made by Amarnath Sahgal in 1958. Although the artist only uses abstraction, in which three figures are stick-like and shown in flat rhythmical planes, it is easy to understand them as a family\u2014husband, wife, and child. They are shown flinging their arms above and crying out for help in vain. Through the medium of sculpture, their helplessness expressed by the hand gesture is turned into a permanent shape.\n\nGanesha\n\nThis sculpture in oxidized copper made by P. V. Janakiram in 1970 is in the collection of NGMA, Delhi. He used sheets of copper to create pictorial sculptures as free-standing forms and ornamented their surface with linear elements. Metal sheets are beaten into concave planes on which are welded linear details. These linear elements work as facial features and decorative motifs to suggest religious icons, inviting intimate contemplation. The ancient temple sculpture of South India influences Janakiram.\n\nVanshri (Goddess of Woods)\n\nThis artwork was created by Mrinalini Mukherjee in 1994. She uses an unusual material to make this sculpture. She uses hemp fibre, a medium that she experimented with from the early 1970s. Going by the intricate way, she has knotted together and woven a complex shape out of jute fiber. It seems to be the result of years of handling the new material. For many years, her works of this kind were dismissed as craft.\nConclusion\n\nThe history of modern Indian sculpture is diverse, reflecting the dynamic evolution of artistic expression in response to changing social, political, and cultural contexts. It\u2019s worth exploring individual artists and their contributions to gain a deeper understanding of this rich and multifaceted history.\n\nThe field of modern Indian sculpture is vast and dynamic, with many talented artists contributing to its evolution.

The war disrupted normal trade patterns and led to a scarcity of food supplies.\n\nThe primary cause of the famine was a series of crop failures in Bengal, particularly of rice, which was the staple food of the region.\n\nThese crop failures were attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather conditions, such as a cyclone and excessive rainfall, and the Japanese occupation of Burma (present-day Myanmar), which disrupted rice imports into Bengal.\nPrice Inflation: As food became scarcer due to crop failures, the prices of essential food items, especially rice, rose significantly. This made it increasingly difficult for the poor and vulnerable populations to afford basic sustenance.\nHoarding and Black Market: Speculation, hoarding, and the emergence of a black market exacerbated the food crisis. Some traders and businesses sought to profit from the shortage, driving up prices and making food even scarcer for the general population.\n\nThe British colonial administration\u2019s response to the famine was widely criticized.\n\nWhile they did take some measures to alleviate the crisis, such as importing rice and distributing relief, these efforts were often insufficient and ineffective.\nThere were also policies in place, such as grain requisitioning, that were intended to support the war effort but exacerbated the food shortage in Bengal.\nThe famine led to a significant loss of life. Estimates of the death toll vary widely, but it is generally believed that several million people perished as a result of the famine and its related effects, such as disease and malnutrition. The most vulnerable groups, including the poor and marginalized, suffered the most.\n\nThe Bengal Famine had a profound impact on the political landscape in India. It heightened anti-colonial sentiments and contributed to a growing demand for independence from British rule. Many Indians viewed the British response to the famine as inadequate and insensitive.\n\nThe Bengal Famine of 1943 remains a highly contentious and debated historical event. While it was influenced by natural factors, it is also seen as a result of failed policies and a lack of proper governance by the British authorities. It serves as a symbol of the broader issues related to colonialism, food security, and governance in the context of wartime crises.\n\nCauses of Famine\nNatural Factors: Droughts, floods, crop failures, and other natural disasters were common triggers for famines in agrarian India.\nEconomic Policies: The British colonial economic policies, including the promotion of cash crops like indigo and opium, and the export of food grains to Britain, sometimes exacerbated food shortages.\nLand Revenue System: The British introduced a land revenue system that imposed a heavy tax burden on Indian peasants. This led to land overexploitation and indebtedness, making them vulnerable to crop failures.\n\nOther causes which aggravated the intensity of the famines were:\n\nInadequate Relief: The British colonial government\u2019s response to famines was often criticized for being inadequate.\nRelief measures were introduced, but they were often delayed and insufficient in scale. Many people suffering from famine received little or no assistance.\nFood Grain Export: During some famines, the British authorities continued to export food grains from India to Britain, exacerbating food scarcity in the affected regions.\nThe economic interests of British merchants and the colonial administration often took precedence over the welfare of the Indian population.\nImpact\n\nSocial Impact: Famine led to widespread suffering, loss of life, and displacement.\n\nStarvation, malnutrition, and diseases associated with famine caused high mortality rates.\nSocial systems were disrupted, and large-scale migrations occurred as people sought food and relief.\n\nEconomic Impact: Famine contributed to the impoverishment of Indian agriculture and the decline of traditional industries. The consequences of famines lingered for years after the food shortages had subsided.\n\nPolitical Consequences: Famines and the colonial government\u2019s response to them played a role in fostering political awareness and activism. Indian leaders and reformers began to demand changes in the administration and greater self-governance.\n\nFamine Codes: In the late 19th century, the colonial government introduced Famine Codes that outlined procedures for relief during food shortages. While these codes improved the administration of relief during some famines, they could not prevent the recurrence of food shortages.\n\nConclusion\n\nFamines in colonial India are often seen as a dark chapter in the history of British colonial rule, marked by human suffering and economic exploitation. They played a role in shaping political and social movements that ultimately contributed to the struggle for India\u2019s independence.\n\nAfter gaining independence in 1947, India implemented policies and initiatives to mitigate the impact of famines, such as the Green Revolution, which improved agricultural productivity and food security.\n\nPrevious year question\n\nQ. Why was there a sudden spurt in famines in colonial India since the mid-18th century? Give reasons. (Answer in 150 words) 10 marks [GS paper 1, 2022]\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

        "[CONTENT]": "Civil service reforms during the British colonial period in India were implemented with the aim of establishing a professional and efficient administrative system that would serve the interests of the British Empire. Read here to learn the history of civil services in India.\n\nThe East India Company established a civil service system in India to benefit its commercial concerns. It eventually developed into a well-organized system to handle the administrative affairs of India\u2019s newly acquired territories.\n\nIn fact, the phrase \u201ccivil service\u201d was originally used to distinguish between the Company\u2019s employees working in the military and naval services from those working in commercial matters. The authority and responsibilities of civil servants grew over time.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of Civil Services in India\nCivil Service Reforms during British Period\nCivil Service Reforms under Lord Macaulay\nAitchison Committee on Public Services, 1886\nMontague-Chelmsford Reforms\nRoyal Commission on the Superior Civil Services in India- Lee Commission, 1923\nCivil Service Reforms during British- 1940s\nConclusion\nHistory of Civil Services in India\n\nIts beginnings can be traced back to ancient India\u2019s Mauryan era.\n\nFor effective administration in the growing Mauryan Empire, meritorious public personnel were needed.\nAdhyakshas and Rajukas were the titles given to government servants by the Mauryan government.\nThe rules for hiring and promoting government workers, the requirements for loyalty throughout the hiring process, the procedures for evaluating their performance, as well as their code of conduct, are all laid out in Kautilya\u2019s Arthashastra.\nThe Arthashastra mentions some checks and balances on their appointments and caution. It also suggests a continuous watch on the operation of the civil service, including regularly updating the monarch on their performance.\n\nDuring Medieval India, Akbar started land reforms and created the Land Revenue System, which ultimately became a crucial part of the Indian Taxation System. His view of service was regulated and welfare-oriented.\n\nCivil Service Reforms during British Period\n\nBy means of a royal charter from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I, the East India Company was established in the year 1600 CE with the purpose of trading valuable Indian goods like silk and spices.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Company built outposts or factories throughout the Indian coasts, particularly at Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, to support its trade. The business needed staff to protect its property, which gradually led to the hiring of soldiers for their factories, which quickly transformed into their forts.\nHowever, because the East India Company\u2019s mandate was restricted to commerce, it never established any specific services for the government.\nOfficers of the East India Company used to be chosen by the company\u2019s directors, trained at London\u2019s Haileybury College\u00a0and then dispatched to India.\n\nThe Regulating Act of 1773 gave the British government power over the Company\u2019s management.\n\nAfter being appointed Governor General of India in February 1786, Lord Cornwallis implemented a number of legislative and administrative changes.\n\nIn order to enhance the general governance of the East India Company in India, he passed the Cornwallis Code in 1793. This law established the separation of the judicial and tax administrations.\nDue to his reforms and reorganizations of the Company\u2019s administration, he is also known as the Father of Civil Service in India.\nLord Cornwallis forbade civil officers from accepting gifts or bribes in order to curb widespread corruption among corporate employees. Even worse, he increased their pay and forbade the recruits from engaging in private trade for such employees.\nCivil Service Reforms under Lord Macaulay\n\nThe Charter Act of 1833 granted native Indians the right to participate in administration in British India.\n\nUnder Lord Macaulay\u2019s leadership, the First Law Commission of India was established under the Constitution, and it made recommendations for the codification of the Criminal Procedure Code, Penal Code, and other laws.\n\nAfter the Select Committee of the British Parliament\u2019s submission of Lord Macaulay\u2019s Report, the idea of a merit-based modern civil service in India was first floated in 1854.\nThe report made the recommendation that the patronage-based system of the East India Company be replaced by a merit-based permanent civil service with entrance through competitive exams.\nA Civil Service Commission was established in London in 1854 as a result of the suggestions, and competitive examinations began in 1855.\n\nThe Indian Civil Services Act of 1861 was passed as a result of Lord Macaulay\u2019s recommendations, allowing Indians to compete on an equal footing with British citizens in an open merit-based recruiting process.\n\nThe age range for the Indian Civil Service examinations was initially established at 18 to 23 years old, and they were exclusively held in London.\nIndians have a more challenging time succeeding since the curriculum was structured to benefit British citizens.\nThe first Indian to pass the test was Shri Satyendranath Tagore, the brother of Shri Rabindranath Tagore, in 1864.\nAitchison Committee on Public Services, 1886\n\nIndians petitioned for simultaneous tests to be held in India over the course of the following 50 years, but they did not have much success since Britishers were wary of hiring many Indians because they believed the service would become too Indianized.\n\nHowever, in the years after the Indian National Congress was founded in 1885, there was a rising desire for simultaneous examination in India and London, along with a call to increase the upper age restriction. This led to more major civil service reforms in the country.\n\nAitchison Committee on Public Services was established by Lord Dufferin in 1886 to look at the issues with the Indian public service in response to these growing demands, particularly those made by the Moderate faction of the Indian National Congress, who supported the notion of representation.\n\nAdditionally, the Commission proposed that the phrases \u201ccovenanted\u201d and \u201cuncovenanted\u201d be changed to \u201cimperial\u201d and \u201cprovincial,\u201d which was approved.\nIt recommended that Indians take open civil service tests between the ages of 19 and 23, respectively.\nThe covenanted civil service became known as the Civil Service of India when Aitchison\u2019s recommendations were accepted.\nThe provincial service was given that province\u2019s name.\nMontague-Chelmsford Reforms\n\nIn terms of Indian history, the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, which were implemented by the Government of India Act, of 1919, are best known for bringing dyarchy, or executive councilor and popular minister control, to the subcontinent.\n\nHowever, it also acceded to the long-standing demand for India to host civil service exams.\nIn accordance with the pledges, the Indian Civil Service Examination started to be held in India starting in 1922 in addition to London.\nThe Government of India Act of 1919 also allowed for the creation of the Public Service Commission of India, which was finally constituted in October of 1926 and had previously been suggested by the Islington Commission.\nIn its 1917 report, the Islington Commission (1917) suggested that 25 percent of the top government positions go to Indians.\nThe Islington Commission\u2019s suggestion was rejected because of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, which suggested that one-third of all appointments to senior positions in the services should be made to Indians.\nRoyal Commission on the Superior Civil Services in India- Lee Commission, 1923\n\nThe appointment of the Royal Commission on the Superior Public Services in India, generally known as the Lee Commission, might be considered the next significant move in the permeation of civil services with Indian roots.\n\nThe Commission, which had an equal number of Indian and British members, was established by the British administration in 1923 to examine the racial makeup of the superior Indian public services of the Government of India.\nEarlier, the Islington Commission (1917) had suggested that Indians should hold 25% of the senior government positions in its 1917 report.\nThe All-India Services and the Central Services were two service categories whose current positions were assessed by the Lee Commission together with the recommendations made in the Islington Commission report.\nThe Provincial Services were not taken into consideration because the Provincial Governments already had jurisdiction over them.\nBased on the Islington Commission\u2019s recommendations, the Lee Commission recommended in 1924 that 40 percent of future entrants should be British and 40 percent should be Indians directly recruited, with the other 80 percent of superior posts to be filled by promotions from provincial civil services.\nThe Lee Commission advised that the statutory Public Service Commission envisioned by the Government of India Act, 1919, be constituted as soon as possible in its report from the year 1924.\nThe Public Service Commission was thus established in India for the first time on October 1, 1926. In addition to the Chairman, there were four other members. The first Chairman of the Commission was Sir Ross Barker, a British Home Civil Service employee.\nThe Public Service Commission (Functions) Rules, 1926, were in place to regulate its operations rather than having them outlined in the Government of India Act, 1919.\nCivil Service Reforms during British- 1940s\n\nThe Government of India Act, of 1935, which was adopted in response to the Simon Commission\u2019s recommendations, included Services of the Crown in India among other legislative, executive, and judicial measures (Part X).\n\nFor the Federation and the Province, respectively, this part provides for the Defence Services, Civil Services, Special Provisions for Judicial Officers, and Public Service Commissions.\nIn the event of a Federal Commission, the Governor-General may appoint the chairman and other members; in the case of a Provincial Commission, the Governor of the Province may appoint the chairman and other members.\nThe Federal and Provincial Service Commission was tasked with holding tests for appointments to the Federation\u2019s and the Province\u2019s services.\nThus, the Federal and Provincial Commission provision persisted until the 1950 adoption of the Constitution of India, which superseded the Government of India Act, of 1935, following extensive discussion and deliberation in the Constituent Assembly.\nConclusion\n\nAfter lengthy discussions and deliberations, the Indian Constituent Assembly chose to keep using the Indian Civil Service to run the country, much to the chagrin of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t opposed to the Administrative Service\u2019s current recruitment process, but he did want new civil service hires to be familiar with progressive socialization as a guiding principle of state policy in addition to their early selection and specialized training.\n\nThe opinion of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who had collaborated with these civil servants and held them in high regard, ultimately prevailed. Thus, the articles relating to Services under the Union and States were incorporated into the Indian Constitution by the Constituent Assembly.\n\nRelated articles: Civil Service Reforms;\u00a0Role of civil services in a democracy\n\nArticle Written By: Aryadevi E S"

What do they discuss? Who are the main poets? Which are the main books? Scroll down the page to learn more about Sangam literature.\n\nSangam literature is the name given to the earliest readable Tamil literature. While the majority of the work is believed to have been produced between 100 CE and 250 CE, the Sangam period is roughly between 300 BC and 300 AD.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSangam Literature\n\u00a0Classification of Sangam Literature\nLiterature of the Sangam: Major Works\nSilappathikaram\nManimekalai\nTolkappiyam\nEttuthogai\nPattuppattu\nPathinenkilkanakku\nSangam Literature: Implications\nConclusion\nSangam Literature\nLiterally, \u201cSangam\u201d means \u201cassociation.\u201d A collection of Tamil poets who were active in ancient southern India are mentioned.\nThe first Tamil Sangam at Madurai is said to have been presided over by the Ancient Tamil Siddhar Agastyar between the first and fourth centuries CE.\nIn early Indian literature, which is almost entirely religious, Sangam texts may be uncommon.\nThere were 473 poets who contributed to the Sangam literature, 102 of whom were unidentified. The poets came from a variety of backgrounds, including farmers, businesspeople, and members of royal families.\nAt least 27 of the poets were women.\nThese poets emerged in a setting where Tamil (Dravidian) civilization had previously mingled with north Indians (Indo-Aryans) and had irrevocably blended with both sides.\nBoth sides shared the same mythology, moral code, and canon.\nMany of the poems, especially the ones glorifying valour, are remarkably free from the literary conceits that characterise the majority of India\u2019s other early and mediaeval literature.\nThese poems lack the rich tale connections that characterize most Indian art forms and almost exclusively deal with nonreligious topics.\nHowever, Sangam poetry contains religious works as well. Sangam literature may contain poems on deities including Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, and Murugan.\n\u00a0Classification of Sangam Literature\nAkam and Puram are the two divisions of Sangam literature.\nIn the context of romantic love, sexual connection, and sensuality, akam poetry is concerned with feelings and sentiments.\nThe subject matter of Puram poetry is feats and heroism in the context of conflict and public life.\nOne-fourth of the poetry in the Sangam is puram-themed, while three-fourths of it has an akam topic.\nSeven minor genres called tinai are used to categorize Sangam literature, which includes akam and puram.\nThe setting or scenery of the poetry is the primary focus of this minor genre.\nKurinci denotes mountainous areas, mullai denotes pastoral forests, marutam denotes riverine agricultural land, neytal denotes coastal regions, and palai denotes dry areas.\nIn addition to tinais based on landscapes, akam poetry also uses tinais based on ain-tinai (well-matched, mutual love), kaikilai (ill-matched, one-sided), and perunthinai (unsuited, big genre).\nThe 500-short poem collection The Ainkurunuru is an illustration of reciprocal love poetry.\nSimilar tinais also apply to puram poetry; these include vetchi (cattle raid), vanchi (invasion, war preparation), kanchi (tragedy), ulinai (siege), tumpai (fight), vakai (victory), paataan (elegy and applause), karanthai, and pothuval.\nThe akam poetry uses imagery and metaphors to create a mood; it never includes names of people or locations and frequently omits context, which the community would fill in and understand given their oral history.\nPuram poetry is more straightforward and makes use of names and places.\nLiterature of the Sangam: Major Works\nBecause the three great epics of the time, Silappathigaram, Dipavamsa, and Mahavamsa, demonstrate that Cheran Senguttuvan of the Chera dynasty and Gajabhagu II of Sri Lanka were contemporaneous, the dating of Sangam literature is still up for question.\nAdditionally, large numbers of coins made by the Roman Emperor in the first century can be unearthed throughout Tamil Nadu.\nAdditionally, Greek writers like Megasthenes, Strabo, and Pliny asserted that the West and South India had trading relations.\nThe Cheras, Chola, and Pandya kings who ruled in the region south of the Mauryan Empire were mentioned in inscriptions from the Ashokan Empire.\nThe Sangam literature has been dated to the third century B.C. to the third century A.D. based on literary, archaeological, and extraterritorial evidence.\nThe Sangam literature is made up of the two epics Silappathikaram and Manimegalai, Tolkappiyam, Ettutogai, Pattuppattu, and Pathinenkilkanakku.\nBoth Silappathigaram by Elango Adigal and Manimegalai by Sittalai Sattanar were released in the postmodern era.\nThese books contain vital details on the Sangam society and governmental structure.\nThe Tamil Brahmi writing dates to the 15th century and is described in the Kalugumalai inscription.\nBoth the dreadful destiny of Tamil poets and local chieftains are mentioned in the Tirukkovalur inscription.\nThe Tolkappiyam, the first of these writings, was composed by Tolkappiyar and includes Tamil grammar in addition to details regarding the social, economic, and political conditions during the Sangam Age.\nThe eight Anthologies, each with eight parts, made up Ettutogai.\nThe two main groupings of Ettutogai and Pattuppattu were Aham (love) and Puram (valor).\nSilappathikaram\nSilappatikaram is the first epic written in Tamil. The 5,730-line poem is almost entirely composed in the akaval (aciriyam) meter.\nIn Tamil legend, Ilango Adigal is credited with creating Silappatikaram.\nThe Fifth Ten of the Patiuppattu, a Sangam poem, describes the family and rule of Chera monarch Senguttuvan, who is claimed to be a\nThe heroes of the epic, which depicts the tragic love story of a typical couple, are Kannaki and her husband Kovalan.\nThe Silappathikaram has deeper roots in the Tamil bardic tradition, as shown by references to Kannaki and other characters from the story in later works like the Kovalam Katai as well as Sangam literature like the Naiai.\nIt is believed that a prince-turned-monk by the name of Iak Aika wrote it around the fifth or sixth century CE.\nManimekalai\nThe Tamil-Buddhist epic Manimekalai, also known as Manimekhalai or Manimekalai, was likely written in the sixth century by Manimegalai Manimegalai Kulavika Seethalai Sataar.\nThe first Tamil epic Silappadikaram\u2019s \u201clove story\u201d is followed by this \u201canti-love narrative,\u201d which features some of the same\nThe epic is composed of 4,861 lines in the akaval metre and is divided into 30 cantos.\nThe daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, who carries on her mother\u2019s legacy as a Buddhist nun and dancer, is also known by the name Manimekalai. The epic tells her story.\nTolkappiyam\nTolkappiyam is both the oldest long piece of Tamil literature still in existence and the earliest existent Tamil grammar text.\nSome people think that Tholkapiyam was written by just one person, Tholkappiyar, a student of the Vedic sage Agastya, who is mentioned in the Rigveda.\nThe existing manuscripts of the Tolkappiyam comprise three volumes (athikaram), each with nine chapters (iyal), for a total of 1,610 sutras in the nurpa metre.\nThis thorough grammar work contains sutras on grammar, spelling, phonology, etymology, morphology, semantics, prosody, sentence construction, and the significance of context in language.\nThe Tolkappiyam can\u2019t be dated in any way.\nThe verse dates to the first millennium BCE or earlier by some Tamil scholars, who place it in the legendary second sangam.\nEttuthogai\nThe Eight Anthologies, commonly known as Ettuttokai or \u201cEight Collections,\u201d is a significant piece of Tamil literature and one of the Eighteen Greater Texts (Patinen-melkanakku) anthology series published by Sangam Literature.\nThe earliest Tamil works still in existence are The Eight Anthologies (Pattuppattu) and its companion anthology, The Ten Idylls (Pattuppattu).\nThe eight pieces that make up Ettuthogai are Aingurunooru, Narrinai, Aganaooru, Purananooru, Kuruntogai, Kalittogai, Paripadal, and Padirruppatu (Eight Anthologies).\nPattuppattu\nThe Ten Idylls often referred to as Pattupattu or Ten Lays, is a collection of ten longer poems from the Sangam era of Tamil literature.\nThey range in length from 100 to 800 lines, and the collection includes Nakkirar\u2019s well-known Tirumurukarruppaai.\nThe earliest layer of the Pattupattu collection dates from the second to third century CE, the middle layer from the second to fourth century CE, and the final layer from the third to fifth century CE.\nThe Pattupattu is made up of 10 works: Thirumurugarruppadai, Porunarruppadai, Sirupanarruppadai, Perumpanarruppadai, Mullaippattu, Nedunalvadai, Madurai Kanji, Kurinjippatttu, Pattinappalai, and Malaipadukadam (Ten Idylls).\nPathinenkilkanakku\nIn literature, the Pathinenkilkanakku often referred to as the Eighteen Lesser Texts, is a collection of eighteen poems, most of which were composed in the \u201cfollowing Sangam period\u201d (between 100 and 500 CE).\nPathinenkilkanakku contains 18 books on morality and ethics.\nThe most significant of these writings is Tirukkural, which was composed by eminent Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar.\nThe poems in this collection are shorter and written in venpa metre than those found in the Eighteen Greater Texts, which are the oldest known collections of Tamil poetry.\nThis collection\u2019s sole anthology, Naladiyar, has been sung by 400 poets.\nSangam Literature: Implications\nThe Cheras, Cholas, and Pandyas were the three principal Tamil kingdoms at this time.\nThe Sangam literature offers historical proof of South India\u2019s indigenous literary development concurrent with Sanskrit, as well as the status of Tamil as a classical language.\nThe literature that has survived attests to a group of intellectuals located in ancient Madurai who had an impact on the \u201cliterary, academic, cultural, and linguistic life of ancient Tamil Nadu\u201d even if there is scant evidence for the first and second legendary Sangams.\nThe Sangam literature offers an understanding of a number of facets of ancient Tamil culture, as well as of both secular and religious concepts and persons.\nSanskrit loan words are present in the Sangam literature, indicating continued linguistic and literary exchanges between Tamil Nadu and other parts of the Indian subcontinent in antiquity.\nSangam poetry is focused on people and culture. It is almost entirely non-religious, with the occasional allusion to Hindu gods and larger allusions to many gods in the shorter poems.\nConclusion\n\nSangam, a phrase from the Sanskrit language, means \u201cassociation.\u201d It refers to Tamil Sangam, a group of Tamil poets who lived in the distant past of South India. From the first through the fourth centuries CE, the Ancient Tamil Siddhar Agastyar is thought to have presided over the first Tamil Sangam at Madurai. In early Indian literature, which is virtually purely religious, the Sangam works.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

It has since evolved and been adapted for the stage, recognized for its vibrant and energetic movements.\nThemes: Primarily focuses on the stories and teachings from the Bhagavad Gita and other Hindu epics.\n\nFolk & Tribal Dances:\n\nExamples: Bhangra (Punjab), Garba (Gujarat), and Lavani (Maharashtra), each embodying the joy, rituals, and colours of their respective regions.\n\nAccording to Bharata\u2019s Natya Shastra, Lord Brahma merged elements from the four Vedas to form the fifth Veda, known as Natya Veda, after being asked by the Gods to create a pastime.\n\nWith lyrics from the Rig Veda, gestures from the Yajur Veda, music from the Sam Veda, and emotions from the Atharva Veda, the Natya is a combination of dance, drama, and music.\nThis demonstrates the spiritual significance dance holds in Indian cultural tradition. Indian mythology is rife with instances of dance styles and expressions, from Shiva\u2019s tandava dance, which symbolizes the cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction, to Parvati\u2019s feminine response.\nA similar emphasis on dance as a form of social amusement may be seen in the engravings of communal dancing at Bhimbetka and the sculpture of the Bronze Dancing Girl from the Harappan Civilization.\nIn Bharata\u2019s well-known work Natyashastra, which is a thorough and vivid treatise on the numerous components of Indian classical dance, the word \u201cdance\u201d is first formally used.\nThe text, which was likely put together between 200 BC and 200 AD, provides detailed descriptions of the techniques, postures, emotions, ornamentation, stage, and even clothing.\nDance, according to Bharata Muni, is the \u201cwhole art,\u201d including all other art forms such as music, sculpture, poetry, and theatre.\nDifferent dance forms have developed with their distinctive subtleties in various parts of India. The core of Indian classical art is the guru-shishya parampara.\nEight classical dance genres, including Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Mohiniattam, Odissi, Manipuri, Kathak, and Sattriya, are now practised in India, according to Sangeet Natak Akademi.\nFolklore, stories, and myths from throughout India, mixed with regional song and dance customs, produce a diverse range of composite art. The majority of the time, folk dances are untrained, spontaneous, and performed by the masses without any training\n\nAlso read: Classical Dances of India;\u00a0Folk dances of India\n\nMusic\nClassical Music:\nHindustani: Predominant in Northern India, it is known for its raga system, improvisation, and emotional depth.\nCarnatic: Popular in Southern India, it\u2019s celebrated for its structured, composition-based performances.\nFolk Music:\nOverview: Diverse and region-specific, Indian folk music is the voice of the soil, reflecting the daily life, aspirations, and folklore of various communities.\nDevotional Music:\nExamples: Bhajans, Kirtans, and Qawwalis are performed across the country, expressing spiritual longing and devotion.\n\nAny culture\u2019s soul is its music, and India has a long history of inventive music. The sage Narada Muni is credited with bringing music to the planet. The seven-holed flute has been discovered among the artefacts from the Indus Valley Civilization.\n\nTwo thousand years ago, during the Vedic era, the earliest literary references to music were discovered. The Sama Veda has all seven notes of the raga Kharaharapriya in decreasing sequence. An Upaveda of the Sama Veda is the science of music known as the Gandharva Veda.\nThe Indian subcontinent is home to a wide variety of music that falls into various categories. Some are more inclined toward classical music, while others are experimenting with world music.\n\nThe public is becoming more and more interested in the recent trend of fusing classical heritage with other musical genres like pop and jazz. Indian music can be categorized as follows:\n\nCarnatic and Hindustani styles of music are considered classical.\nFolk music\n\nIndia is a geographically diverse nation, and this diversity is represented in the Indian culture as well. This nation has its kind of music, which serves as the foundation for the affirmation of its cultural identity.\n\nFolk music is the music of the people and has no set norms, whereas classical music adheres to the Natyashastra\u2019s standards and cultivates a guru-shishya (student-mentor) tradition.\nThey have a lot of musical rhythms and are based on various subjects.

During this phase, India saw sporadic uprisings mainly due to the oppressive policies of the British.\n\nMajor Uprisings\n\nBetween 1757 and 1857, numerous revolts erupted in different parts of the country. These were primarily led by local chieftains, peasants, and tribal leaders who were directly affected by the harsh revenue policies and administrative practices imposed by the British.

He was declared the emperor of India by the rebelling sepoys, providing a symbolic unity to the rebellion against the British.\nThe First War of Independence (1857)\n\nThe Revolt of 1857 marked a significant turn in the Indian freedom struggle. Often referred to as the First War of Independence, it was a major, but ultimately unsuccessful, uprising against the British East India Company.\n\nKey Events\n\nThe revolt began in Meerut on May 10, 1857, and soon spread to several parts of northern and central India. Major battles occurred in Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur, and Jhansi, with local rulers, sepoys, and civilians participating actively.\n\nNotable Figures\nMangal Pandey: Pandey played a pivotal role in igniting the rebellion.

He was instrumental in the recapture of Gwalior and led his troops with agility and surprise against the British forces.\nFormative Phase (1885-1905)\n\nPost-1857, nationalistic sentiments were channelled into forming organized movements. The Indian National Congress (INC) was established during this period, marking the beginning of a new phase in the Indian freedom struggle.\n\nIndian National Congress\n\nFounded in 1885 by A.O. Hume, the INC played a significant role in the freedom struggle. Initially, it was a platform for civil servants to express their views on British policies, but over time, it became the principal leader of the Indian nationalist movement.\n\nLeaders of the Phase\nDadabhai Naoroji: Known as the \u2018Grand Old Man of India\u2019, Naoroji was a prominent leader of the INC and the first Indian to be a British MP.

The Movement began as a response to the partition of Bengal by Viceroy Lord Curzon in 1905, aimed at dividing and ruling by creating religious divisions.\n\nContext and Overview\n\nCurzon\u2019s decision was ostensibly based on administrative convenience, but it was widely perceived as a \u2018divide and rule\u2019 strategy.

National educational institutions like the Bengal National College were established.\nSpread of the Movement: Initially starting in Bengal, the movement spread to other parts of India, fostering a sense of nationalism and unity among diverse groups of people.\nChallenges and Legacy\n\nThough the Swadeshi Movement eventually slowed down due to various reasons including differences within the INC and repressive measures by the British, it left an indelible mark on India\u2019s struggle for freedom. The Movement sowed the seeds for future mass movements led by Gandhi and others, creating a legacy of resistance and self-reliance that would continue until India gained independence in 1947.\n\nGandhian Era (1915-1947)\n\nThe Gandhian Era marks a significant chapter in India\u2019s freedom struggle, embodying non-violent resistance, civil disobedience, and grassroots mobilization.

Your wives and daughters?\u201d\n\nCama\u2019s stance concerning the vote for women was, however, secondary to her position on Indian independence.\n\nIn 1920, upon meeting Herabai and Mithan Tata, two Parsi women outspoken on the issue of the right to vote, Cama is said to have observed: \u201cWork for Indian\u2019s freedom and independence. When India is independent women will not only have the right to vote, but all other rights.'\u201d\n\nDue to her involvement in anti-colonial activities, she was forced into exile from India. She settled in various countries, including France and England.\n\nShe returned to India in 1935 after receiving a pardon from the British government.\n\nPublications\n\nBhikaiji Cama began to publish booklets for the Indian community in England, propagating the cause of Swaraj.\n\nCama wrote, published, and distributed revolutionary literature for the movement, including Bande Mataram (founded in response to the Crown ban on the poem Vande Mataram).\nMadan\u2019s Talwar in response to the execution of Madan Lal Dhingra.\nThese weeklies were smuggled into India through the French colony of Pondicherry.\nLegacy of Bhikaiji Cama\n\nMadam Bhikaiji Cama passed away on August 13, 1936. She is remembered as a fearless patriot, a pioneering woman leader, and a symbol of India\u2019s struggle for freedom.\n\nHer commitment to the cause of Indian independence and her efforts to garner international support for it remain noteworthy aspects of her legacy.\n\nBhikaiji Cama\u2019s legacy continues to inspire generations of Indians. Her contribution to the design of the Indian National Flag earned her a special place in India\u2019s history.\n\nMadam Bhikaiji Cama\u2019s activism in the spheres of women\u2019s rights and Indian independence made her a trailblazing figure in the history of India\u2019s struggle for freedom and women\u2019s empowerment. Her commitment to both causes reflects the interconnectedness of gender equality and national liberation in the context of India\u2019s fight for independence.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

        "[CONTENT]": "Indian feudalism does not fit into the definition of the Western system of feudalism. But till India became a republic, a form of feudalism existed in the country. Read here to know more.\n\nThe concept of \u201cfeudalism\u201d as it is traditionally understood in European history does not have a direct equivalent in Indian history.\n\nThere were socio-economic and political structures in ancient and medieval India that exhibited certain features resembling feudalism in some respects.\n\nThese structures were diverse and varied across different regions and periods.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of Indian Feudalism\nMedieval period\nFeatures of Indian feudalism\nImpact of feudalism on Indian society\nDifference between Indian and European feudalism\nConclusion\nHistory of Indian Feudalism\n\nFrom the post-Maurya period, and especially from Gupta times, certain political and administrative developments tended to feudalize the state apparatus.\n\nThe most striking development was the practice of making land grants to the Brahmanas, a custom sanctified by the injunctions laid down in the Dharmasastras, and the Puranas.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe early Pali texts of the pre-Maurya period refer to the villages granted to the Brahmanas by the rulers of Kosala and Magadha, but they do not mention the abandonment of any administrative rights by the donors.\n\nThe Mauryan Empire (322-185 BCE) made significant use of land grants to reward officials, military commanders, and religious institutions.\n\nThe same is the case with the earliest epigraphic record of a land grant, a Satavahana inscription of the 1st century BCE, which refers to the grant of a village as a gift in the Ashvamedha sacrifice.\n\nAdministrative rights were perhaps given up for the first time in the grants made to Buddhist monks by the Satavahana ruler Gautamiputra Satakarni in the 2nd century CE. The land granted to them could not be entered by royal troops, and ill-treated by the government.\n\nMedieval period\n\nThe concept of feudalism gained prominence during the medieval period in India, particularly between the 7th and 12th centuries.\n\nThe emergence of feudalism in India was influenced by the arrival of various foreign invaders and rulers, including the Huns, Kushans, and later the Islamic rulers.\nThe land was often granted to military commanders and nobles in exchange for military service or loyalty to the ruling monarch. These grants were known as \u201cjagirs\u201d or \u201ciqta.\u201d\nThe Delhi Sultanate (13th-16th centuries) and later the Mughal Empire (16th-19th centuries) institutionalized and expanded the system of jagirs.\nThe jagirdars (feudal lords) controlled the lands, collected revenue from peasants, and provided military support to the central authority in exchange for these privileges.\nThe Mughals, in particular, relied heavily on the zamindari and jagirdari systems to collect revenue and maintain control over vast territories.\n\nIndia\u2019s vastness and diversity led to variations in feudal structures across different regions. For example, in the Deccan region, the system of Deshmukhs and Deshpandes evolved as local intermediaries between peasants and rulers.\n\nIn the Rajput kingdoms of Rajasthan, the feudal system was based on land grants to nobility, often known as Thakurs or Rajputs.\n\nFeudalism in India began to decline with the arrival of British colonial rule in the 18th century.\n\nThe British introduced the Permanent Settlement and the Ryotwari systems, which changed landownership and revenue collection methods.\nThe Indian Rebellion of 1857 was, in part, a response to the discontent among feudal lords and landholders who saw their privileges eroding under British rule.\n\nAfter gaining independence in 1947, India implemented land reforms in many states to abolish feudal landholdings and redistribute land to the landless peasants.\n\nLand reforms aimed to address social inequalities, reduce concentration of landownership, and improve agricultural productivity.\n\nFeatures of Indian feudalism\n\nLandownership and Revenue Collection:\n\nIn various parts of India, especially during the medieval period, powerful landlords, often called \u201czamindars\u201d or \u201cjagirdars,\u201d held control over vast tracts of land.\nThese landholders collected revenue from peasants who worked on their land. The revenue collection system was similar in some ways to the feudal lord-serf relationship in Europe.\n\nHierarchy and Local Autonomy:\n\nThe zamindars and local rulers had significant autonomy in their respective regions. They often had their militias and exercised both political and economic control over their territories.\nThere was a hierarchical structure with powerful regional rulers who owed allegiance, in varying degrees, to higher authorities such as kings or emperors.\n\nService in Exchange for Land:\n\nIn some cases, rulers rewarded their nobles and officials with grants of land (jagirs) in exchange for military service, which is somewhat akin to the European feudal practice of granting fiefs (land) in return for loyalty and military support.\n\nFragmented Political Landscape:\n\nIndia\u2019s political landscape was often fragmented, with numerous small kingdoms, principalities, and local rulers. This decentralization allowed for local power centers to emerge and exercise control over specific regions.\n\nDynastic Succession:\n\nMany regions in India had hereditary rulers, and power was often passed down through family lines. This is similar to the idea of hereditary nobility in European feudalism.\n\nAgrarian Economy:\n\nAgriculture was the backbone of the Indian economy, and the control of land was central to the power and wealth of the ruling classes.\n\nCaste System and Social Hierarchy:\n\nThe caste system played a significant role in Indian society, and it had some parallels to the social hierarchy seen in feudal Europe.\nDifferent castes had specific roles and responsibilities, and there was limited social mobility.\nThe caste system coexisted with feudalism, and both systems often reinforced each other. Feudal lords and their intermediaries belonged to high castes, while lower-caste individuals often held subordinate positions in the feudal structure.\nImpact of feudalism on Indian society\n\nFeudalism, as a socio-economic and political system, had a significant impact on Indian society during various periods of its history. The extent and nature of this impact varied across regions and periods.\n\nFeudalism resulted in economic exploitation, with the feudal lords extracting surplus agricultural produce from the peasants in the form of rent or taxes. This exploitation often led to the impoverishment of the peasantry.\nFeudalism played a role in the patronage of art and culture. Feudal lords often supported the construction of temples, forts, palaces, and other architectural marvels. This led to the development of regional architectural styles and cultural traditions.\nFeudal lords enjoyed significant political power and autonomy within their domains. They often maintained their armies and had authority over local administration, justice, and law enforcement.\nFeudalism contributed to the fragmentation of political power in India, with numerous regional kingdoms and principalities ruled by local feudal lords. This led to a lack of centralized authority in many regions.\nThe exploitation and oppression associated with feudalism often gave rise to resistance movements among the peasantry and lower classes. These movements sought to challenge the authority of feudal lords and the oppressive systems they upheld.\n\nWhile feudalism as a formal system largely declined in independent India due to land reforms, remnants of feudal structures and practices can still be found in some parts of the country, particularly in the influence of local elites and landlords.\n\nThe historical legacy of feudalism in India continues to influence landownership patterns, social hierarchies, and economic disparities in various regions.\n\nRead: Popular uprisings and movements\n\nDifference between Indian and European feudalism\n\nIndian feudalism was closely intertwined with the caste system, while European feudalism had a more rigid hierarchy based on land ownership and vassalage. Additionally, the decline and transformation of these systems occurred at different times and under different circumstances.\n\nIndian\n\t\nEuropean\n\n\nIndian feudalism is believed to have existed in various forms throughout the Indian subcontinent from ancient times, with regional variations. It was not a uniform system, and its development spanned centuries.\n\t\nEuropean feudalism, on the other hand, developed during the Middle Ages (roughly from the 9th to the 15th century) in various European regions, including Western Europe, Central Europe, and parts of Eastern Europe.\n\n\nIndian society was traditionally organized into a caste system, which was a complex and hereditary social hierarchy. The caste system was distinct from feudalism but coexisted with various forms of feudal-like land tenures. Society was divided into different castes, each with its own social and occupational roles.\n\t\nEuropean feudalism was characterized by a hierarchical structure with the king or monarch at the top, followed by nobles (lords or vassals), knights, and peasants (serfs). Social mobility was limited, and one\u2019s social status was typically determined by birth.\n\n\nIndian feudalism had a mixed economic basis, with agrarian and land-based systems prevailing. Landlords and landowners played a significant role in economic activities, and various forms of land grants and taxation systems were prevalent.\n\t\nEuropean feudalism was primarily based on land ownership and land tenure. The feudal system was characterized by the granting of land (fiefs) in exchange for loyalty and military service. The agricultural economy was dominant, with the majority of the population engaged in farming.\n\n\nThe hierarchical structure in India was less uniform compared to European feudalism. Different regions had their feudal-like systems, including zamindari (landlordism) and jagirdari (land grants).\n\t\nEuropean feudalism had a clear and structured hierarchy. The monarch or king was at the top, followed by nobles who held land grants from the king. Vassals swore allegiance to nobles and provided military service in exchange for land (fiefs).\n\n\nIndian feudalism gradually transformed and integrated into different political and economic systems over time. The decline of feudal-like structures in India was influenced by historical events, including colonialism.\n\t\nEuropean feudalism went through a process of decline and transformation during the late Middle Ages and into the early modern period. Factors such as the growth of towns and trade, changes in military technology, and the centralization of power contributed to its decline.\nConclusion\n\nThe Indian subcontinent is vast and diverse, and the nature of governance and socio-economic structures varied considerably from one region to another and across different periods.\n\nThe term \u201cfeudalism\u201d is a Western construct used to describe specific socio-economic and political arrangements in medieval Europe, and applying it directly to the Indian context can be overly simplistic.\n\nThe systems in India were shaped by a complex interplay of historical, cultural, and regional factors.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Later, the capital was shifted to Vaijayanti (modern-day Banavasi).\n\nUnder the leadership of the Kadamba kings, the dynasty expanded its influence in the Western Deccan region, encompassing parts of modern Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra.\nMayurasharma and his successors successfully resisted invasions by the Chalukyas and the Pallavas.\nRulers of Kadamba dynasty\nThe extent of the kingdom during the rule of Ravivarma\nMayurasharma: Mayurasharma is traditionally regarded as the founder of the Kadamba dynasty. He is said to have established the dynasty in the early 4th century CE. His reign marked the beginning of the Kadamba rule in the region.\nKakusthavarma I: Kakusthavarma I succeeded Mayurasharma as a ruler of the Kadamba dynasty. During his reign, the Kadambas expanded their territory and influence in the southern Deccan.\nKakusthavarma II: Kakusthavarma II was another significant ruler of the Kadamba dynasty. His reign is noted for its contributions to literature and the arts. He is said to have patronized poets and scholars.\nShantivarman: Shantivarman is believed to have been one of the later rulers of the Kadamba dynasty. His reign is associated with the propagation of Jainism in the region.\nShivakoti: Shivakoti was another prominent ruler of the Kadamba dynasty. His rule saw the continuation of the dynasty\u2019s influence and territorial expansion.\nRavivarma: Ravivarma (485 CE) was able to build the kingdom back to its original might during a long rule lasting up to 519 CE. His rule was marked by internal conflicts and clashes with the Pallavas and Gangas. He defeated the Vakatakas as well.\nHarivarman: Harivarman is one of the last known rulers of the Kadamba dynasty. His reign marked a period of decline for the dynasty, and it is suggested that the dynasty eventually succumbed to the influence of the Chalukya dynasty.\n\nIn the 10th century CE, a revival of the Kadamba dynasty occurred under the ruler Kadamba Jayake\u015bi. However, this revival did not lead to a significant resurgence of the dynasty\u2019s power.\n\nKadambas of Goa\n\nThe Kadambas of Goa was an offshoot of the earliest Kadamba family of Karnataka, the Kadambas of Banav\u00e4si who ruled between the 4th and 6th centuries CE.\n\nThe Kadambas were allies of the Chalukyas, whom they aided in defeating the Rashtrakutas, according to the Savai vere inscription.\n\nWith the rise of Chalukyas of Badami they lost their imperial status and some members of the family migrated to different places and served as subordinates of the imperial rulers.\nLater, in 960 CE, Shashthadeva defeated the Shilaharas at Chandrapur and founded the Goan Kadamba dynasty.\nThe Kadambas of Goa were one such family who were feudatories under the Chalukyas of Kalyani and continued to serve the subsequent ruling families.\nThough feudatories, they almost enjoyed a regal status with their administrative system in their jurisdiction which covered Goa and almost the whole of Dharwad and Belgaum districts of Karnataka.\nAdministration, Religion, and Culture\n\nThe Kadamba kings, like their predecessors the Satavahanas, called themselves Dharmamaharajas and followed them closely in their administrative procedures.\n\nThe kings were well read and some were even scholars and men of letters.\nInscriptions describe the founding king Mayurasharma as \u201cVedangavaidya Sharada\u201d (\u201cmaster of the Vedas\u201d), Vishnuvarma was known for his proficiency in grammar and logic, and Simhavarma was called \u201cskilled in the art of learning\u201d.\n\nThe kingdom was divided into provinces or regions, each governed by local chieftains or nobles who were usually related to the ruling family.\n\nThe kingdom was divided into provinces (Mandalasor\u00a0Desha). Under a province was a district (Vishayas), nine of which have been identified by Panchamukhi.\nUnder a district was a\u00a0Taluk\u00a0(Mahagramas) comprising numerous villages under which were the villages in groups of ten (Dashagrama).\nThe smallest unit was the village (Grama) which appears to have enjoyed particular freedoms under the authority of the headman (Gramika).\nThe provincial governors, known as Mahamandaleshvaras, enjoyed a degree of autonomy in their respective regions.\nLand revenue was a significant source of income for the Kadamba dynasty. Revenue officials, known as Amatyas or revenue officers, were responsible for collecting taxes and ensuring the proper administration of revenue.\n\nSeveral important positions of government were identified:\n\nThe prime minister (Pradhana)\nsteward of household (Manevergade)\nSecretary of the council (Tantrapalaor\u00a0Sabhakarya Sachiva)\nscholarly elders (Vidyavriddhas)\nphysician (Deshamatya)\nprivate secretary (Rahasyadhikritha)\nchief secretary (Sarvakaryakarta)\nchief justice (Dharmadhyaksha) above who was the king himself\nother officials (Bhojakaand\u00a0Ayukta)\nrevenue officers (Rajjukas)\nthe writers and scribes (Lekhakas)\n\nThe Kadamba dynasty is associated with the patronage of Jainism and Brahmanism. Kadamba rulers supported both religious traditions.\n\nThey made contributions to literature and art, with notable works composed during their rule.\n\nInscriptions in the Kannada language were used to record royal decrees and achievements. These inscriptions provide valuable historical information about the Kadamba dynasty.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe dynasty is primarily associated with the Kadamba style of architecture, characterized by its distinctive features.\n\nThe Kadambas are credited with the creation of several cave temples in the Western Ghats region, particularly in present-day Karnataka.\nThe cave temples were hewn out of solid rock, and they often consisted of a sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha), a hall (mandapa), and sometimes a separate shrine for Nandi, the bull associated with Lord Shiva.\nThe most famous example of Kadamba rock-cut architecture is the cave temple at Arvalem (Harvalem) in Goa, dedicated to Lord Shiva. It features intricate carvings and sculptures on the pillars and walls.\n\nKadamba temple architecture evolved from rock-cut cave temples to structural temples constructed using stone and brick.\n\nTemples often followed a trikuta (three-shrined) or ekakuta (single-shrined) plan, with a shikhara (tower) over the sanctum sanctorum.\nThe Kadamba shikhara (tower) is a distinct feature of their temple architecture. It is pyramidal and typically rises above the sanctum.\nThese shikhara are relatively simple compared to the more ornate and elaborate shikhara seen in later Dravidian and Nagara styles of temple architecture.\n\nKadamba style of architecture contributed to the development of the Dravidian temple architecture style, which is prominent in the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.\n\nDecline of Kadamba dynasty\n\nThe Kadamba dynasty gradually declined in the 6th century CE. Various factors, including internal conflicts, external invasions, and the rise of other regional powers, contributed to its decline.\n\nThe rise of Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas was another major factor, wherein the Kadamba capital was later taken by the Chalukyas.\n\nDespite its relatively short duration, the Kadamba dynasty left a lasting legacy in South Indian history. It contributed to the development of early Dravidian architecture and art.\n\nThe dynasty\u2019s inscriptions and coins provide valuable historical and epigraphic records.\n\nThe Kadamba dynasty is an important chapter in the history of South India, representing a period of regional power and cultural development. It played a role in shaping the historical and cultural landscape of Karnataka and the surrounding regions.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

They cover a wide area, reflecting the extent of the Mauryan Empire.\n\nThe inscriptions are written in various scripts and languages of the time, including Prakrit (a precursor to modern Indian languages) and Brahmi script. Later inscriptions, such as those on the pillars, are often in Sanskrit.\n\nThe content of Ashoka\u2019s edicts includes a variety of themes and messages:\n\nPromoting Buddhist principles: Many of the edicts emphasize the principles of non-violence, compassion, and moral conduct associated with Buddhism. Ashoka himself converted to Buddhism and became a prominent patron of the religion.\nSocial and ethical teachings: The edicts promote values such as truthfulness, kindness to animals, respect for elders, and tolerance of other religious traditions.\nAdministrative instructions: Some edicts detail administrative policies, including measures to improve the welfare of the people and provide healthcare.\nDhamma (Dharma): Ashoka\u2019s concept of Dhamma, which can be loosely translated as righteous duty, is a recurring theme in the edicts.

This includes a conservative approach to issues such as dress code, music, and gender segregation.\nWahhabism is known for its iconoclastic tendencies, leading to the destruction of various Islamic heritage sites and shrines that it considers as promoting \u201cshirk\u201d (associating partners with Allah).\nThe spread of Wahhabism was significantly influenced by an alliance between Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and Muhammad ibn Saud, the ruler of the region that later became Saudi Arabia.\nThis alliance provided religious legitimacy to the House of Saud, which established the first Saudi state in the 18th century.\n\nToday, Saudi Arabia is often associated with the promotion of Wahhabi Islam.\n\nWahhabism has played a central role in shaping the religious and cultural landscape of Saudi Arabia.

They aimed to revive and propagate orthodox Islamic beliefs and practices.\nShirk, the sin of associating partners with God in worship, was a major concern for the Faraizis.\nThey emphasized strict monotheism (Tawhid) and condemned any practices that they saw as compromising it, such as the worship of saints and the use of amulets.\nThe Faraizi Movement stressed the importance of leading a simple and pure life according to Islamic principles. They discouraged ostentatious rituals and practices.\n\nThe movement advocated for social equality among Muslims.\n\nThey opposed the social hierarchies that had developed within the Muslim community, where some segments considered themselves superior to others.\nThe Faraizis believed that all Muslims, regardless of their social status, were equal before God.\nThe Faraizi Movement rejected religious innovations (Bid\u2019ah) that had been incorporated into Islamic practices over time.\nThey aimed to return to what they considered the pure and original form of Islam, as practiced during the time of the Prophet Muhammad.\nThe Faraizis discouraged practices and customs that they believed were influenced by non-Muslim cultures. They sought to establish a distinct Muslim identity.\n\nThe movement spread its message through preaching and sermons, known as waaz.

Some followers believed that the British government was not adequately protecting their religious and social rights.\n\nThe Faraizi Movement had a significant impact on the religious and social landscape of Bengal during the 19th century.\n\nWhile it remained primarily a regional movement, it contributed to a revival of orthodox Islamic beliefs and practices among certain segments of the Muslim population in Bengal.\nAdditionally, it influenced subsequent religious and social reform movements in the Indian subcontinent.\nThe Faraizi movement even though focused on Islamic revivalism, had most importantly invoked a new awareness among peasants against the exploitations by zamindars.\nConclusion\n\nBoth the Faraizi and Wahhabi Movements were responses to perceived deviations from what their followers believed to be the authentic practice of Islam.\n\nThey played roles in shaping religious thought and practice in their respective regions and eras, contributing to the broader landscape of Islamic revivalism in South Asia.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, the Wahhabi Movement influenced various Islamic reformist movements and scholars. It contributed to debates on religious practices and the role of Sufism within the broader Islamic tradition. Wahhabi-inspired ideas and reformist approaches continue to shape Islamic discourse in the region.\n\nThe Faraizi Movement had a significant impact on the social and religious life of the Bengal region.

He is credited with expanding his kingdom\u2019s territory and establishing strong diplomatic relations with neighboring states.\nRajyavardhana: Rajyavardhana, the elder son of Prabhakaravardhana, succeeded his father as the ruler of the Pushyabhuti dynasty. He is known for his support of scholars and poets and his patronage of the arts and culture.\nHarsha (Harsha Vardhana, 590-647 CE): Harsha, the younger son of Prabhakaravardhana, is the most famous ruler of the Pushyabhuti dynasty. He is often referred to as Emperor Harsha. His reign is considered a golden period in ancient Indian history. Harsha was a great patron of literature and culture, and his court attracted many scholars, poets, and artists.\nRajashekhara: After the death of Harsha, Rajashekhara, a minister succeeded him as the ruler of the Pushyabhuti dynasty. However, his reign was relatively short, and he faced challenges in maintaining the vast empire.\nPrabhakarvardhana II: Following Rajashekhara\u2019s reign, Prabhakarvardhana II briefly ruled over the remnants of the dynasty\u2019s territories.\nAdministration and military\n\nThe Pushyabhuti dynasty followed a monarchical system of governance. The king held the highest authority and wielded significant power.\n\nHarsha\u2019s empire was vast, encompassing much of northern and northwestern India. To govern such a vast territory, he divided it into provinces or regions, each administered by provincial governors or officials known as Samantas.\nThe provinces, known as Bhuktis, were further divided into districts and villages.\nLocal governance was carried out through village councils, known as Ganas, which played a significant role in maintaining law and order at the grassroots level.\n\nThe Harshacharita is full of descriptions of weapons and the love that the Pushyabhuti rulers had for their swords, for war, and for showing prowess in battle.\n\nHarsha\u2019s army had a strong cavalry component, which was often considered a significant asset in ancient Indian warfare. Cavalry units were used for reconnaissance, quick strikes, and as shock troops in battle.\nThe use of war elephants was a prominent feature of the Pushyabhuti dynasty\u2019s army. Elephants were valuable for their size and strength and were often used to create fear and confusion among enemy ranks.\nCulture and religion\n\nHarsha was initially a Shaivite Hindu but later converted to Buddhism. He was known for his religious tolerance and support for both Hinduism and Buddhism.\n\nHe convened the famous Prayaga or Kanyakubja Assembly, a grand religious gathering that included Buddhists, Hindus, and Jains.\n\nHarsha himself was a scholar and author.

The empire gradually fragmented, and regional powers rose to prominence. The decline of the dynasty marked the end of the Vardhana era.\n\nKanyakubja remained as a kingdom and once more came into the limelight under King Yashovarman (r. 725-753 CE), while most of Harsha\u2019s feudatories like Bhaskaravarman bifurcated the empire and added the conquered bits to their kingdoms.\n\nYashovarman maintained Kanyakubja as a center of power, and between 750 and 1000 CE, its significance increased to the point that conquering it became a sign of imperial power in India, even for politically remote states like the Rashtrakutas of southern India, the Pratiharas of northwestern India, and Palas of eastern India.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Two branches are known and two are unknown. The known branches are the Pravarpura-Nandivardhana branch and the Vatsagulma branch.\n\nVakataka Rulers\nVindhyashakti (c. 250-270 CE): Vindhyashakti is considered the founder of the Vakataka dynasty. He established his authority in the region of Vidarbha, with his capital at Pravarapura (modern-day Paunar in Maharashtra).\nPravarasena I (c. 270-330 CE): Pravarasena I succeeded his father, Vindhyashakti, and expanded the Vakataka territory. He was a patron of literature and the arts. He was the first Vakataka ruler, who called himself a\u00a0Samrat and became an emperor in his own right with his kingdom covering a good portion of North India and the whole of Deccan\nNarendrasena (c. 330-355 CE): Narendrasena was known for his military achievements and efforts to consolidate the Vakataka kingdom.\nPrithvisena I (c. 355-380 CE): Prithvisena I continued the expansionist policies of his predecessors and further strengthened the Vakataka dynasty\u2019s rule.\nRudrasena I (c. 380-385 CE): Rudrasena I was a prominent Vakataka ruler who ruled during a period of significant territorial expansion and political influence.\nDivakarasena (c. 385-400 CE): Divakarasena succeeded Rudrasena I and continued the dynasty\u2019s rule. He was involved in conflicts with other regional powers.\nRudrasena II (c. 400-415 CE): Rudrasena II was a renowned patron of the arts and literature. The Ajanta Caves, known for their exquisite Buddhist frescoes, are believed to have received significant support during his reign.\nPravarasena II (c. 415-455 CE): Pravarasena II is considered one of the most influential Vakataka rulers. He continued to support art and culture and had the Aihole inscription composed, which provided valuable historical information about the dynasty.\nNarendrasena II (c. 455-470 CE): Narendrasena II ruled during a period of relative stability, and his reign saw the continuation of cultural patronage.\nArchitecture, Art, and Culture\n\nThe Vakatakas were great patrons of art and culture. Vakataka architecture exhibits a blend of indigenous Indian architectural styles along with influences from other regions, including elements of Gupta and Satavahana styles.\n\nThey were responsible for the construction of several cave temples, particularly in the Ajanta Caves, which are renowned for their Buddhist frescoes and sculptures.\n\nThe Vakataka dynasty\u2019s patronage of art also extended to Ellora Caves and Elephanta Caves.\n\nCave Temples:\n\nThe Vakatakas, like many other ancient Indian dynasties, were patrons of cave temple architecture.\nThe Ajanta Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage site, are among the most famous examples of Vakataka cave architecture. These rock-cut caves include Buddhist monasteries, prayer halls, and chaitya (stupa) halls adorned with intricate sculptures and frescoes. They provide valuable insight into the art and culture of the Vakataka period.\n\nEllora Caves:\n\nWhile the Ellora Caves are more associated with the Rashtrakuta dynasty, some early caves, particularly in the Hindu group (caves 14 to 29), are attributed to the Vakataka period.\nThese caves feature Hindu deities and sculptures and are notable for their rock-cut architecture.\n\nTemples and Structural Elements:\n\nThe Vakatakas are known to have constructed structural temples, but many of these have not survived to the present day.\nSome temples, such as the rock-cut Dhumar Lena temple at Ellora, exhibit characteristics of Vakataka architecture. However, they are often eclipsed by later dynasties\u2019 more extensive temple-building activities.\n\nStupa and Chaitya Architecture:\n\nThe Vakatakas contributed to the continuation of the stupa and chaitya hall construction, which was prominent in earlier Buddhist architecture. These structures were places of worship and meditation.\n\nSculptural Art:\n\nSculpture played a significant role in Vakataka architecture. Elaborate carvings, including depictions of deities, mythical creatures, and narrative panels, adorned the cave temples and structures associated with the Vakataka dynasty.\n\nThe Vakatakas followed Hinduism and Buddhism, and their rule saw the coexistence of both religions.\n\nThey issued copper plate inscriptions in Sanskrit, contributing to the preservation of historical and cultural information.\n\nDecline of the Vakataka dynasty\n\nThe Vakataka dynasty began to decline in the late 4th century CE, partly due to internal conflicts and external invasions.\n\nThe successors of the Vakatakas, such as the Kadambas and the Chalukyas, took over their territories in different regions.\n\nThe Vakataka dynasty\u2019s architectural legacy is perhaps most prominently represented by the Ajanta Caves, which showcase their patronage of cave temple architecture and their contributions to art and culture during their rule.\n\nWhile their structural temple construction was not as prolific as some other dynasties, the Vakatakas\u2019 impact on the rock-cut architecture of India\u2019s western Deccan region is noteworthy.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Prominent among these were the Western Satraps, and the Indo-Parthian Kingdom.\n\nSome prominent rulers were:\n\nMaues (85-60 BCE): Maues is considered one of the earliest Indo-Scythian rulers. He established the Indo-Scythian rule in northwestern India and is often associated with the first coins bearing the name \u201cAzilises\u201d (a local title) in Brahmi script.\nAzilises (60-20 BCE): Azilises succeeded Maues and continued the Indo-Scythian rule in the northwest. His coins feature Greek and Brahmi inscriptions.\nGondophares (20-50 CE): Gondophares is among the most famous Indo-Parthian rulers. He is believed to have embraced Buddhism and is associated with the famous Taxila copper plate inscription that mentions his support for the religion.\n\nVarious rulers succeeded Gondophares, including Abdagases and Orthagnes.

His rule saw the flourishing of Buddhist art and culture in the Mathura region.\nVasudeva I (2nd century CE): Vasudeva I was one of the last Indo-Scythian rulers. He is associated with the beginning of the Kushan Empire\u2019s expansion into the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe Indo-Scythian rule in India gradually declined, primarily due to conflicts with other regional powers, including the Kushans and the Satavahanas. By the 4th century CE, they had largely disappeared from the Indian subcontinent.\n\nWestern Kshatrapas\n\nThe Western Kshatrapas were one of the most significant Saka dynasties in India. They ruled in the western part of India, including present-day Gujarat, Maharashtra, and parts of Rajasthan.\n\nTheir rule began around the 1st century CE and continued for several centuries.\n\nThe major rulers were:\n\nRudradaman I: One of the most famous Western Kshatrapa rulers, he is known for his extensive inscriptions, particularly the Junagadh rock inscription, which provides valuable historical information.\nNahapana: Another notable Western Kshatrapa ruler, Nahapana is known for his coinage and inscriptions. He played the main role in growing Saka\u2019s dominance at the cost of Satavahans.\nChastana: He ruled during a period of conflict with the Satavahanas and the expansion of the Kshatrapa.\n\nThe Western Kshatrapas maintained a centralized administrative system with a governor (Kshatrapa) ruling the provinces on behalf of the central authority.\n\nThey issued coins, many of which featured the ruler\u2019s likeness, often in a helmet or with a halo, on the obverse side and various symbols on the reverse side.\n\nSome Western Kshatrapa rulers, such as Rudradaman I, were known for their patronage of Buddhism and Jainism. They sponsored the construction of Buddhist stupas and the carving of Jain cave temples.\n\nThe Western Kshatrapa dynasty eventually declined due to various factors, including internal conflicts, external invasions, and the rise of other regional powers.\n\nThe Gupta Empire, which emerged in the 4th century CE, played a role in the decline of the Western Kshatrapas, as they extended their influence into western India.\n\nIndo-Scythian rule in the northwestern subcontinent ceased when the last Western Satrap Rudrasimha III was defeated by the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II in 395 CE.\nNorthern Satraps\n\nThe Northern Satraps ruled over parts of modern-day Pakistan, Afghanistan, and northern India. Their territories included regions such as Gandhara (northwestern Pakistan), Mathura, and Sindh (southern Pakistan).\n\nThe Sakas of Northern Satraps were involved in trade along the Silk Road, facilitating cultural exchanges between India, Central Asia, and the Mediterranean.\n\nThis period saw the flourishing of art, especially Gandhara art, which was characterized by the blending of Hellenistic, Indian, and Persian influences.\n\nImportant rulers of northern satraps were:\n\nRajuvula: He was a Great Satrap (Mahakshatrapa) who ruled in the area of Mathura in northern India in the years around 10 CE, under the authority of the Indo-Scythian king Azilises.\nSodasa, son of Rajuvula, seems to have replaced his father in Mathura, while Bhadayasa ruled as Basileus in Eastern Punjab.\nIndo-Parthians\n\nThe Indo-Parthians, another branch of the Sakas, established their rule in northwestern India, particularly in the regions of Gandhara and Mathura. Their rule overlapped with the Indo-Scythians, and they existed from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE.\n\nThe Parthians, known for their skilled cavalry and archery, had established the Parthian Empire in the western part of the Iranian Plateau before extending their influence eastward into parts of present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nThe Indo-Parthians, led by Gondophares, were among the first Parthian rulers to expand their rule into the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe Indo-Parthians had conflicts and alliances with the neighboring Kushan Empire, another significant power in northern India during the same period.\n\nCultural, art, and Architecture of Sakas\n\nThe Sakas dynasties in India were known for their contributions to art and culture. They blended their Central Asian heritage with Indian traditions, resulting in unique artistic styles. They also patronized Buddhism and contributed to the construction of Buddhist stupas and monasteries.\n\nThey adopted various aspects of Indian culture, including Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\nThey produced coins with bilingual inscriptions, featuring Greek and Brahmi scripts, which reflect their cultural fusion. Some Indo-Scythian kings also issued coins with Buddhist symbolism.\nIndo-Scythian art is characterized by its unique blend of Greco-Buddhist and Indian styles.\nIt often features depictions of deities and scenes from Buddhist narratives. The Gandhara region, in particular, is famous for its Indo-Scythian Buddhist art.\n\nThe Northern Satraps were known for their religious tolerance and supported a mix of religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Zoroastrianism. Many coins from their era feature deities from different faiths.\n\nIn Mathura, Rajuvula established the famous Mathura lion capital, now in the British Museum, which confirms the presence of Northern Satraps in Mathura.\n\nSakas played a role in the development of Gandhara architecture, which combined elements of Greek, Roman, and Indian architectural styles. Notable examples include stupas (Buddhist religious monuments) and monastic complexes with Greco-Roman columns and facades.\n\nDecline of the Sakas dynasties\n\nOver time, the Sakas dynasties faced various challenges, including conflicts with other regional powers, such as the Satavahanas and the Gupta Empire. Additionally, internal strife and invasions by other foreign groups contributed to their decline.\n\nThe Sakas dynasties left an indelible mark on the history and culture of India. Their artistic and architectural contributions, as well as their role in the spread of Buddhism, are part of India\u2019s historical heritage.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the history of the Sakas in India is intertwined with the broader history of the subcontinent, marked by a series of dynastic changes and cultural interactions. The Sakas\u2019 presence in India is a testament to the dynamic and diverse history of the region.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

During this phase, some notable kings include:\n\nVaragunavarman I: He was a significant Pandya ruler known for his patronage of literature and for commissioning the \u201cMattavilasa Prahasana,\u201d a famous Sanskrit play.\n\nThe Medieval Pandyas faced conflicts with other dynasties like the Cholas and Cheras over territorial control, leading to shifting power dynamics in the region.\n\nFrom the 6th century to the 9th century CE, the Chalukyas of Badami, the Pallavas of Kanchi, and the Pandyas of Madurai dominated the politics of south India.\n\nLater Pandyas (14th century CE \u2013 16th century CE)\n\nThe Later Pandyas marked a period of decline and instability for the dynasty.\n\nDuring this phase, the Pandya kingdom faced external invasions, particularly from the Delhi Sultanate and the Vijayanagara Empire, which led to the weakening and fragmentation of their rule.\n\nSome prominent Pandya rulers of this period include:\n\nJatavarman Sundara Pandyan: He was a powerful Pandya king who ruled during the 13th century CE. His reign saw conflicts with the Chola and Hoysala dynasties.\nMaravarman Kulasekara Pandyan: He was another significant Pandya ruler during the 13th century CE. His reign marked a resurgence of the Pandya dynasty\u2019s power.\nJatavarman Veerapandiyan: He was known for his battles against the Delhi Sultanate\u2019s forces, particularly the armies of Alauddin Khilji.\n\nThe last prominent Pandya ruler, Varaguna Pandya III, was defeated by the Vijayanagara Empire in the 16th century, effectively ending the Pandya dynasty\u2019s rule in Madurai.\n\nAdministration of the Pandya dynasty\n\nThe kingdom was divided into several regions, each ruled by a local chieftain or noble. These local rulers were called \u201cPalaiyakkarar\u201d or \u201cPoligars.\u201d\n\nThey were responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and contributing to the kingdom\u2019s defense.\n\nThe administration of the Pandya dynasty had various officials who helped the king govern the realm. Some of the key officials included:\n\nYuvaraja: The crown prince and heir to the throne, often given administrative responsibilities to groom them for future rule.\nManradiar: The chief minister who advised the king on various matters of governance.\nAmatya: The treasurer who managed the kingdom\u2019s finances and revenue collection.\nDuta: The emissary or ambassador responsible for diplomatic relations with neighboring kingdoms.\nMaha Samanta: The commander-in-chief who led the army and defense efforts.\nVelir: Nobles and aristocrats who held positions of power and influence.\n\nRevenue System: The kingdom\u2019s revenue system was based on land revenue and taxes levied on agricultural produce.\n\nLand revenue was collected from landowners, and a portion of the produce was taken as tax. Taxes were also collected on trade and commerce.\n\nJustice System: The Pandya administration had a judicial system to ensure justice and maintain law and order.\n\nJudges known as \u201cNyayakarar\u201d presided over courts. Disputes were settled based on traditional Dharmashastras (legal codes).\n\nThe Pandya rulers were known for their patronage of art, literature, and temple construction. They sponsored the construction of magnificent temples, which served as centers of cultural and religious life in their domains.\n\nForeign Relations: The Pandya dynasty engaged in diplomatic relations with neighboring kingdoms, including the Cholas, Cheras, and Pallavas. They also had interactions with foreign traders, particularly those from the Roman Empire.\n\nArchitecture\n\nTheir architectural style is characterized by intricately carved temples and rock-cut cave temples.\n\nThe Pandya dynasty, like other South Indian dynasties, predominantly followed the Dravidian style of temple architecture.\n\nDravidian temples are known for their towering gopurams (temple towers), large and pillared halls, and intricate sculptures.\n\nGopurams: The entrance of Pandya temples often features impressive gopurams, which are monumental, multi-story gateways adorned with detailed sculptures of gods, goddesses, mythical creatures, and various motifs. The Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai is renowned for its massive and ornate gopurams.\nVimana and Sanctum: The main shrine of a Pandya temple, called the vimana, typically has a pyramidal or stepped tower known as the shikhara. Inside the vimana, there is a sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha) where the principal deity\u2019s idol is enshrined. The sanctum is usually a dimly lit, sacred space.\nMandapa: Pandya temples have large mandapas (hallways) with intricately carved pillars. These halls are used for various rituals, congregational gatherings, and sometimes cultural performances.\nPillars and Sculptures: The pillars of Pandya temples are known for their exquisite carvings, depicting scenes from Hindu mythology, epic stories, and various deities. The sculptures are highly detailed and reflect the artistic finesse of the period.\n\nSome famous temples of the Pandya period are- Kallalagar temple, Alagar Koyil; Meenakshi Temple, Madurai; Vaishnava Nambi and Thirukurungudivalli Nachiar temple.\n\nRock-Cut Cave Temples: The Pandya dynasty also contributed to the creation of rock-cut cave temples. These temples were carved out of solid rock, with chambers and shrines inside.\n\nWater Tanks and Temple Tanks: Many Pandya temples have large water tanks or temple tanks (called \u201cErnakulam\u201d in Tamil) associated with them. These tanks often have steps leading down to the water and are used for ritual bathing and festivals.\n\nThe architectural style of the Pandya dynasty evolved and exhibited regional variations. For example, the Nayak rulers, who succeeded the Pandyas, added elements of the Indo-Saracenic style to some temples.\n\nDecline of the Pandya dynasty\n\nThe Pandya dynasty often clashed with its neighboring dynasties, particularly the Cholas and the Cheras. These frequent conflicts weakened the Pandya rulers and their territories, leading to territorial losses.\n\nThe Chola dynasty, under rulers like Rajaraja Chola and Rajendra Chola, expanded its territory and influence across South India and even into Southeast Asia.\nThe Cholas defeated the Pandyas in several battles and established their dominance in the region.\n\nDynastic disputes, rival factions within the Pandya dynasty, and weak leadership contributed to internal instability. Infighting and succession disputes weakened the dynasty\u2019s ability to resist external threats.\n\nThe Chalukya and Hoysala dynasties from the Deccan region invaded the Pandya territories, further destabilizing the dynasty. These invasions disrupted governance and administration.\n\nSouth India faced external invasions by foreign powers, including the Rashtrakutas, the Delhi Sultanate, and later, European colonial powers.\nThese invasions and foreign rule had a profound impact on the political landscape of the region.\nThe invasion of South India by Muslim dynasties, particularly the Delhi Sultanate, brought significant political changes. The Pandyas, like many other regional dynasties, had to contend with these new rulers.\n\nChanges in cultural and religious dynamics also played a role in the decline of the Pandya dynasty. The spread of Islam and the influence of the Bhakti and Sufi movements in South India altered the social and cultural landscape.\n\nThe Pandya dynasty had historically been known for its maritime trade and naval power. However, changes in trade routes and the arrival of European maritime powers diminished their influence in this area.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

It played a pivotal role in the early history of India and was instrumental in the rise of several major empires and religious movements.\n\nMagadha\u2019s history dates back to the Vedic period (around 1500-500 BCE). It was one of the sixteen Mahajanapadas (great kingdoms) mentioned in ancient Indian texts.\n\nMagadha was a significant region throughout ancient and medieval Indian history, with various dynasties ruling it at different times.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDynasties of Magadha\nHaryanka Dynasty (6th century BCE)\nShishunaga Dynasty (5th century BCE)\nNanda Dynasty (4th century BCE)\nMauryan Empire (4th \u2013 2nd century BCE)\nShunga Dynasty (2nd \u2013 1st century BCE)\nKanva Dynasty (1st century BCE)\nGupta Empire (4th \u2013 6th century CE)\nDecline of dynasties of Magadha\nDynasties of Magadha\n\nMagadha, an ancient region in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, was the seat of several powerful dynasties and played a crucial role in the political and cultural history of India.\n\nThe first or earliest ruling dynasty of Magadha was the Brihadratha dynasty founded by Brihadratha. The name is mentioned in the Rigveda and Mahabharata as well.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Brihadratha dynasty is not as well-documented or well-known as some other dynasties in ancient Indian history.\n\nAccording to Puranas Brihadratha was the eldest of the five sons of Uparichara Vasu, the Kuru king of Chedi and his queen was Girika.\nIt is said that he had a son named Jarasandha, who played a significant role in the Mahabharata, one of the major ancient Indian epics.\nJarasandha, according to the Mahabharata, was a powerful king of Magadha and a staunch adversary of the Pandava brothers. He was eventually defeated and killed by Bhima, one of the Pandavas.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the details about the Brihadratha dynasty are somewhat shrouded in myth and legend, and the historical accuracy of some accounts is debated among scholars. Due to the lack of extensive historical records, many aspects of this dynasty remain unclear.\n\nHaryanka Dynasty (6th century BCE)\n\nThe Haryanka dynasty is believed to be the earliest ruling dynasty of Magadha. King Bimbisara is the most famous ruler of this dynasty. He was a contemporary of Gautama Buddha and was an early patron of Buddhism. His son, Ajatashatru, succeeded him and continued the dynasty\u2019s rule.\n\nThe Haryanka dynasty is believed to have been founded by Bimbisara, who was the son of King Bhattiya.\n\nBimbisara\n\nBimbisara is credited with expanding the Magadha kingdom\u2019s territories through both diplomacy and military campaigns.\nHe is known for his friendly relations with Gautama Buddha and for becoming a patron of Buddhism.\nBimbisara\u2019s reign marked the beginning of the Magadha region\u2019s prominence in North India.\n\nAjatashatru\n\nBimbisara\u2019s son, Ajatashatru, succeeded him as the ruler of Magadha. Ajatashatru is known for his military conquests and the fortification of the capital city, Rajagriha (modern Rajgir).\nHe also played a role in the early development of Buddhism.\n\nUdayin\n\nAfter Ajatashatru, the Haryanka dynasty continued with Udayin, who shifted the capital from Rajagriha to Pataliputra (modern Patna). This move was significant in the context of Magadha\u2019s political and administrative history.\n\nEnd of the Dynasty\n\nThe Haryanka dynasty came to an end with the assassination of Udayin. It marked the beginning of the Shishunaga dynasty\u2019s rule in Magadha.\n\nThe Haryanka dynasty\u2019s rule marked a critical phase in the history of Magadha and the Indian subcontinent. It laid the foundation for the emergence of the powerful Maurya Empire, as Bimbisara\u2019s son, Ajatashatru, was succeeded by his son, Chandragupta Maurya. Chandragupta Maurya went on to establish one of the first major empires in India.\n\nThe Haryanka dynasty\u2019s significance lies in its role as a precursor to the larger political developments that would shape ancient India. It set the stage for the rise of Magadha as a dominant power in the region and the eventual establishment of the Maurya Empire, which played a crucial role in early Indian history.\n\nShishunaga Dynasty (5th century BCE)\n\nThe Shishunaga dynasty succeeded the Haryanka dynasty. Shishunaga is said to have overthrown the last Haryanka ruler, Nagadashaka. During this period, the Magadhan capital shifted from Rajagriha to Vaishali. This dynasty paved the way for the rise of the Nanda dynasty.\n\nThe founder of the Shishunaga dynasty was Shishunaga himself. He is believed to have usurped the throne of Magadha, which was previously under the control of the Haryanka dynasty.\n\nThe Shaishunaga dynasty ruled one of the largest empires in the Indian subcontinent. A most crucial achievement of Shishunaga was the destruction of the Pradyota dynasty of Avanti.\nThis brought to an end the hundred-year-old rivalry between Magadh and Avanti. From then Avanti became a part of Magadh.\n\nKalashoka\n\nThe two most significant events of his reign are the Second Buddhist Council at Vaishali in 383 BCE and the final transfer of the capital to Pataliputra\n\nThe Shishunaga dynasty marked the transition from the Haryanka dynasty to the more prominent Nanda dynasty, which, in turn, paved the way for the emergence of the Maurya Empire under Chandragupta Maurya.\n\nNanda Dynasty (4th century BCE)\n\nThe Nanda dynasty, founded by Mahapadma Nanda, was the first to establish a large empire in northern India. However, they are often portrayed negatively in ancient Indian texts, including the Mahabharata, for their tyranny.\n\nThe Nandas were eventually overthrown by Chandragupta Maurya, marking the rise of the Mauryan Empire.\n\nThe Nanda dynasty was founded by Mahapadma Nanda. He is said to have established the dynasty by overthrowing the last ruler of the Shishunaga dynasty, which ruled Magadha before the Nandas.\n\nThe Buddhist, Jain, and Puranic traditions all state that there were 9 Nanda kings, but the sources differ considerably on the names of these kings.\nHe was followed by his eight sons, with Dhana Nanda being the most prominent among them.\nDhana Nanda is known for his wealth and luxury, but his reign also faced significant challenges, particularly from the rise of Chandragupta Maurya.\nDhana Nanda\u2019s military strength is said to have intimidated Alexander\u2019s army who had reached the Beas River. Alexander\u2019s men mutinied when faced with the prospect of facing the Nanda army, forcing Alexander to withdraw from India.\n\nThe Nanda dynasty\u2019s most significant historical event was its confrontation with Chandragupta Maurya, who founded the Maurya Empire. Chanakya, also known as Kautilya or Vishnugupta, a prominent ancient Indian scholar and strategist, played a crucial role in Chandragupta Maurya\u2019s rise to power.\n\nChandragupta Maurya and Chanakya\u2019s strategies and military campaigns ultimately led to the downfall of the Nanda dynasty around 322 BCE.\n\nMauryan Empire (4th \u2013 2nd century BCE)\n\nAlthough the Mauryan Empire extended well beyond the boundaries of Magadha, it had its origins in this region. Chandragupta Maurya established the empire, with Pataliputra (modern-day Patna) as its capital. Under the rule of Ashoka, the Great, the Mauryan Empire reached its zenith and played a significant role in the spread of Buddhism.\n\nShunga Dynasty (2nd \u2013 1st century BCE)\n\nAfter the decline of the Mauryan Empire, the Shunga dynasty, founded by Pushyamitra Shunga, ruled over Magadha and other parts of northern India. This period saw a revival of Hinduism after the patronage of Buddhism during the Mauryan era.\n\nThe Shunga dynasty was founded by Pushyamitra Shunga, who was the commander-in-chief of the last Mauryan ruler, Brihadratha. Pushyamitra Shunga is believed to have assassinated Brihadratha and established his rule, marking the end of the Mauryan dynasty.\n\nThe Shunga dynasty\u2019s capital was initially at Pataliputra (modern-day Patna), but it later shifted to Vidisha and then to Ayodhya.\nThe Shungas were Brahmins, and they sought to restore Brahmanical Hinduism\u2019s prominence in India. They are known for their patronage of Brahmanical rituals and institutions, which saw a revival during their rule.\nThe Shunga dynasty\u2019s rise marked a period of decline for Buddhism in India, as Pushyamitra Shunga and some of his successors are believed to have been hostile to Buddhism.\nDuring the Shunga period, India faced threats from foreign invaders, particularly the Indo-Greeks. The Shunga rulers had to deal with these incursions, and the conflict with the Indo-Greeks in particular is well-documented.\n\nThe Shunga dynasty eventually declined, and its rule ended around 73 BCE when it was overthrown by the Kanvas, another dynasty in North India.\n\nKanva Dynasty (1st century BCE)\n\nThe Kanva dynasty followed the Shungas, but it had a relatively short and less significant rule. They ruled from Pataliputra but were eventually overthrown by the rise of the Satavahana dynasty in the Deccan.\n\nThe Kanva dynasty was founded by Vasudeva Kanva, who overthrew the last Shunga king, Devabhuti, in around 73 BCE. This event marked the end of the Shunga dynasty\u2019s rule.\n\nVasudeva Kanva was followed by his successors, Bhumimitra, Narayana, and Susharman, although not much is known about their reigns or accomplishments.\nThe Kanva rulers were known for their patronage of Buddhism. During their reign, Buddhist monastic institutions received support, and Buddhism continued to thrive in the region.\n\nThe Kanva dynasty came to an end in 28 BCE when it was overthrown by the Satavahana king Satakarni. This marked the beginning of the Satavahana dynasty\u2019s rule in parts of northern India.\n\nGupta Empire (4th \u2013 6th century CE)\n\nAlthough not originally from Magadha, the Gupta dynasty, which had its origins in the neighboring region of Magadha, played a crucial role in Indian history. Pataliputra served as one of its prominent capitals. The rise Gupta Empire took away the central importance of the Magadha region eventually.\n\nLater in 750 CE, the Pala Empire of Bengal also ruled over Magadha and maintained a royal camp in Pataliputra.\n\nThese are some of the major dynasties of Magadha and contributed to the rich tapestry of India\u2019s historical and cultural heritage.\n\nDecline of dynasties of Magadha\n\nThe Magadha region saw frequent changes in rulers and dynasties, leading to political instability.\n\nAfter the Mauryan Empire, several more minor dynasties like the Sungas, Kanvas, and Indo-Greeks briefly controlled the area. This lack of stable governance weakened the region\u2019s overall strength.\nForeign invasions of the Indo-Greek and later the Indo-Scythian rulers held sway over parts of Magadha, which disrupted local governance and cultural stability.\n\nMagadha\u2019s decline can also be attributed to the fragmentation of the empire. The Mauryan Empire, which was at its zenith under Ashoka, eventually disintegrated into smaller regional kingdoms.\n\nThese smaller states lacked the central authority and resources to maintain the level of influence that the Mauryan Empire had enjoyed.\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in India, which had strong roots in Magadha, played a role in the region\u2019s decline. As Buddhism waned, Hinduism gained prominence, and major centers of learning and religious activities shifted to other parts of India.\n\nGeopolitical changes, such as the rise of other powerful Indian kingdoms and foreign invasions, altered the balance of power in the subcontinent. The rise of the Gupta Empire in northern India marked a shift in emphasis away from Magadha.\n\nChanges in trade routes and economic activity also affected Magadha\u2019s prosperity. The Silk Road and other trade routes shifted, diverting commerce away from the Magadha region. Economic decline contributed to the weakening of the state.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the decline of Magadha was a gradual process that occurred over centuries, and multiple interconnected factors contributed to it.\n\nDespite its decline as a political and cultural center, Magadha\u2019s historical significance remains, as it played a crucial role in shaping the history and culture of ancient India.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish\u00a0"

His reign also witnessed the continuing decline of the Pallava dynasty as the Cholas expanded their influence in the region.\nAdministration\n\nThe Pallava dynasty, like many other Indian dynasties, was primarily a monarchy with hereditary succession. The ruling king held the highest authority in both administrative and military matters.\n\nThe Pallava Empire was divided into provinces, each of which was governed by a provincial governor or viceroy known as a \u201cMaharaja.\u201d These governors were responsible for maintaining law and order, collecting taxes, and administering justice within their respective regions.\nThe Pallavas had different capital cities during its rule.

The Satavahanas are also known as the Andhras in the Puranas.\n\nMost current academics think that the Satavahana dynasty began in the late second century BCE in the post-Maurya era, and lasted until the early third century CE.\n\nThe majority of the modern-day states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra made up the Satavahana kingdom.

Instead of the Buddhists, he patronized Brahmins and donated a substantial amount of wealth to them.\nThe Hathigumpha inscription of the Kalinga king Kharavela mentions a king named \u201cSatakani\u201d or \u201cSatakamini\u201d, who some identify with Satakarni I.\n\nAny empire\u2019s history is frequently defined by its battles with other modern powers, and in the case of the Satavahanas, the Sakas of Seistan proved to be a persistent danger.\n\nBefore the first century BCE, the East Iranian people known as the Sakas established a foothold in the Indus valley. They are also known as Indo-Scythians.\nBetween 40-80 CE, the Saka\u2019s dominance grew at the cost of the Satavahans, with Nahapana serving as their greatest conquistador.\n\nGautamiputra Satakarni is often credited with reviving the fortunes of the Satavahanas after acceding to the throne around 106 CE.\n\nHe is described as the destroyer of the Sakas, Pahlavas, and Yavanas (Saka-yavana-pahlavanisudana).\nHe decisively defeated the powerful Kshaharatha ruler Nahapala and recovered many territories that the Shakas had earlier wrested from the Satavahana\nRulers of the Satavahana dynasty\nSimuka: Simuka is considered the founder of the Satavahana dynasty. He established the dynasty and is believed to have laid the foundation for its expansion as mentioned in a Satavahana inscription at Naneghat.\nKanha (70-60 BCE): Simuka was succeeded by his brother Kanha (also known as Krishna), who extended the kingdom up to Nashik in the west.\nSatakarni I (70-60 BCE): Satakarni I was one of the significant rulers of the dynasty. He is credited with expanding the empire\u2019s boundaries and increasing its influence by conquering Kalinga.\nSatakarni II: He is said to have ruled for 56 years, during which he captured eastern Malwa from the Shungas. This allowed him access to the Buddhist site of Sanchi, in which he is credited with the building of the decorated gateways around the original Mauryan Empire and Sunga stupas.\nHala (20-24 CE): H\u0101la was a notable ruler known for his patronage of literature and the arts. He is particularly known for the compilation of the anthology \u201cGaha Sattasai,\u201d which contains poems in Prakrit.\nSivasvati (1st century CE)\nGautamiputra Satakarni (1st century CE): Gautamiputra Satakarni was one of the most famous Satavahana rulers. He is known for his military campaigns and successful efforts to consolidate and expand the empire\u2019s territories.\nVasishthiputra Pulumavi (130-159 CE): Pulumavi was the son of Gautamiputra Satakarni and continued his father\u2019s expansionist policies in and around the river Krishna.\nVashishtiputra Satakarni\nShivaskanda Satakarni\nYajna Sri Satakarni: He is another important ruler who maintained the dynasty\u2019s territorial holdings and influence. After his reign, the empire gradually declined as the succeeding monarchs weren\u2019t able to maintain their control over feudatories who in turn may have gained in strength.\nAdministration and Economy\n\nThe Satavahana rulers established a well-organized administrative system with a focus on local governance.\n\nJanapada denoted the largest territorial division of the empire.\nIt was subdivided into rashtras for administrative efficacy with the head known as Rashtrika.\nIf the Rashtra division was large, then its head came to be known as Maharathi.\nThe next sub-division was ahara which corresponds to modern districts. They were ruled by officers called Amatyas. The aharas were divided into vishayas.\nThe villages were the lowest unit of administrative division and their names mostly ended in grama or padraka.\nThe village headman was called Gramani as mentioned in some gathas of the Gatha-saptasati.\n\nThe kingdom had three grades of feudatories:\n\nRajas who struck coins in their names\nMahabhojas and Maharathis were very influential families in the western Deccan. From the inscriptions of the Satavahana period, we find that the feudatories in Thane and Kolaba districts were known as Mahabhojas while those in the Poona district were designated as Maharathis.\nMahasenapati was instituted late in the history of Satavahanas\n\nThe Satavahana kings did not bear high-sounding titles; rather they were simply called\u00a0Rajan. Maharaja was rarely used.\n\nThe ruler appointed several ministers & executive officers to assist him in administration.\n\nThe officers in the king\u2019s ministry were called\u00a0Raj-amatyas.\nBesides, other officers mentioned in the inscription were:\u00a0Senapati(the Army Commander),\u00a0Rajjuka\u00a0(the Revenue Officer),\u00a0Bhandagarika\u00a0(the Treasurer),\u00a0Paniyagharika\u00a0(the Superintendent of Water Works),\u00a0Karmantika\u00a0(the Superintendent of Public Works) &\u00a0Avesanika\u00a0(the foreman).\nEconomy\n\nThey were known for their active trade and commerce, especially in the maritime trade routes that connected the Deccan to the western coast and other parts of the world.\n\nThe income of the state under the Satavahanas was derived from land revenue and other cesses, taxes levied on commodities, excise duties, fines imposed on offenders, and other means. Some portion of income was also derived from State-owned lands.\nInscriptions make no mention of the crops produced in the Satavahana age but some crops like rice, wheat, sugar, jawar, bajra, and cotton were mentioned in the Gathasaptasati.\n\nThe dynasty controlled key trade routes, contributing to their economic prosperity.\n\nMaritime trade was flourishing from the ports of Broach, Kalyan, and Sopara.\nIndian ship on lead coin of\u00a0Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi was the testimony to the naval, seafaring, and trading capabilities of the Satavahanas during the 1st\u20132nd century CE.\nThe Satavahanas carried on a flourishing trade with foreign countries like Egypt and Greece.\nThe exports included sesame oil, sugar, animal skins, cotton fabrics, silk, muslin, jewels, ornaments, etc. The goods imported were Roman wine, copper, tin, lead, and glass among many others.\n\nThe Satavahanas were the first kings to produce coins bearing their names in South India.\n\nVarious types of copper, lead, and potash coins were in use throughout the Satavahana era.\nThe Naneghat inscription makes reference to karshapanas, which stands for a currency made of copper and silver. However, the coins from this time period were likely composed of copper.\nSeveral coins with punch marks have been discovered during Kondapur excavations. Additionally, there were gold coins in use.\nSatavahana Dynasty: Culture, Art, and Architecture\n\nThe Satavahanas were patrons of art and culture, and their rule saw the development of distinctive architectural styles.\n\nThey supported Buddhist and Hindu religious establishments, resulting in the construction of numerous stupas, chaityas (prayer halls), and viharas (monastic complexes).\n\nThe famous Amaravati Stupa is one of the finest examples of their architectural contributions.\nThe southern gateway of the Great Stupa at\u00a0Sanchi was, according to an inscription, donated under the rule of \u201cKing Satakarni\u201d, probably Satakarni II.\nTemples were built or Gauri, and vratas of fire and water.\n\nThe Mahabharata is said to have been written as we see it today during the Satavahana period.\n\nThe most intriguing practice instituted by the Satavahanas was that of metronymic, i.e., the name of emperors was often derived from the female lineage. This is particularly evident through names like Gautami-putra and Vaishishti-putra.\n\nHowever, it is hard to conclude whether the Satavahana society was matriarchal or matrilineal.\nHowever, it sheds some light on women\u2019s status at that time, which may have been far superior to what it was in other parts of the country.\nReligious Patronage\n\nThe dynasty showed a blend of both Hindu and Buddhist religious inclinations.\n\nSome rulers, like Gautamiputra Satakarni, are known for their patronage of Buddhism, while others supported Brahmanical practices.\n\nThe inscriptions suggest that they were influenced by the Vedic practices- the Naneghat inscription records queen Naganika performing Vedic sacrifices with her husband Satakarni I.\n\nIt also mentions the names of various sacrifices performed by the rulers: Agnyadheya, Anvarambhaniya, Angarika, Asvamedhas, and Gavamayana, among many others.\n\nDecline of the Satavahana dynasty\n\nThe exact reasons for the decline of the Satavahana dynasty are not definitively known, but, likely, factors like internal conflicts, foreign invasions, and shifts in trade routes contributed to their downfall.\n\nBy around the 3rd century CE, their prominence waned, and the dynasty gradually lost control over their territories.\nThe Satavahanas were followed by Abhiras in Maharashtra, Kadambas in Mysore, Vakatakas in the Deccan, and Bruhatpalayanas in Andhra Pradesh.\nLater, the Vishnukundins and Chalukyas emerged and became dominant in the region that had earlier been in the possession of the Satavahanas.\n\nThe Satavahana dynasty left a significant impact on Indian history, contributing to regional development, trade, art, and religious practices. They are remembered as an important indigenous dynasty that played a role in the transition from the Mauryan period to the subsequent historical phases of India.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

He unified various Central Asian tribes and established the early foundation of the empire.\nVima Takto (80-105 CE): Vima Takto expanded the Kushan Empire\u2019s territory into northern India and established its presence in the Indian subcontinent.\nKanishka I (127-150 CE): Kanishka I is one of the most famous and significant Kushan rulers. He expanded the empire further into India and is known for his support of Buddhism. The Fourth Buddhist Council, which aimed to codify Buddhist scriptures, was held during his reign.\nHuvishka (150-180 CE): Huvishka continued the expansion of the empire and supported both Buddhism and Zoroastrianism. He is associated with the construction of various Buddhist monasteries and stupas.\nVasudeva I (190-230 CE): Vasudeva I ruled during a period of both territorial expansion and internal challenges for the Kushan Empire. His reign marked the decline of Kushan power in some regions.\nVasudeva II (230-250 CE): Vasudeva II ruled during a time when the Kushan Empire was facing external pressures from the Sassanian Empire and internal divisions.\n\nSeveral \u201cLittle Kushans\u201d are known, who ruled locally in the area of Punjab with their capital at Taxila after territory losses in the west (Bactria lost to the Kushano-Sasanians) and in the east (Mathura lost to the Gupta Empire).\n\nThese rulers include Vasudeva II (270\u2013300 CE), Mahi (300\u2013305 CE), Shaka (305\u2013335 CE), and Kipunada (335\u2013350 CE). They were probably vassals of the Gupta Empire up to the Kidarite invasion when the final vestiges of Kushan rule were obliterated.\n\nCultural and Religious influence\n\nThe Kushan rulers are notable for their support of diverse religions, including Buddhism and Zoroastrianism, as well as for their role in facilitating trade and cultural exchange along the Silk Road. Their rule left a lasting impact on the history and culture of Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe Kushan Empire was known for its cultural diversity, reflecting the interactions between various ethnic and cultural groups in the region.\nThe empire was a melting pot of different religions, including Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, and elements of Greek and Persian belief systems.\n\nA multiethnic community accepting of religious diversity was found in the Gandhara area, the heart of the Kushan empire.\n\nGandhara, which had been conquered several times and was governed by the Mauryans, Alexander the Great (327-324 BCE), his Indo-Greek successors (3rd-2nd centuries BCE), and a confederation of Scythians and Parthians (2nd-1st centuries BCE), was sought after for its strategic location, direct access to the overland silk routes, and connections to the ports on the Arabian Sea.\nThe mixing of the many peoples resulted in a varied civilization, which was reflected in the Kushan period\u2019s visual arts.\nThemes from Greek and Roman myths were prevalent at first, but subsequently, Buddhist iconography predominated.\nThe first portrayals of bodhisattvas and the Buddha in human form belong to the Kushan era.\nArt and Architecture\n\nThe Kushan period saw the development of a unique artistic style that combined elements from Greek, Persian, Indian, and Central Asian traditions.\n\nThe Gandhara school of art flourished under Kushan patronage, producing sculptures and art that blended Hellenistic and Indian influences.\nThe Kushans also created elaborate coins with bilingual inscriptions in Greek and Bactrian, highlighting their multicultural nature.\nThe Kushan Empire\u2019s connections with the Hellenistic world led to a fusion of Greek and Buddhist artistic elements.\nThis is evident in sculptures that blend Greek-inspired realism with Buddhist symbolism. For example, the portrayal of Buddha with curly hair and wearing a Greek-style toga-like robe.\n\nThe Mathura region (in present-day northern India) was another significant artistic center during the Kushan era.\n\nThe Mathura School of Art focused on creating sculptures in native Indian styles, emphasizing emotion and spiritual depth in representations of deities, including Buddha and various Hindu gods.\nWhile Buddhism was a prominent religion, the Kushan period also witnessed the emergence of Hindu art, particularly in the Mathura region.\nHindu deities like Shiva and Vishnu were represented in sculptures and reliefs.\n\nThe Kushan period saw the development of Buddhist architecture, including stupas, viharas (monasteries), and chaityas (prayer halls).\n\nThe Great Stupa at Sanchi, originally built during the Mauryan period, was expanded and renovated under Kushan\u2019s influence.\n\nThe Kushan rulers issued a diverse range of gold, silver, and copper coins. These coins often featured portraits of the rulers on the obverse side and various deities and symbols on the reverse side.\n\nTrade and Connectivity\n\nThe Kushan Empire was strategically located along the Silk Road, a network of trade routes connecting the East and West.\n\nThis position facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures between Asia, the Mediterranean, and beyond.\n\nThe empire\u2019s prosperity was closely tied to its role in facilitating trade and cultural interactions.\n\nThe Silk Road facilitated the movement of a wide range of goods, including silk, spices, precious metals, gemstones, textiles, ceramics, and more.\nTrade along the Silk Road wasn\u2019t solely about material goods. The movement of people, traders, scholars, and travelers also led to the exchange of cultural ideas, religious beliefs, languages, and technologies.\n\nApart from the overland Silk Road, the Kushan Empire also engaged in maritime trade with regions around the Indian Ocean. Ports like Bharuch and Kalyan were crucial centers for trade with the Roman Empire, Southeast Asia, and East Africa.\n\nThe Kushan Empire was known for exporting precious goods like gems, textiles, spices, and fragrances to the western regions. In return, they imported Roman glassware, wines, and other luxury items.\n\nKushan coins, known for their artistic quality, served not only as a medium of exchange but also as indicators of trade routes and interactions. The bilingual inscriptions on the coins, often in Greek and a local language, demonstrate the diverse linguistic influences of the era.\n\nDecline of the Kushan Empire\n\nThe Kushan Empire faced internal strife, external invasions, and political challenges, which contributed to its gradual decline.\n\nBy the mid-3rd century CE, the empire fragmented into various regional kingdoms.\nDespite its decline, the legacy of the Kushan Empire continued to influence the region\u2019s cultural and religious development.\n\nThe Kushan Empire\u2019s cultural and historical significance lies in its ability to bridge diverse cultures and facilitate exchanges across a vast geographical area. Its legacy can be seen in the art, architecture, and religious practices that developed during its time, as well as its contribution to the broader historical narrative of Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

He was a skilled military strategist and leader.\n\nChandragupta\u2019s rise to power began with his alliance with Chanakya, also known as Kautilya, who played a crucial role in his political and military strategies.\nChandragupta overthrew the Nanda dynasty, which ruled the Magadha region and established his capital at Pataliputra (modern-day Patna).\nHe followed an aggressive expansion policy. He defeated the Indo-Greek king Seleucus Nicator and married his daughter.\n\nChandragupta\u2019s son, Bindusara, succeeded him and continued to expand the empire. Bindusara is said to have extended the Mauryan Empire\u2019s influence to various regions in India.\n\nHowever, it was under Ashoka, Bindusara\u2019s son, that the Mauryan Empire reached its peak. Ashoka, also known as Ashoka the Great, expanded the empire to cover a vast territory, including most of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAshoka\u2019s expansion campaigns were marked by both military conquests and the propagation of Buddhism.\n\nThe Mauryan Empire expanded through a combination of military conquest and strategic diplomacy. Ashoka\u2019s wins included the annexation of the Kalinga region (modern-day Odisha) after a brutal war.\n\nAshoka\u2019s approach to governance transformed the Kalinga War. He adopted a policy of non-violence (ahimsa) and embraced Buddhism, advocating for the welfare and moral upliftment of his subjects.\n\nRulers of the Mauryan empire\nChandragupta Maurya (322 BCE \u2013 298 BCE): Chandragupta Maurya founded the Mauryan Empire by overthrowing the Nanda dynasty. He was guided by his mentor, Chanakya (also known as Kautilya), a renowned political strategist. Chandragupta\u2019s reign saw the expansion of the empire, and he established an efficient administrative system. After ruling for about 25 years, Chandragupta abdicated in favor of his son, Bindusara, and became a Jain monk.\nBindusara (298 BCE \u2013 273 BCE): Bindusara, the son of Chandragupta Maurya, continued his father\u2019s expansion policies. He extended the empire\u2019s boundaries further south into the Deccan region.\nAshoka the Great (273 BCE \u2013 232 BCE): Ashoka, also known as Ashoka the Great, is one of the most famous Mauryan emperors. Initially, he ruled through military conquests, but the Kalinga War in 261 BCE had a profound impact on him. After the war, he embraced Buddhism and adopted a policy of non-violence. He is known for his rock edicts, which spread his message of dharma (righteousness) and social welfare.\nDasaratha Maurya (232 BCE \u2013 224 BCE): Dasaratha was the son of Ashoka. His reign marked a period of relative stability and continuation of Ashoka\u2019s policies.\nSamprati (224 BCE \u2013 215 BCE): Samprati was a grandson of Ashoka and is believed to have continued Ashoka\u2019s emphasis on Buddhism and welfare measures.\nSalisuka (215 BCE \u2013 202 BCE): Salisuka\u2019s rule saw the decline of the Mauryan Empire, with several provinces breaking away.\nDevavarman (202 BCE \u2013 195 BCE): Devavarman\u2019s reign marked a period of further disintegration of the empire.\nShatadhanvan (195 BCE \u2013 187 BCE): Shatadhanvan was one of the last rulers of the Mauryan Empire, and his rule saw further decline and weakening of the empire.\nBrihadratha (187 BCE- 184 BCE): He was the last Mauryan ruler and was assassinated by Pushyamitra Shunga, his commander-in-chief.\nEconomy, Administration, and Military\n\nTrade and enterprise were public-private affairs- the state could own and engage in business activities just like ordinary citizens could.\n\nThe royal revenue was drawn from taxes and the state had a monopoly over coinage, mining, salt production, arms manufacture, and boat building.\n\nFarmers comprised the most significant part of the population, and agriculture was taxed.\nTradespeople were organized into guilds that held both executive and judicial authority and also functioned as banks.\nCraftspeople engaged in a particular industry tended to live together.\nGoods could not be sold at the place where they were produced; they had to be brought to specific markets.\nTolls were collected for roads and river crossings, and goods sold within the kingdom were taxed, as were imports and exports.\nThe state fixed the wholesale price of goods and inspected weights and measures.\nBarter was prevalent, as were gold, bronze, and copper coins. Money was lent on interest against promissory notes.\nAdministration\n\nThe Mauryan Empire is known for its sophisticated administrative and bureaucratic systems. Ashoka established a system of dhamma (moral law) and sent edicts engraved on pillars and rocks throughout his empire to communicate his policies.\n\nThe Mauryan Empire had a highly centralized administrative system with a well-defined hierarchy of officials reporting to the king.\nThe administration was divided into several levels, starting with the king at the top. The king was assisted by various officials who were responsible for different aspects of governance.\nThe empire was divided into provinces or territories known as \u201cJanapadas\u201d or \u201cMahajanapadas.\u201d Each section was governed by a royal prince or a trusted administrator. They were responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and implementing royal orders.\nBelow the provincial level, districts known as \u201cVishayas\u201d were governed by officials responsible for taxation, administration, and maintaining peace.\nThe empire\u2019s revenue system included land taxes and various other forms of taxation. Land revenue was a significant source of income for the empire.\nThe Mauryan administration conducted periodic censuses to assess population and economic resources. Ashoka\u2019s inscriptions on pillars and rocks provided information about administration, moral values, and social welfare measures.\nThe administration included a judicial system to ensure justice. Ashoka\u2019s edicts emphasized the importance of justice, fair governance, and the welfare of his subjects.\nMilitary\n\nThe Mauryan Empire maintained a well-organized and powerful military to protect its territories and expand its boundaries.\n\nIt included infantry (foot soldiers), cavalry (horse-mounted soldiers), and war elephants. Elephants were a formidable force and played a crucial role in battles.\nThe use of war elephants was a significant military advantage for the Mauryans. These elephants were trained for combat and were used to break enemy formations.\nMegasthenes mentions military command consisting of six boards of five members each- Navy, military transport, Infantry, Cavalry with Catapults, Chariot divisions, and Elephants.\n\nAfter the Kalinga War, Emperor Ashoka adopted policies of non-violence and focused on spreading Buddhism and Dhamma (righteousness) rather than further expansion through military conquest.\n\nThe king\u2019s army was not disbanded even after the king, Ashoka, gave up war.\n\nArt and Architecture\n\nMuch of the Mauryan architecture and art has been lost due to the passage of time, and our understanding is based on archaeological remains, inscriptions, and descriptions from ancient texts. The Mauryan Empire played a significant role in shaping the artistic and architectural traditions of ancient India, particularly in the context of Buddhism and its visual representation.\n\nThe architecture of the Mauryan period was marked by the use of wood and other perishable materials, which have not survived. However, descriptions in ancient texts provide some insights. Palace structures and other buildings were likely constructed using wooden columns, beams, and thatch roofs.\n\nPillars and Edicts: The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (268-232 BCE) is particularly known for his stone pillars and edicts. These pillars were erected at various locations across the empire and carried inscriptions in Brahmi script. They provided information about Ashoka\u2019s policies, his conversion to Buddhism, and his efforts towards promoting moral and ethical values.\n\nThe Sarnath Lion Capital is a famous example of Mauryan art and is now the national emblem of India. It features four lions back-to-back, symbolizing dharma, and was placed atop an Ashoka Pillar.\n\nStupas: Stupas are sacred structures associated with Buddhism. During the Mauryan period, the construction of stupas gained prominence. The most famous stupa of this time is the Great Stupa at Sanchi, which was initially commissioned by Ashoka and later enlarged. It has a simple hemispherical shape and houses relics of the Buddha.\n\nArtistic Motifs: Artistic motifs of the Mauryan era often depicted animals, plants, and geometric designs. The use of these motifs can be seen in sculptures, particularly those associated with pillars and stupas.\n\nPolished Stone Sculptures: Polished stone sculptures, including figurines and decorative elements, were produced during the Mauryan period. These sculptures displayed a level of artistic skill and craftsmanship.\n\nAlso read: Arts of the Mauryan Period\n\nDecline and Disintegration of the Mauryan Empire\n\nAfter Ashoka\u2019s death, the Mauryan Empire began to decline due to factors like succession disputes, economic challenges, and external pressures.\n\nThe last Mauryan King Brihadratha was overthrown and assassinated by Pushyamitra Shunga, the commander-in-chief of Mauryan Imperial forces and a Brahmin, who then established the Shunga dynasty.\n\nBy the mid-2nd century BCE, the Mauryan Empire disintegrated, leading to the rise of regional kingdoms in different parts of India.\n\nThe Mauryan Empire\u2019s founding and expansion had a profound impact on Indian history and culture. It established a template for centralized governance, administration, and the dissemination of ethical and moral principles.\n\nAshoka\u2019s conversion to Buddhism and his emphasis on non-violence continue to be important elements of India\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Read further to know more.\u00a0\n\nThe Indian Independence Act of 1947 stands as a monumental legislative landmark that marked the end of British colonial rule in India and paved the way for the birth of two sovereign nations, India and Pakistan.\n\nEnacted by the British Parliament, this act is not merely a legal document; it is a testimony to the long-fought struggle for freedom, the complexities of partition, and the challenges that emerged in the wake of independence.\n\nThe Indian Independence Act of 1947, was significant because it allowed the Crown to transfer sovereignty to India amicably. It was approved by the British Parliament on July 5 and received royal assent on July 18.\n\nOn June 3, 1947, Viceroy of India Lord Louis Mountbatten and Prime Minister of Britain Clement Attlee developed a plan to divide the British Indian colonies into India and Pakistan after consulting with the key players\u2014the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, and representatives of the Sikh community.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBackground and Context\nKey Details of the Indian Independence Act\nSignificance of the Indian Independence Act-\nConclusion: Legacy and Impact\nBackground and Context\n\nThe roots of the Indian Independence Act can be traced back to the formation of the Indian National Congress in the late 19th century. Over the years, the struggle for independence gained momentum, culminating in events like the Non-Cooperation Movement, Civil Disobedience Movement, and Quit India Movement.\n\nThe British colonial administration, burdened by the aftermath of World War II and growing nationalist sentiments, recognized the need to address India\u2019s quest for self-governance. In 1947, Lord Louis Mountbatten was appointed as the last Viceroy of India, with a mandate to oversee the transfer of power from British rule to Indian leadership.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAmidst escalating communal tensions and demands for separate Muslim representation, the demand for partition became unavoidable. The Indian Independence Act was thus introduced to provide a legal framework for the partition and the eventual transfer of power.\n\nKey Details of the Indian Independence Act\n\nNow let us look into the most significant details of the Indian Independence Act:\n\n1. Partition and Creation of India and Pakistan: The Indian Independence Act, introduced on July 4, 1947, proposed the partition of British India into two dominions \u2013 India and Pakistan. The act granted full legislative authority to both dominions, allowing them to frame their own constitutions and determine their governance structures.\n\n2. Boundary Demarcation: The act laid out the territorial boundaries for India and Pakistan, with special provisions for regions with a significant Muslim population. The exact division of provinces between the two new nations was carried out by a boundary commission led by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, whose decisions had far-reaching consequences, leading to mass migrations and communal violence.\n\n3. Governance Structures: The act outlined the framework for each dominion\u2019s government. The two dominions were given the option to adopt the Government of India Act of 1935 as their interim constitution, with provisions for making modifications as needed. The monarch of Great Britain continued to be the shared head of state for both dominions until India became a republic in 1950.\n\n4. Citizenship and Minority Rights: The act addressed the issue of citizenship, allowing people to choose their citizenship based on their place of residence. However, the protection of minority rights remained a concern, leading to the formulation of safeguards for minorities in both dominions. These safeguards, though intended to ensure the rights of minorities, couldn\u2019t prevent widespread violence and displacement during partition.\n\n5. Financial and Military Arrangements: The division of assets and liabilities between India and Pakistan was a critical aspect of the act. The two nations agreed on financial settlements and the division of the military, but the partition left behind many unresolved issues that continued to impact relations between the two nations.\n\nSignificance of the Indian Independence Act-\nIt declared India to be a sovereign and independent state.\nIt called for the partition of India and the establishment of two new dominions, India and Pakistan.\nIt did away with the position of Secretary of State for India.\nIt eliminated the role of the viceroy and established a governor-general for each dominion, to be selected by the British King on the advice of the dominion cabinet.\nIt gave the constituent assemblies of the two dominions the authority to draught and adopt any constitution for their separate states and repeal any act of the British parliament, including the Independence Act itself.\nThe constituent assemblies were given the authority to legislate for their separate dominions until new constitutions were created and implemented.\nConclusion: Legacy and Impact\n\nThe Indian Independence Act of 1947 marks the culmination of decades of struggle, sacrifice, and perseverance by countless Indians who aspired for self-governance and freedom from British colonial rule.\n\nWhile it brought about the desired end of British rule, the act also left behind a legacy of partition-related turmoil that shaped the political, social, and cultural landscapes of both India and Pakistan.\n\nThe act\u2019s impact on the region has been profound and enduring. The partition, accompanied by large-scale migrations and communal violence, resulted in the deaths of an estimated one to two million people and the displacement of millions more. Families were uprooted, homes were lost, and the scars of partition continue to affect generations even today.\n\nThe act\u2019s provisions for minority rights were well-intentioned, but they couldn\u2019t prevent the tragic events that unfolded. The communal violence and the displacement of populations remain a reminder of the challenges that arise when drawing boundaries based on religious and ethnic lines.\n\nThe ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan, rooted in their shared history and territorial disputes, underscore the complexities of the partition and its aftermath.\n\nFurthermore, the Indian Independence Act set the stage for the development of the two nations\u2019 constitutions and governance structures. While India embraced a democratic and secular framework, Pakistan initially defined itself as an Islamic state. These foundational choices continue to shape the political trajectories of both countries.\n\nIn conclusion, the Indian Independence Act of 1947 holds a pivotal place in the annals of history. It signifies the end of an era of colonialism and the beginning of a new chapter for India and Pakistan.\n\nThe act\u2019s legacy is complex, marked by both the triumph of independence and the tragedy of partition. It serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding the historical context, complexities, and consequences of significant legislative actions that shape the course of nations and the lives of millions.\n\nArticle written by: Arya P J\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"

The areas of Gandhara (northwestern Pakistan) and the Punjab region were particularly significant.\n\nProminent Indo-Greek rulers\n\nSeveral Greek rulers established their rule in different parts of northern India during this period. Some of the prominent rulers included Demetrius I, Menander I, Eucratides I, and Strato I. Each ruler controlled varying territories and played a role in shaping the political landscape.\n\nMENANDER I\n\nIn 165 BCE, the Greco-Bactrian rebel Eucratides invaded the Indo-Greek kingdoms and, defeating Antimachos II, succeeded to take control of most of the Indo-Greek possessions.\n\nBut Menander I defeated and pushed him back to Bactria in 155 BCE.\nMenander extended Greek rule as far as Paliputra (today, Patna)\n\nFrom 165 BCE until he died in 130 BCE, Menander I ruled Punjab with Sagala as his capital.\n\nMenander is also remembered in Buddhist literature, where he is called Milinda, and is described in the Milinda Panha as a convert to Buddhism.\n\nHere is a list of some of the prominent Indo-Greek rulers:\n\nDiodotus I: The founder of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, which was a precursor to the Indo-Greek Kingdoms.\nDemetrius I (c. 205\u2013171 BCE): Also known as Demetrius I of Bactria, he established the Indo-Greek Kingdom in parts of northwestern India.\nMenander I (c. 165\u2013130 BCE): One of the most well-known Indo-Greek rulers, he is often associated with his conversion to Buddhism.\nApollodotus I (c. 180\u2013160 BCE): He ruled in the northwestern Indian region of Gandhara and issued coins with both Greek and Indian influences.\nAntimachus I (c. 180\u2013165 BCE): Another ruler in Gandhara, his coins display a mix of Greek and Indian styles.\nEucratides I (c. 171\u2013145 BCE): Eucratides expanded the Indo-Greek territories into Bactria and the northern regions of India.\nMenander II (c. 90 BCE): Also known as Menander II Soter, he ruled in the northwestern Indian region of Punjab.\nHeliokles II (c. 125 BCE): Heliokles ruled parts of northern India during the same period as Menander II.\nStrato I (c. 130\u2013110 BCE): He ruled in the region of Punjab and was known for his coins depicting a variety of deities.\nHermaeus (c. 90 BCE): Hermaeus ruled in the area of Kapisa in modern-day Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India.\nHippostratos (c. 65 BCE): Hippostratos ruled in the region of Punjab and issued coins that showcased both Greek and Indian features.\nTelephos (c. 75 BCE): Little is known about Telephos, but his coins provide some historical insights.\nDionysios (c. 65 BCE): Dionysios ruled in the region of Punjab and his coins reflect a fusion of Greek and Indian cultures.\nPhiloxenos (c. 100 BCE): Philoxenos ruled in the region of Punjab and his coins are characterized by their unique iconography.\nAmyntas (c. 100 BCE): Amyntas ruled in the region of Kabul and his coins often featured Greek and Indian deities.\n\nIn 80 BCE, the Saka king Maues attacked the Indo-Greek kingdoms. He won against several Euthydemid and Eucratid kings, taking the Paropamisadae, Gandhara, and Western Punjab.\n\nOver time, the Indo-Greek Kingdoms faced challenges from various factors, including internal conflicts, pressures from neighboring empires like the Parthians and the Kushans, and the gradual reassertion of indigenous Indian rule.\n\nEnd of the Indo-Greek Kingdom\n\nBy the 1st century CE, the Indo-Greek Kingdoms had largely disintegrated, and their territories were absorbed by other empires.\n\nThe last Indo-Greek king Strato II ended his rule circa 10 BCE, defeated by the Indo-Saka king Rajuvula.\n\nThe expansion of the Kushan Empire and the rise of the Gupta Empire marked the decline of the Indo-Greek presence in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nInfluence of Indo-Greek Culture\n\nThe Indo-Greek Kingdom represents a fusion of Greek and Indian cultures, often referred to as Hellenistic culture.\n\nThis period saw the interaction and blending of Greek customs, art, and administrative practices with Indian traditions.\n\nThe Indo-Greek Kingdoms facilitated a cross-cultural exchange between Greece and India. Greek artistic styles influenced local art, and elements of Indian religious and philosophical thought may have influenced Greek rulers.\nSome Indo-Greek rulers, such as Menander I, are known to have converted to Buddhism. This further contributed to the blending of Greek and Indian religious practices.\nIndo-Greek architecture is not as well-documented as their art, but there is evidence of Greek influence in certain structural elements, such as column design and the use of Corinthian capitals in some buildings.\n\nIndo-Greek rulers issued a significant number of coins, which provide valuable historical and artistic insights. Bilingual inscriptions, written in Greek and local scripts, are also important sources of information.\n\nCoins circulated to the north of the Hindu Kush region during the rule of Indo-Greeks: There were gold, silver, copper, and nickel coins with Greek legends. The Indo-Greek coins had royal portraits on the obverse and Greek deities (Zeus, Apollo, and Athena) on the reverse.\nCoins circulated to the south of the Hindu Kush region during the rule of Indo-Greeks: There were silver and copper coins (mostly in square shape). Indian weight standards were followed in the making of these coins. They had bilingual inscriptions \u2013 Greek and Kharoshthi. On the obverse of the coin, royal portraits were present and, on the reverse, religious symbols (mostly Indian in inspiration) were present.\n\nOne of the most notable outcomes of the Indo-Greek cultural exchange is the Gandhara School of Art.\n\nCentered in the Gandhara region (modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan), this school combined Greek techniques with Indian themes to create distinctive sculptures and reliefs.\nSculptures from the Indo-Greek period reflect a mixture of Greek naturalism and Indian sensibilities.\nGreek influences are seen in the rendering of human anatomy, while Indian features are evident in the portrayal of clothing, hairstyles, and facial expressions.\n\nThe Indo-Greek Kingdoms played a significant role in shaping the cultural and historical landscape of the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent during their existence.\n\nWhile their rule was relatively short-lived, their legacy continues to be reflected in historical records, coins, and artifacts that provide insights into the interactions between Greek and Indian cultures during ancient times.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

The Indian National Congress, under leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Subhas Chandra Bose, had been championing the cause of independence, demanding greater self-governance for the Indian people.\n\nThe Quit India Movement of 1942 marked a high point in this struggle, as Indians across the nation united to demand the British departure from India.\n\nIndian National Congress\u2019s Stand\n\nThe Indian National Congress, the foremost political organization representing Indian aspirations, was steadfast in its pursuit of complete independence. The Congress\u2019s leadership recognized that Indian participation in the war effort could not come at the cost of their long-standing demand for self-governance.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndia condemned Nazi aggression but asserted that India could not be a party to the war, apparently fighting for democratic freedom when India herself was denied the same. If Britain was fighting for democracy and freedom it should be proved by ending its imperial rule in its colonies and establishing full democracy in India.\n\nThey demanded that the British government should declare its war aims and how the principles of democracy were to be applied to India after the war.\n\nThe Quit India Movement was a testament to the Indian people\u2019s collective will to break free from the shackles of colonial rule.\n\nEvents Leading to the August Offer:\n\nAmidst this backdrop, the British government dispatched Sir Stafford Cripps to India in March 1942. Cripps, a member of the War Cabinet, was entrusted with a significant task \u2013 to secure Indian support for the war effort in exchange for promises of future self-governance.\n\nHis mission, which came to be known as the Cripps Mission or the August Offer, was an attempt to address India\u2019s growing demands for freedom.\n\nTerms and Conditions of the August Offer:\n\nThe August Offer presented a series of propositions that sought to strike a balance between British interests and Indian aspirations:\n\n1. Dominion Status: One of the most significant aspects of the offer was the promise of a post-war Indian Dominion within the British Commonwealth. This envisioned India as a fully autonomous nation, with control over its internal affairs.\n\n2. Constituent Assembly: The offer proposed the formation of a constituent assembly after the war, tasked with drafting a new Indian constitution. This constitution would determine the nature of India\u2019s relationship with the British Commonwealth.\n\n3. Minority Protections: The August Offer included provisions to protect the rights of minorities in the future Indian state. This addressed concerns raised by various communities about their representation and safeguarding of their interests.\n\nCongress was utterly disappointed with the entitled dominion status and they demanded complete independence. They rejected the August Offer.\n\nMuslim League initially accepted the August Offer because it offered a veto power to the minorities in framing the constitution but later ended up rejecting the offer.\n\nSignificance of the August Offer:\n\nThe August Offer marked a significant departure from the British government\u2019s previous attitudes towards Indian demands for self-governance.\n\nFor the first time, the British acknowledged the inevitability of India\u2019s eventual independence and demonstrated a willingness to engage in serious negotiations. The offer itself, however, was met with mixed reactions in India.\n\nWhile some sections of the Indian National Congress viewed it as a potential stepping stone towards independence, others were skeptical of the vague timelines and conditions. The Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, expressed reservations regarding the protection of Muslim rights within a future Indian state.\n\nLegacy and Impact:\n\nUltimately, the August Offer did not lead to immediate breakthroughs or significant concessions from either side. It did, however, set the stage for further negotiations and discussions between Indian leaders and the British government.\n\nThe failure of the August Offer to gain widespread acceptance contributed to increased disillusionment within the Indian National Congress and the further hardening of attitudes.\n\nThe Cripps Mission and the August Offer were part of a series of events that ultimately led to the post-war transition towards India\u2019s independence. The Indian Independence Act of 1947 paved the way for the partition of the Indian subcontinent and the birth of two independent nations, India and Pakistan.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe August Offer remains a crucial episode in India\u2019s journey towards self-governance. It serves as a reminder of the complexities of negotiations, the evolving dynamics between the Indian leadership and the British government, and the relentless spirit of a nation in pursuit of its rightful place in the world.\n\nWhile the August Offer itself did not lead to immediate breakthroughs, its legacy lives on as part of the larger narrative of India\u2019s struggle for independence and its eventual emergence as a free and sovereign nation.\n\nAlso read: Jawaharlal Nehru: The Architect of Modern India\n\nArticle written by Arya P J."

Yudhisthir, the Pandava prince, cleared the forest known as Khandavavan and established the city, Indraprastha, in Delhi.\nIndeed, it was a formidable city so grand that it made Kauravas the enemies of Pandavas. From that period Delhi witnessed the rise and fall of many dynasties and Empires.\nThe location of the city attracted Indian rulers of all kinds from ancient times because of its strategic and commercial value.\n\nIt would be easy to argue that the cities of Delhi were in reality less or more than seven. But the accepted number is seven (excluding New Delhi) and these are cities whose remains are extant.\n\nHistorians speak of the \u201cSeven Cities of Delhi\u201d but, between 1100 CE and 1947 CE, there have been eight of them:\n\nIndraprastha- the oldest city\nSiri\nTughlqabad\nJahanpanah\nFirozobad\nThe city around Purana Qila\nShahjahanabad\nNew Delhi\n\nEach of these cities grew around the palace fortress of a particular dynasty and every dynasty wished to have a new headquarters for consideration of prestige.\n\nEven the Kings of the same dynasty had these ambitions and realized it if they had the means to do so.\nWith each successive reign, some distinctive architectural features were added or some change in urban morphology occurred.\nOften some important new buildings would rise, something monumental \u2013 whether a mosque or a tomb, a palace, a fortress, or a victory tower.\nThe Cities of Delhi in detail\n\nThe story of Delhi as the Capital of India began with the\u00a0Muslim\u00a0conquest of\u00a0Northern India at the end of the\u00a0twelfth century. Since then, with some interludes, it has been the seat of every central political authority.\n\nDelhi has served as the capital of several empires and dynasties, each contributing to its rich historical and cultural heritage.\n\nIndraprastha\n\nAccording to Hindu mythology, the city of Indraprastha believed to be around the present-day Purana Qila area, was founded by the Pandavas from the epic Mahabharata.\n\nThis city is mentioned in ancient texts like the Mahabharata and the Puranas.\nDuring the Mauryan period, Indraprastha was known as Indapatta in Buddhist literature.\nThe location of Indraprastha is uncertain but Purana Qila in present-day New Delhi is frequently cited.\nQila Rai Pithora\n\nThe city of Delhi saw its earliest historical beginnings during the rule of the Rajput Tomar dynasty.\n\nAnangpal Tomar founded Delhi or Lalkot in 1052. A Vikram Samvat 1383 inscription in Delhi Museum confirms the founding of Delhi by the Tomars.\n\nAnangpal Tomar is credited with establishing the city of Lal Kot, later renamed Qila Rai Pithora, around the 11th century.\n\nThe Chauhan kings of Ajmer conquered Lal Kot in 1180 and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora.\nThe Chauhan king Prithviraj III was defeated in 1192 by Muhammad Ghori in the Second Battle of Tarain, solidifying Muslim presence in northern India and shattering Rajput power in the Indo-Gangetic Plain.\nSiri\n\nThe establishment of the Delhi Sultanate marked a significant phase in the city\u2019s history.\n\nThe second city of Delhi during the Sultanate period, Siri, was built by Alauddin Khilji and expanded by subsequent rulers. It witnessed major historical events, including the Mongol invasions.\n\nHe constructed Siri between 1297 and 1307 to defend India and Delhi against Mongol raids. The Siri Fort had the appearance of a sizable Turkish castle.\nThe majority of buildings built during this period were Seljuk in design. As they fled Mongol incursions, craftsmen from the West Asian Sejuqian dynasty made contributions to the Delhi court\u2019s construction.\nThe Hauz Khas reservoir and long lengths of enormous stone walls serve as modern-day representations of the Siri fort.\nThe Hazar Sutan, a palace with 1,000 pillars inside the fort, was formerly regarded as the pride of the city. Its Darwaza (door) reportedly has elaborate decorations.\nThe eastern part of the remains includes bastions, slits for arrows, and flame-shaped battlements, all of which were considered to be remarkable new features at the time.\nBeyond the fort\u2019s walls, a palace was built with marble floors and other stone accents.\nLocal tyrants are blamed for demolishing the fort by stealing its stones, bricks, and other artifacts to use in their buildings.\nSiri provided the materials that Sher Shah Suri, a Pashtun Afghan from Bihar in Eastern India, used to construct his metropolis.\n\nSubsequent rulers expanded the city with other urban centers like Tughlaqabad, Jahanpanah, and Firozabad.\n\nTughlaqabad\n\nGhiyas-ud-din Tughlaq founded the fortified city of Tughlaqabad in the 14th century.\n\nIt was built with the intent of serving as a power center, but its ambitious construction and subsequent abandonment earned it the moniker \u201cCity of the Dead.\u201d\n\nThe hallmark of Tughlaq dynasty structures, sloping rubble-filled city walls, are fortified by circular bastions that can reach heights of up to two stories and are capped by battlemented parapets.\nThe walled city included seven rainwater tanks. The fort has a half-hexagonal form.\nMuch of the city is currently inaccessible because of the dense thorny vegetation.\nJahanpanah\n\nMohammad bin Tughlaq (son of Ghiyasudding Tugglaq) established Jahanpanah as his new capital, characterized by its well-planned layout and impressive architecture. Jahanpanah translates as \u201cWorld\u2019s Refuge.\u201d\n\nFirozabad\n\nFiroz Shah Tughlaq, known for his architectural endeavors, built Firozabad. He was responsible for constructing various monuments, including the famous Firoz Shah Kotla.\n\nIt was built in the second half of the 14th century near the Yamuna River.\nIt is a fortified enclosure with high walls that houses palaces, pillared rooms, mosques, a pigeon tower, and a water tank.\nAn Ashokan pillar is built on the Palace\u2019s roof. Firuz Shah also restored and repaired the Qutub Minar, the Sultan-e-Garhi Tomb of Nasiruddin Mahmood, and the Hauz Khas.\nShergarh or Purana Qila\n\nHumayun built the city of Dinpanah when he first took over the region from the Tughlaqs. But he was ousted by the Suri Dynasty in the Battle of Chausa and the Battle of Kannauj.\n\nSher Shah Suri demolished it and renamed it Shergarh or Dilli Sher Shahi. It is known as Purana Qila now.\n\nThe Western Gate is named Bada Darwaza and is flanked by powerful bastions; the Northern Gate is called Talaaqi Darwaza or the Forbidden Gate, and the Southern Gate is called Humayun Darwaza.\n\nThe Mughal Empire under Babur captured Delhi in 1526, marking the beginning of Mughal rule. Babur\u2019s successor, Humayun, and later Akbar established themselves in Delhi and Agra.\n\nShahjahanabad\n\nThe most famous Mughal city of Delhi, Shahjahanabad, was founded by Emperor Shah Jahan in the 17th century. It is the site of iconic monuments like the Red Fort and the Jama Masjid.\n\nIt is today known as Old Delhi.\n\nNew Delhi: Amalgamation of Cities of Delhi\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the British East India Company shifted the capital of British India from Calcutta to Delhi, marking the creation of \u201cNew Delhi\u201d as the new imperial capital.\n\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, Delhi was declared the capital of the Republic of India. The city has since grown into a major political, economic, cultural, and educational hub.\n\nConclusion\n\nThroughout its history, Delhi has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the construction of grand monuments, and the convergence of diverse cultures. Each phase has left an indelible mark on the city, making it a living testament to India\u2019s rich heritage and historical evolution.\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

Customs served as a source of law. This system continued till the Mughal period.\nMedieval period\n\nIn medieval India, the religious leaders endeavored to transform Islam into a religion of law, but as custodians of justice, the rulers made the Sharia, a court subservient to their sovereign power.\n\nTheoretically, the rulers had to be obedient to the Sharia and history speaks about certain cases where sovereigns unresistingly submitted to the Qazi\u2019s decision.\n\nEvery provincial capital and every large town had a Qazi.\nThe Qazis held the trial in the presence of the parties and were expected to write their legal documents very carefully.\nThe King was the highest court of appeal. The rulers sat in a Court known as Mazalim (complaints).\nAccording to Ibn Battuta, Muhammad bin Tughalaq, ruler of the Tughalaq dynasty, heard complaints each Monday and Thursday.\n\nFrom the 13th century onwards, an officer known as Amir-i- dad presided over the secular Court in the sultan\u2019s absence.\n\nHe was also responsible for implementing Qazis\u2019 decisions and for drawing their attention to the cases which constituted a miscarriage of justice.\n\nThe Muftis were the experts on Sharia law and gave Fatwas (formal legal rulings) on disputes referred to them by members of the public or qazis.\n\nThe Chief Judge of the sultanate was known as the qazi \u2013i- mamalik also known as the qazi- ul- quzat.\n\nDuring the Mughals period, the secular judge was known as Mir- adl. He acted as a judge on the emperor\u2019s behalf.\n\nHe was required to make impartial and personal inquiries. He was also responsible for implementing Qazi\u2019s decisions.\nEmperor Akbar also appointed two officers, called tui-begis, to supervise the adherence to the law and fixed a nominal amount as their fee.\nThe same system was followed till the British took over the power of India.\nColonial Era (17th to 20th Century)\n\nThe modern judicial system in India has its foundations in the colonial era. The East India Company established courts with European judges applying English law.\n\nThe British introduced the common law system in India and established the Sadar Diwani Adalat. They were later followed by the establishment of high courts.\nThe promulgation of Regulating Act of 1773 by the King of England paved the way for the establishment of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Calcutta.\nThe Supreme Courts at Madras and Bombay were established by King George III on 26 December 1800 and on 8 December 1823 respectively.\nThe establishment of the Calcutta High Court in 1862 marked a significant step in creating a formal legal framework and abolished Supreme Courts at Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay and also the Sadar Adalats in Presidency towns.\n\nIndian High Courts Act of 1861: This act established high courts in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras. These high courts became the apex courts in their respective regions, hearing appeals and original jurisdiction cases.\n\nGovernment of India Act, 1919: This act introduced reforms in the judicial system, including the separation of the judiciary from executive control. It also introduced the concept of diarchy, giving limited self-governance to provinces.\n\nGovernment of India Act, 1935: This act further expanded the powers and responsibilities of the provincial and central legislatures. It established the Federal Court of India as the highest court, with jurisdiction over constitutional matters.\n\nCoding of law also began in earnest with the forming of the first Law Commission.\n\nUnder the stewardship of its chairman, Thomas Babington Macaulay, the Indian Penal Code was drafted, enacted, and brought into force by 1862.\nThe Code of Criminal Procedure was also drafted by the same commission along with a host of other statutes and codes like the Evidence Act (1872) and the Contracts Act (1872).\nCulmination of the history of Indian Judiciary: Independence and Formation of the Supreme Court\n\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, the Constitution of India was adopted in 1950.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India was established as the highest court in the country, with the power of judicial review over legislative and executive actions.\n\nIn the 1980s, the judiciary expanded its role in social justice by allowing public interest litigation, enabling individuals and organizations to approach the courts to address issues affecting public interest.\n\nOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights.\n\nLandmark cases like Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) established the doctrine of basic structure and upheld the supremacy of the Constitution.\n\nThe Indian judiciary has undergone various reforms to improve efficiency, accessibility, and accountability.\n\nThe introduction of the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) was an attempt to reform the process of judicial appointments, though it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015.\n\nAlso read: Women in Judiciary\n\nModernization of Indian Judiciary\n\nAs a part of the National eGovernance Plan, the Government has launched the eCourts Mission Mode Project which is under implementation for ICT development of the District & Sub-ordinate courts in the country based on the \u201cNational Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology in the Indian Judiciary\u201d.\n\nIt is being implemented by the Department of Justice in association with the e-Committee Supreme Court of India.\nPhase I (2011-15) was aimed at the basic computerization of courts and providing local network connectivity was done.\nPhase II of the project started in 2015 for the installation of video conferencing infrastructure. 18,735 District and subordinate courts have been computerized till Phase II.\n\nIn the eCourts Project, the Government has taken the following initiatives to make justice accessible and available for all using technology:\n\nUnder the Wide Area Network (WAN) Project connectivity has been provided to 99.4% of total Court Complexes across India with 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps bandwidth speed.\nNational Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a database of orders, judgments, and cases, created as an online platform under the eCourts Project.\nCase Information Software (CIS) based on customized Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) has been developed.\nLive Streaming of court proceedings has been started in the High Courts of Gujarat, Gauhati, Orissa, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Patna, Madhya Pradesh &Constitutional Bench of Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India thus allowing media and other interested persons to join the proceedings.\n2 2 Virtual Courts in 18 States/UTs have been operationalized to handle traffic challan cases.\nA new e-filing system (version 3.0) has been rolled out for the electronic filing of legal papers with upgraded features.\ne-Filing of cases requires the option for electronic payment of fees which includes court fees, fines, and penalties which are directly payable to the Consolidated Fund.\nTo bridge the digital divide, 819 eSewa Kendras have been rolled out to facilitate the lawyer or litigant who needs any kind of assistance ranging from information to facilitation and eFiling.\nIn addition to eSewa Kendras, as part of the DISHA (Designing Innovative Solutions for Holistic Access to Justice) scheme the Government of India launched the Tele Law program in 2017, which provides an effective and reliable e-interface platform connecting the needy and disadvantaged sections seeking legal advice and consultation with panel lawyers via video conferencing, telephone, and chat facilities available at the Common Service Centres (CSCs) situated in Gram Panchayat and through Tele-Law mobile App.\nNational Service and Tracking of Electronic Processes (NSTEP) has been launched for technology-enabled process serving and issuing of summons.\n\nAlso read: Indianisation of Judiciary\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Indian judiciary continues to face challenges such as a backlog of cases, delays in justice delivery, and the need for judicial reforms.\n\nEfforts are being made to address these issues through technological advancements and systemic changes.\n\nAlso read:\n\nThe Union Judiciary i e.

These early seafaring peoples constructed simple boats and rafts for transportation, fishing, and trade along rivers and coastal waters.\n\nAncient Greeks and Romans\n\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans further advanced shipbuilding techniques, building larger and more sophisticated vessels for both trade and naval purposes.\nThe trireme, a type of ancient Greek warship with three rows of oars, is a notable example of their shipbuilding prowess.\n\nViking Age\n\nDuring the Viking Age (around the 8th to 11th centuries), the Norse people were renowned for their shipbuilding skills.\nThey constructed sturdy longships that allowed them to explore and raid distant lands across the North Atlantic and into Europe.\n\nAge of Exploration\n\nThe 15th and 16th centuries saw a significant expansion of shipbuilding due to the Age of Exploration.\nExplorers from Europe, such as Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, and Ferdinand Magellan, commissioned ships like caravels and carracks to undertake voyages of discovery, leading to the exploration and colonization of new continents.\n\nAge of Sail\n\nThe Age of Sail, which spanned from the 16th to the 19th centuries, saw the rise of powerful sailing ships like galleons, frigates, and clipper ships.\nThese vessels were crucial for trade, transportation, and naval warfare during the era of colonial expansion.\n\nIndustrial Revolution\n\nThe 19th century brought significant advancements in shipbuilding technology with the advent of the Industrial Revolution.\nIron and steel replaced wood as the primary shipbuilding materials, leading to the construction of more massive and stronger ships.\n\nSteam Power\n\nThe early 19th century saw the introduction of steam-powered ships, revolutionizing maritime transportation.\nSteam engines replaced sails as the main propulsion method, making long-distance travel more efficient and reliable.\n\nModern Shipbuilding\n\nThe 20th century marked a new era in shipbuilding, with the widespread use of internal combustion engines and the incorporation of advanced technologies.\nThe development of containerization revolutionized cargo shipping, making it more efficient and cost-effective.\n\nNaval Innovations\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, naval shipbuilding witnessed significant advancements, including the introduction of aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered submarines, and guided-missile destroyers.\nThese innovations have transformed naval warfare capabilities and strategic maritime power.\n\nPresent-day shipbuilding is characterized by advanced engineering, automation, and computer-aided design.\n\nSpecialized vessels, such as offshore oil platforms, LNG carriers, and luxury cruise ships, are built using cutting-edge technologies and materials.\n\nHistory of ship building in India\n\nThe history of shipbuilding in India dates back to ancient times, with a rich maritime heritage that spans several centuries.\n\nIndian shipbuilding skills were well-known and highly regarded in the ancient and medieval world, leading to significant maritime trade and exploration.\n\nAncient India\n\nAncient Indians were skilled shipbuilders and navigators. The Harappan civilization (around 2600-1900 BCE) had access to the Arabian Sea and the Indus River, facilitating maritime trade with neighboring regions.\n\nExcavations at Lothal, a major Harappan port city, have revealed the existence of a sophisticated dockyard with evidence of shipbuilding.\nA certain caste held a monopoly on the technology of shipbuilding, which was an inherited trade that was passed down from father to son.\nThe units of measurement utilized by the native builders were their hands, fingers, and feet.\nFlat-bottomed boats were designed to dock and service ships on both the big seas and domestic rivers. Around 60 tonnes of weight may be carried by these boats.\nAdditionally, the Harappans constructed a tidal dock for berthing and maintaining ships at port cities. This is seen to be a special development since it was the first tide dock ever built.\nThus, from 3000 BCE to 2000 BCE, India had a sophisticated civilization centered around shipbuilding.\n\nThe earlier Vedic period (2000-600 BCE) saw a slowdown from the advancement of the Harrapan culture and hence is called the dark age for ship building in India.\n\nThe later Vedic period (600-200 BCE) saw the revival of maritime activity.\n\nMaurya and Gupta Empires\n\nDuring the Maurya (322-185 BCE) and Gupta (320-550 CE) periods, India continued to be a significant maritime power. The Indian Ocean was a thriving network of trade routes, connecting India with Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.\n\nDuring the Mauryan Era, a Superintendent of Ships was appointed for the building and maintenance of boats.\nOcean-going ships capable of accommodating 700 passengers were built.\nThere are records of boats with up to 30 oars having been built in Punjab for Alexander\u2019s fleet implying that the shipbuilding culture had started taking shape during the Mauryan Era.\nPost-Gupta period had vessels with single, double, treble, and four masts also with as many sails, were built.\nThe wood used to build ships was mainly Malabar teak as it was found to be more durable than Oak which was used in other parts of the world to manufacture vessels.\n\nThe advent of sails\n\nMulti-oared ships were entirely overshadowed by sail ships.\n\nIn 756 CE, Pushyadeva, the king of Sindh, repulsed ferocious Arab Navy assaults, displaying the maritime prowess and superior shipbuilding skills of the period.\nThe historical work Yukti Kalpataru (1100 CE) addresses shipbuilding and goes into great detail about the many kinds of ships constructed at this time.\nBoats used for different tasks were referred to by distinct names, such as Samanya, Madhyawa, and Visesha for ferrying people across the river, hauling merchandise, and fishing.\nThe ships had excellent seaworthiness, could sail even at extremely high wind speeds, and could withstand the huge swell caused by cyclones.\n\nSince the Mauryan and Gupta times, the ships were mostly built at Calicut, Cochin, Kaveripattinam, Masulipatnam, and Calcutta.\n\nTwo types of ships were built \u2013 the Monoxylon and the Colandiophonto.\n\nThe Monoxylon, as the name suggests, was cut out of a single log to accommodate about 100 to 150 persons. It was raised with planks crossways to the ship in tiers. They were used in coastal traffic.\nThe Colandiophonto, however, were ocean-going vessels and were proportionately larger and sturdier weighing more than 1,000 tonnes.\n\nMedieval India\n\nIndian shipbuilding reached new heights during the medieval period. Arab and Chinese travelers documented India\u2019s flourishing maritime trade and advanced shipbuilding techniques.\n\nIndian ships, known as \u201cdhows,\u201d were used for both trade and naval purposes. These dhows were well-designed and efficient vessels, capable of navigating long distances across the Indian Ocean.\n\nThis period for the first time saw several Indian ships being built specifically for at-sea combat.\n\nThese Indian ships could fire incendiary throwers and catapults. The construction of warships in India changed when cannons were added to them when the Portuguese arrived in 1498 CE.\nThe Marathas also boosted the Indian shipbuilding sector. The Marathas established shipbuilding yards in Vijaydurg, Swarndur, and Kolaba throughout the 17th century.\nThe ships built here were noted for their maneuverability in restricted waters and superb sailing qualities.\nOne of the oldest designs in ship construction was the Baghalah which traversed along the Gujarat coast.\nThe main features of the Baghalah were that it had a length of 74 feet and a width of 25 feet. It weighed 150 tonnes and had a depth of about 11 feet.\nThe Baghalah was used for about 87 years from 1750-1837 CE. Thus, we see that India had a long shipbuilding heritage even before the British arrived.\n\nColonial Era\n\nWith the arrival of European colonial powers in the 15th century, Indian ship building changed due to the influence of foreign technologies and shipbuilding practices. The British East India Company established shipyards in India for its trade and naval needs.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution in Europe brought in its wake, several changes in shipbuilding.\nPaddle steamers began to be used instead of sail propulsion. In 1836, screw propellers were invented.\nBetween 1840 and 1880, shipbuilders began to use iron to build ships instead of wood, and by 1880, ships began to have steel hulls.\nThe first ships with electric motors were constructed in 1903, after the introduction of the turbine or rotary engine in 1900 and the diesel engine in 1895, respectively. Wood, coal, oil, and then gas were the fuels utilized in that sequence.\nEvery improvement necessitated modifications to the machinery and equipment used in its construction, use, and maintenance.\nThrough World War I, the cyclic depression of the 1920s and 1930s, and World War II, technical advancements were made, including the introduction of turbine, diesel, and supercharging engines, turbo-electric propulsion, and much higher engine speeds, as well as the replacement of transverse frames with longitudinal ones and the development of turbine and diesel propulsion. Electric arc welding first appeared at the start of World War II.\n\nThe Wadia\n\nDuring the 18th century, and the first half of the 19th century, the shipbuilding activity in India was dominated by one community \u2013 the Parsis.\n\nShipbuilding activity at Surat thrived and the Parsis showed absorbing interest. They built ships on order and built boats for sale. After Surat, the shipbuilding moved to Daman, Dhabul, Bassein, and Bombay.\n\nAt Bombay, one or two ships were built yearly on average from 1736 until 1743.\n\nThere were built Twelve distinct types of ships. The Admiralty placed a request for the construction of the Wadia Frigate known as \u201cSalsette\u201d in 1807.\nAfter a British naval squadron was trapped in ice for nine weeks in the North Baltic Sea, this ship emerged unharmed.\nUnlike English boats, which had an average longevity of 12 years, the Wadia\u2019s\u2019 ships lasted 30 years.\nFor the Royal Navy, several 74-gun ships were constructed between 1810 and 1813.\nThe 46-gun ship \u2018Trincomalee\u2019 was also constructed by the Wadia in 1817. The ship was given the new name \u2018Foudroyant\u2019 and had the title of being the oldest ship currently at sea.\n\nFor India, the switch from sail to steam and from steam to electricity occurred at the wrong moment.\n\nIn addition to the British shipbuilders\u2019 refusal to export this technology to India, the latter\u2019s industrialization lagged much behind that of the European countries. As a result, India\u2019s shipbuilding sector was all but destined for extinction.\n\nModern Shipbuilding\n\nAfter India gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947, efforts were made to revive and modernize the shipbuilding industry.\n\nThe government initiated several shipyards across the country, such as Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL), Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL), and Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn recent decades, India\u2019s shipbuilding industry has seen significant growth and modernization.\n\nIndian shipyards have been involved in constructing a wide range of vessels, including merchant ships, naval ships, offshore vessels, and even research vessels.\n\nThe shipbuilding industry has also been actively involved in exports, contributing to India\u2019s economy and strengthening its position in the global shipbuilding market.\n\nToday, India\u2019s shipbuilding industry continues to evolve and remains an essential part of the country\u2019s maritime sector.\n\nWith advancements in technology, infrastructure, and skilled workforce, Indian shipbuilders are competing internationally and contributing to the nation\u2019s maritime capabilities and trade ambitions.\n\nRelated Posts\nGreen Ship Building in India\nPorts and Shipping Industry in India\n\n-Article by Swathi Satish"

He also developed a spiritual conscience quite early having studied the Bhagavad Gita under the tutelage of his grandfather.\n\nHe abandoned his high school studies in 1916 to join Gandhi\u2019s ashram at Sabarmati, near Ahmadabad. Gandhi\u2019s teachings led Bhave to a life of austerity dedicated to improving Indian village life.\n\nThe name Vinoba (a traditional Marathi epithet signifying great respect) was conferred upon him by Mama Phadke, another member of the Ashram.\n\nAcharya Vinoba Bhave and Gandhi ji\n\nVinoba was attracted to the principles and ideologies of Mahatma Gandhi and he considered Gandhi his guru, from both political and spiritual points of view.\n\nHe followed Gandhi\u2019s leadership without question. Over the years, the bond between Vinoba and Gandhi grew stronger and his involvement in constructive programs for the society kept increasing.\n\nVinoba worked on the many Gandhian programs in the ashrams the leader established throughout the majority of his life.\n\nBy Gandhi\u2019s instructions, Vinoba traveled to Wardha on April 8, 1921, to take leadership of a Gandhi ashram there.\nBhave also published a magazine in Marathi called \u201cMaharashtra Dharma\u201d while he was staying in Wardha. His essays on the Upanishads were included in the monthly.\nHis political beliefs were based on the idea that freedom could only be attained via principles of nonviolent peace.\nHe participated in every one of Gandhi\u2019s political initiatives, even going so far as to attend them.\nHe shared Gandhi\u2019s social ideals, such as the equality of Indians and respect for all religions.\nAcharya Vinoba Bhave\u2019s Role in the Freedom Struggle\n\nVinoba joined the Indian freedom struggle as a result of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s influence.\n\nHe participated in non-cooperation campaigns, especially the one that encouraged using Swadeshi products rather than imports from abroad.\nHe started using the spinning wheel to produce Khadi and encouraged others to do the same, which led to the large-scale manufacture of the fabric.\n\nAcharya Vinoba Bhave was imprisoned in Dhulia for six months in 1932 after the authorities accused him of plotting to overthrow the British.\n\nHe spoke Marathi with the other convicts there while he discussed the many topics of the \u201cBhagwad Gita.\u201d A book containing all of his Gita lectures delivered in the Dhulia jail was eventually published.\n\nVinoba Bhave was only known to those close to him until 1940.

He took up the cause of those who were affectionately referred to as Harijans after being inspired by Gandhi\u2019s example.\n\nHis goal was to create the kind of society Gandhi had envisioned for a free India.\n\nGandhi coined the phrase \u201cProgress for All\u201d (Sarvodaya), which he adopted.\n\nThe Bhoodan Movement was the main initiative of the Sarvodaya movement, which he led, throughout the 1950s.\n\nBhoodan movement\nVinoba Bhave began his peace trek through the violence-hit area of Telangana on foot in 1951. The Pochampalli village\u2019s Harijans asked him to give them about 80 acres of land so they could support themselves.\nVinoba pleaded with the village\u2019s landowners to step up and help the Harijans. Unexpectedly, a landlord stood up and gave the needed land. A fresh chapter in the story of sacrifice and non-violence was added by this incident.\nThe Bhoodan (Gift of the Land) movement was just getting started at the time. Vinoba traveled the entire country, covering a distance of 58741 km, during the thirteen-year movement.\nThe Gramdan Movement, also known as the village gift movement, was the next stage of the Bhoodan movement. It attempted to establish community land ownership, resulting in self-sufficient settlements.\nFor the village council to manage and distribute the donated land to the inhabitants, the Gramdan movement persuaded the villagers to surrender their land to the council.\nMany political figures supported this campaign, which they saw as a solution to the issue of unequal land distribution in rural India.\n\nVinoba Bhave set up several Ashrams to promote a simple way of life, devoid of luxuries that took away one\u2019s focus from the Divine.\n\nHe established the Brahma Vidya Mandir in 1959, a small community for women, aiming at self-sufficiency on the lines of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s teachings.\n\nAs a result of a fast in 1979, he secured the government\u2019s promise to enforce the law prohibiting the killing of cows throughout India.\n\nDeath\n\nBhave lived out the last years of his life at his ashram, the Brahma Vidya Mandir, near Paunar, Wardha, Maharashtra.

        "[TITLE]": "Purana Qila Complex: The Grand Old Fort of Delhi",
        "[META]": "Last updated on August 15, 2023 by ClearIAS Team",
        "[CONTENT]": "In Delhi\u2019s Purana Qila (Old Fort), new excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have uncovered a continuous history spanning more than 2,500 years. The goal of these excavations is to determine the site\u2019s whole chronology. Read here to learn more.\n\nThe greatest mysteries are hidden beneath the Purana Qila complex, and Delhi\u2019s past is older than what the layers of dirt have so far disclosed.\n\nThe purpose of this cycle of archaeological excavation at the location is to descend to the historical period known as the \u201cMahabharat period,\u201d which is thought to have begun around 900 BCE.\n\nIt was the late Padma Vibhushan-winning archaeologist B.B. Lal who first linked the site to the Mahabharat period, during the pioneering and elaborate excavation work he conducted inside Purana Qila grounds in 1954 and then from 1969-73.\n\nThe last two archaeological excavations, in 2013-14 and 2017-18, found cultural deposits from Maurya to Shunga, Kushana, Gupta, Rajput, Sultanate, and Mughal periods.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Cities of Delhi\nPurana Qila Complex\nThe architecture of Purana Qila Complex\nFindings of recent excavations\nThe Cities of Delhi\nThe Lal Kot, a fortification wall built by Tomar Rajputs and renamed Qila Rai Pithora by Prithviraj Chauhan in the 12th century, is believed to be one of the oldest standing structures in Delhi.\nPrithviraj is said to have lost it, soon after, to the invading forces of Muhammad of Ghor in 1192 CE.\nThe Ghurid commander Aibek, who was left in charge of the dominions in Hindustan, developed the existing fort and built the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque and the Qutb Minar within its premises.\nThis site is traditionally known as the first city of Delhi.\nSubsequently, along with the coming of other dynasties to power, more cities came up- Siri, Tughlaqabad, Jahanpanah, Firozabad, Dinpanah, and Shahjahanabad.\n\nAlso Read: Cities of Delhi\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPurana Qila Complex\n\nThe Purana Qila is a timeless monument that stands on the South Eastern part of the present city of New Delhi.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor Humayun built the Purana Qila as a part of his new city of Dinpanah in the 16th century.\n\nHumayun started building the Purana Qila in 1533 CE as a part of his new fortified city named Din Panah or the \u201cSanctuary of Faith\u201d.\nA local tradition believes that the area in which the Purana Qila stands today is the site of Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas of the great epic Mahabharata.\nIt is for the same reason that the Purana Qila is often called the \u201cPandavon ka Qila\u201d.\n\nExcavations at this site in 1954\u201355 and 1969 -1973, conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India and headed by BB Lal, revealed a few shards of pottery belonging to the Painted Grey Ware (PGW) variety, that historians trace to the Mahabharata period (1500-1000 BCE).\n\nThey also revealed the existence of stratified layers belonging to 8 periods starting from the 4th century CE and continuing right up to the 19th century, confirming that the site had a long and unbroken chain of habitation for centuries.\nApart from archaeology, textual sources such as the Ain-i-Akbari of Abul Fazal (16th century), mention that Humayun had built the fort at the site of Indraprastha-the ancient capital of the Pandavas.\nIn fact, till 1913, there was in existence a village named Inderpat within the fort walls.\nThe village was relocated after the British started building the modern capital of Delhi.\n\nSher Shah Suri took over the Qila in 1540 CE. The Suri reign of 15 years was significant in terms of the architectural development of the fort. Sher Shah renamed Din Panah Sher Garh and built various important structures within it.\n\nAfter Humayun\u2019s death, Akbar continued to rule from Din Panah until 1571 CE when he founded the new Mughal capital of Fatehpur Sikri in Agra.\n\nDelhi\u2019s imperial significance then declined for some time until the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan.\n\nShah Jahan, however, opted to build his new capital city of Shahjahanabad (1639 CE) instead of reviving Din Panah.\n\nThe architecture of Purana Qila Complex\n\nThe Purana Qila fort complex is a conglomerate of various structures that lie scattered over an area of more than 300 acres.\n\nIt was surrounded by a wide moat that was linked to the river Yamuna- the waters of which once lapped against the eastern walls of the fort.\nIt is believed that only a few monuments have survived out of the original structure.\nSome of these standing structures are believed to be Humayun\u2019s work while others are attributed to Sher Shah.\n\nThe grandeur of the Purana Qila can be surmised from the three majestic gateways that stand today.\n\nThe Bada Darwaza\u00a0acts as the main and only point of entry to the fort today. It is a robust structure flanked by two massive bastions. While the gate is made of red sandstone with inlays of white and greyish-black marble, the bastions are constructed of stone and rubble. Multiple slits for arrows are visible both in the upper part of the gate and the bastions. The\nHumayun Darwaza is the southern entry to the fort complex. This gateway is divided into two stories with a high arch in the middle.\nThe third gateway, the Talaqi Darwaza, or the Forbidden Gate, is located on the northern side of the complex. The name Talaqi is an intriguing one and has several interesting stories attached to it. The gateway has two entrances- upper and lower. While the upper and more ornamental one served as the main entrance, the lower one once opened at the level of the moat.\n\nA prominent structure of the Purana Qila is the Qila-e-Kuhna mosque built by Sher Shah in 1542 CE. This mosque is an aesthetic structure that reflects a transitional stage between the architecture of the Lodhis and the Mughals.\n\nThe architectural features encountered here appear in more pronounced forms in the monuments built by Emperor Akbar later on.\nThe Qila-e-Kuhna is a rectangular domed structure built in grey quartzite with profuse use of red and yellow sandstone. The fa\u00e7ade of the structure contains five arches.\nThe central one or the Iwan is beautifully embellished with bands of calligraphy of verses from the Quran inscribed on it.\nThe architectural and symbolic focal point of the mosque is the Mihrabs that face west and indicate the direction of prayer.\nThe ceiling of the central dome represents a fine example of the brilliant craftsmanship involved in covering a rectangular space with a circular dome.\nThe four corners are filled by what is known as squinches that are exquisitely carved.\nThroughout the mosque, one can witness a harmonious blend- of Islamic architecture, that originated in West and Central Asia, and indigenous Hindu stylistic motifs such as the Kalash and the lotus.\n\nAnother prominent structure inside the Purana Qila is the Sher Mandal. This structure is believed to have been built by Sher Shah in around 1541 CE.\n\nAfter Humayun recaptured the throne, he is said to have converted this building into a library.\nThe Sher Mandal is a compact octagonal structure built in red sandstone and sparingly decorated with white and black marble inlay.\nEmperor Humayun had a fatal fall on the steps of this very structure.\n\nClose to the Sher Mandal lies a baoli or a stepwell. The baoli consists of a long flight of stairs, interrupted by landings, that lead to the water level. This structure is an interesting example of how water supply was managed during medieval times.\n\nAnother structure is the hammam or the bathhouse. Flights of narrow and steep steps lead to this closed underground chamber wherein one can still see the terracotta pipes and chutes that enabled the water supply.\n\nTwo other outlying structures that are often perceived as part of the Purana Qila are the Lal Darwaza and the Khairul Manazil.\n\nThe Lal Darwaza or the Red Gate is an imposing gateway built of red sandstone and grey quartzite believed to be the southern entrance to the city of Sher Garh.\nThe Khairul Manazil was commissioned by Maham Anga, Akbar\u2019s wet nurse, around 1561-62 CE to house a mosque and a madrassa.\nThe structure though fairly simple still speaks of the power and influence that Maham Anga held in Akbar\u2019s life.\n\nSir Edwin Lutyens, who built the modern imperial capital of Delhi (1912-1930) for the British, is said to have aligned the central vista, now called the Rajpath, with the Humayun Darwaza of the Purana Qila.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the premises of the fort also served as an internment camp for Japanese civilians in British India.\n\nDuring the Partition of India in 1947, hundreds of refugees are said to have camped at the Purana Qila for several months.\n\nFindings of recent excavations\n\nNine cultural stages, including Pre-Mauryan, Mauryan, Sunga, Kushana, Gupta, Post-Gupta, Rajput, Sultanate, and Mughal, have been revealed through artifacts from various historical eras.\n\nShards of Painted Gray Ware Pottery: These pottery pieces are typically dated to the period of 1200 BC to 600 BC, indicating the existence of human settlements in the pre-Mauryan era.\nVaikuntha Vishnu Sculpture: A 900-year-old sculpture of Vaikuntha Vishnu, belonging to the Rajput period, was discovered during the excavation.\nTerracotta Plaque: A terracotta plaque depicting the goddess Gaja Lakshmi, dating back to the Gupta period, was found at the site.\nTerracotta Ring Well: The remains of a well dating back 2,500 years from the Mauryan period were unearthed.\nSunga-Kushan Period Complex: The excavation revealed a well-defined four-room complex from the Sunga-Kushan period, which dates back approximately 2,300 years.\nCoins, Seals, and Copper Artifacts: More than 136 coins, 35 seals and sealings, and other copper artifacts were discovered at the site. These findings indicate the site\u2019s significance as a center for trade activities.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

He was thereafter detained from 1921 and 1923.\n\nIn 1921, he founded Servants of the People Society, a non-profit welfare organization, in Lahore, which shifted its base to Delhi after the partition.\n\nIn Punjab, he organized fierce protests against the British in response to their terrible conduct in Jallianwallah Bagh and Rowlatt Act before.\n\nLajpat Rai disagreed with Gandhi\u2019s decision to put the movement on hold following the Chauri Chaura tragedy and went on to form the Congress Independence Party.\n\nTo examine constitutional improvements, the Simon Commission went to India in 1929.\n\nThe fact that there were only British representatives on the Commission severely incensed the leaders of India.\nLala Lajpat Rai was on the frontline of the protests that erupted across the nation.\nDeath\n\nWhen the Simon Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lajpat Rai led a non-violent march in protest against it.

The origin of Aryans is widely disputed- Some claim that they originated in the Central Asian region near the Caspian Sea (Max Muller), while others believe that they came from the Russian Steppes. According to Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the Aryans originated in the Arctic.\n\nThe agreed upon facts about Aryans is that they were semi-nomadic, pastoral people who lived rural life compared to the previous urban Harappans.\n\nThey spoke the Indo-Aryan language- Sanskrit.\nThe knowledge about the Aryans comes mostly from the Rigveda Samhita.\n\nThe period of Vedic Civilization (1500-500 BCE) is divided into two broad parts-\n\nEarly Vedic Period (1500-1000 BC), also known as Rig Vedic Period\nLater Vedic Period (1000- 600 BC)\nEarly Vedic civilization\n\nThe Rig Vedic period is the oldest documented age around 1400-1000 BCE.\n\nAccounts of military conflicts between the various tribes of Vedic Aryans are described in the Rigveda.\n\nMost notable of such conflicts was the Battle of the Ten Kings, which took place on the banks of the river Parushni (modern-day Ravi).\nThe Bharata tribe, headed by their chief Sudas, engaged in combat with a coalition of ten other tribes.\nThe Purus, their western neighbors, dwelt near the lower reaches of the Saraswati River, while the Bharatas lived around its upper reaches.\nThe other tribes lived in Punjab to the northwest of the Bharatas. The conflict could have been sparked by the division of the waters of Ravi.\nBy widening the embankments of Ravi, the confederation of tribes attempted to engulf the Bharatas, but Sudas won the Battle of Ten Kings. After the conflict, the Bharatas and Purus joined to form the Kuru tribe.\n\nIt also contains accounts of conflicts between the Aryas and the Dasas and Dasyus. Dasas and Dasyus were the people who do not perform sacrifices (akratu) or obey the commandments of gods (avrata).\n\nPolitical organization\nThese tribal kingdoms included the Bharatas, Matsyas, Yadus, and Purus.\nThe \u2018Rajan\u2019 or king served as the head of the realm.\nTypically, the Rig Vedic state was a hereditary monarchy.\nThere were two organizations: the Samiti (general assembly of people) and the Sabha (council of elders).\nThe fundamental unit of political organization was the \u201ckula.\u201d\nA \u201cgrama\u201d was made up of many related families.\n\u2018Gramani\u2018 was the \u2018grama\u2019s\u2019 leader.\n\u2018Visu\u2019 was the name of the group of villages commanded by \u2018Vishayapati\u2019.\nThe \u2018Jana\u2019 or tribe served as the highest level of government and administration.\nSocietal organization\nIn essence, the Rig Vedic civilization was patriarchal.\nThe family, or \u201cgraham,\u201d was the fundamental unit of society, and its leader was known as the \u201cgrahapathi.\u201d\nWhile polygamy was observed in royal and noble households, monogamy was the norm.\nWomen enjoyed the same possibilities for intellectual and spiritual growth that males had. Women poets included Apala, Viswavara, Ghosa, and Lopamudra.\nThe widely attended gatherings were open to women.\nNo sati, no child marriage has been mentioned in the literature.\nSocial stratification was flexible.\nEconomy\nThe Aryans of the Rig Vedic civilization were pastoral herders.\nThey started farming once they had made their permanent home in North India.\nChariots and ploughs were built by carpenters.\nWorkers used iron, bronze, and copper to create a range of items.\nA significant occupation was spinning, which produced cotton and woolen cloths.\nJewelers crafted ornaments.\nThe potters produced a variety of utensils for residential usage.\nBarter was used to conduct trade initially, but eventually, significant transactions switched to using gold coins called \u201cnishka.\u201d\nRivers were used as a mode of transportation.\nReligion\nThe Rig Vedic Aryans humanized many natural forces such as earth, fire, wind, rain, and thunder into gods to worship them.\nPrithvi (Earth), Agni (Fire), Vayu (Wind), Varuna (Rain), and Indra (Thunder) are a few significant Rig Vedic deities.\n\u201cVaruna\u201d is the defender of the laws of nature.\n\u2018Aditi\u2019 and \u2018Ushas\u2019 are female deities.\nNo idol worship or temples was observed.\nLater Vedic Civilization\n\nAround 1000 BCE, the Vedic society fully transformed into settled agriculture practitioners.\n\nThe demand for horses, which were required for cavalry and sacrifice but could not be bred in India, remained a top concern for Vedic leaders and a relic of the nomadic lifestyle.\n\nThis led to trade routes beyond the Hindu Kush to sustain this supply.\n\nBecause of the dense forest cover, the Vedic tribes had been unable to access the Gangetic plains.\n\nAfter 1000 BCE, iron axes and ploughs were widely used, making it simple to clear the rainforests.\nDue to this, the Vedic Aryans were able to expand their settlements into the Ganga-Yamuna Doab\u2019s western region.\nMany of the previous tribes merged to become more powerful political entities.\nPolitical organization\n\u2018Mahajanapadas or rashtras\u2019 were created by the union of larger kingdoms.\nAs a result, the king\u2019s authority grew. To solidify his position, he carried out several ceremonies and sacrifices, including the Vajapeya (chariot race), Asvamedha (horse sacrifice), and Rajasuya (a consecration ceremony).\nRajavisvajanan, Ahilabhuvanapathi (lord of the entire earth), Ekrat, and Samrat (only ruler) were the names that the monarchs adopted.\nHowever, the Samiti and the Sabha lost some of their significance.\nSociety\nFour societal divisions\u2014Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras\u2014became the Varna system.\nBrahmins and Kshatriyas held positions of authority over others.\nBased on employment, several subcastes developed.\nWomen had lost their political rights to attend assemblies and were now seen as inferior to and submissive to males.\nChild marriages increased in frequency.\nEconomy\nThe removal of forests allowed for the cultivation of more land. The understanding of manure advanced.\nAs a result, farming became the primary employment of those who grew wheat, rice, and barley.\nWith the expansion of metalwork, leatherwork, woodwork, and ceramics, industrial activity became specialized.\nBoth domestic and international trade increased significantly (they engaged in maritime trade with Babylon).\nA new class called vaniya, or hereditary merchants, emerged.\nVaisyas who engaged in trade and business grouped to form \u201cganas,\u201d or guilds.\nCoins: In addition to the \u201cnishka,\u201d gold coins called \u201csatamana\u201d and silver coins called \u201ckrishnala\u201d were also employed as means of transaction.\nReligion\nAgni and Indra became less significant.\nRudra, the destroyer, Vishnu, the protector, and Prajapathi, the creator became significant deities.\nThe rites and sacrifices grew increasingly complex.\nBut prayers lost some of their significance.\nThe priesthood evolved into an inherited profession. They established the guidelines for these sacrifices and rites.\nAs a result, at the end of this time, there was a tremendous backlash against this priestly dominance as well as against complex sacrifices and rites. As a result, Buddhism and Jainism flourished.\nArchaeology of Vedic Civilization\n\nArchaeological evidence has been found from the phases of Vedic culture like the Ochre Coloured Pottery, the Gandhara grave, the Black and red ware, and the Painted Grey Ware.\n\nOchre-colored pottery was discovered in the Badaun and Bisjuar area of western Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThis culture is considered to have been prevalent around the second half of the year 2000 BCE, during a time when the Harrapan culture was coming to an end and the Indus Valley civilization was in transition.\n\nThe term \u201cGandhara graves\u201d describes the early cemetery that can be discovered in the Gandhara area, which stretches from Bajuar to the Indus.\n\nThe burial layout and \u201cmortuary practice\u201d in these cemeteries appear predetermined, including rigid inhumation and cremation.\nThis civilization developed in three stages: the bottom stage, during which graves are covered with enormous stone slabs, the upper stage, during which urn burials and cremations are added, and the third stage, known as the \u201csurface\u201d stage.\n\nThe phrase \u201cblack and red ware culture\u201d was first used by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in 1946.\n\nIn addition to portions of West Asia and Egypt, black-and-red pottery expanded throughout India during the Neolithic era and persisted until the early Middle Ages.\nAs the name implies, the pottery often has a red bottom half on the outside and a black rim/inside surface.\nRed-ware pottery often falls into one of two subcategories: cooking pots or offering stands.\nThe majority of these clay items were open-mouthed bowls with one side polished, painted, or slip-painted; however, a few jars, pots, and dishes-on-stands have also been discovered.\n\nAn important ceramic type known as painted grey ware has been associated with a group of people who lived in the Sutlej, Ghagger, and Upper Ganga/Yamuna Valleys.\n\nThese people are thought to have been early Aryans who came to India at the beginning of the Vedic period.\nThe painted grey ware culture is believed to have been spread by tribes that also brought iron technology to the Indo-Gangetic plains, making this pottery a significant indicator of the Northern Indian Iron Age.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

There was a lot of planning involved in constructing such massive walls.\nThis kind of massive construction needs a significant amount of labor, perhaps from thousands of men, women, and kids.\nThe ruler could more readily maintain authority over the territory and inhabitants inside the walled city.\nThe rajas started keeping armies. The king maintained and gave regular salaries to the soldiers throughout the year.\nThey began collecting regular taxes under the rule of the Janapadas raja.\nThe most significant taxes were those on agriculture. This was referred to as bhaga or share.\nCraftspeople were subject to taxes as well.\nHerders were also obliged to pay taxes in the form of\u00a0animals and animal goods.\n\u00a0The raja needs forest produce from hunters and gatherers.\nMost Prominent Mahajanapadas\n\nAccording to the Buddhist canonical literature Ahguttara Nikaya, there were sixteen significant states known as \u201cSolasa Mahajanapada\u201d. There were sixteen Mahajanapadas, and they either followed a monarchical or republican\n\npolitical structure. The republics were located in north-western India, in what is now Punjab, and along the foothills of the Himalayas, whereas the monarchies were mostly found in the Gangetic Plains.\nThe Anguttara Nikaya lists the following sixteen Mahajanapadas:\n\nAnga\nMagadha\nKasi\nKosala\nYajji\nMalla\nChhedi\nYamsa\nKuru\nPanchala\nMaccha\nSurasena\nAssaka\nAvanti\nGandhara\nKamboja.\n\nGandhara, Kamboja, Kashi, Vatsa, Avanti, Chedi, Kuru, Panchala, Matsya, Anga, Kosala, Magadha, and Surasena are some of the monarchies. Republics include Vajji, Malla, and Assaka.\n\nAnga\n\nThe ancient texts Aitareya Brahmana, the Mahabharata, the Puranas, and the Ramayana all mention the Anga nation, which attests to its antiquity.\n\nIt corresponds to the modern states of Bihar and West Bengal.\n\nIts capital, Champa, was located where the Ganga and Champa rivers converged.\n\nAccording to the \u201cJain Prajnapana,\u201d the Angas were one of the first Aryan ethnic groups.\n\nOver time, the kingdom of Anga developed into a significant trading hub, drawing traders from nearby kingdoms. Suvarnabhumi was a major trading hub on the commerce routes in South East Asia, therefore merchants traveled there.\n\nIt was captured by Magadha under the reign of Bimbisara, and it was his sole successful conquest.\n\nMagadha\n\nMagadha is mentioned in the Atharva Veda.\n\nAmong the most well-known Mahajanapadas, It was situated halfway between Vatsa and Anga.\n\nIt was bordered on the north and west by the rivers Ganga and Son, on the south by the Vindhyas outcrop, and on the east by the river Champa.\n\nRajagriha was the initial Magadhan capital.

        "[CONTENT]": "Schools of Buddhism developed after the death of Buddha to propagate his teachings. The schools over the years have been interpreted in different ways giving rise to numerous subsects and movements. Read here to learn about the major schools of Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is a way of life that is founded on the teachings of the Buddha, who lived in India during the sixth and fourth centuries BCE. Buddhism is the fourth most practiced religion in the world, with little over 7% of the world\u2019s population identifying as Buddhists.\n\nBuddhism has been widely popular since the Buddha\u2019s passing in the fifth-century BCE in India. His teachings have been altered over time as a result of encounters with various groups of people and civilizations.\n\nThe main tenets of Buddhism include a renunciation of desire, studying sacred texts, engaging in meditation, and cultivating compassion. Based on these tenets various schools developed within the Buddhist faith.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSchools of Buddhism\nTheravada Buddhism\nMahayana Buddhism\nVajrayana Buddhism\nOther Schools of Buddhism\nSchools of Buddhism\n\nInitially, there may have been a unified vision of what Buddha had taught but, in time, disagreements over what constituted the \u201ctrue teaching\u201d resulted in fragmentation and the establishment of three main schools:\n\nTheravada Buddhism (The School of the Elders)\nMahayana Buddhism (The Great Vehicle)\nVajrayana Buddhism (The Way of the Diamond)\n\nThe Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Way as taught by the Buddha are shared by all three schools, although they each follow the road differently.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlthough followers of each believe otherwise, they all recognize they are a part of Ekayana (\u201cOne Vehicle\u201d or \u201cOne Path\u201d) in that they all support Buddha\u2019s overarching goal and work to spread peace and compassion in the world.\n\nAccording to objective standards, none are seen as more legitimate than the others, nor are the numerous minor schools that have emerged.\n\nAn Arahant is an awakened being, one who has destroyed desire, anger, and ignorance and has acquired Nibbana (Nirvana) in this life from personal experience.\n\nThe Buddha was also an Arahant. However, unlike the other Arahants, the Buddha discovered the path himself, without instructions. In other words, the Buddha was the first Arahant.\n\nShortly after the death of the Buddha, 500 Arahants gathered and formed the 1st council meeting led by the Venerable Maha Kassapa, the oldest among them, to repeat the teachings of the Buddha and record them in memory.\n\nIn the first years after the Buddha\u2019s death there were still disciples who had awakened directly under his guidance.\n\nHalfway through the 4th century BC, less than 100 years after the death of the Buddha, discord arose within the Sangha (the order of monks).\nThe primary cause is not clear. Probably there was a difference of opinion about the Vinaya, the moral rules of conduct for monks, but even that is not certain.\n\nThe Mahasanghikas, seem to have been in favor of less moral rules and held the opinion that an Arahant still had mental limitations, because this is what could be seen in many so-called Arahants, and the ultimate goal for a monk should therefore be to become a Buddha.\n\nThe Sthaviravadins, seem to have wanted more or stricter moral rules and stuck to arahantship as the ultimate goal of the Buddha\u2019s path, declaring that those who claimed to be Arahants but still had mental (or mainly moral) limitations were not Arahant at all.\n\nTheravada Buddhism\n\nTheravada school of Buddhism claims to be the oldest school and to maintain Buddha\u2019s original vision and teachings. It is also known as Hinayana (lesser vehicle) sometimes.\n\nTheravada, the school of the Elders, began to take shape around 250 BC through the original disciples of Buddha.\nIt is considered the most orthodox form of Buddhism and has followers mainly in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka.\nThe vipassana movement (mindfulness) is a modern-day school within Theravada Buddhism.\nTheravada concentrates on the original teachings of Buddha- the four noble truths and the eight-fold path.\nThey follow strict monastic life of meditation to attain nirvana.\nThey do not worship buddha as a deity but rather believe in his teachings of karma and meditation.\n\nFrom 268 to 232 BCE Asoka the Great of the Maurya Dynasty ruled over almost the entire Indian subcontinent.\n\nHe converted to Buddhism and focused on ahimsa, non-violence. Asoka is seen as a great, tolerant, and respectful leader, an example for kings that came after him.\n\nHe spent his wealth on his people and the Sangha. With this, however, he also created a problem.\n\nGreedy and immoral people infiltrated the Sangha to take advantage of his charity.\nThey were not interested in liberation, only in the offerings provided and the associated status, and therefore held wrong views, which resulted in a decrease in the respect for the Sangha.\n\nWhen Asoka heard of this corruption, he organized a 3rd council meeting in 250 BCE to purify Buddhism and record the true Dhamma.\n\nThe Venerable Moggaliputtatissa chaired the 9-month-long 3rd council meeting.\n\nThe Venerable Moggaliputtatissa belonged to the Vibhajjavada school, the doctrine of analysis descended from the Sthaviravadins.\n\nThe Dhamma that was recorded during the 3rd council meeting and supported by Asoka was the Tipitaka (the three baskets).\n\nThe followers of this movement called themselves Theriya\u2019s \u2018elders\u2019 and in this way, Theravada was born.\nSince then, the Pali Canon, the Pali version of the Tipitaka, has existed. Since the 3rd Council meeting of 250 BCE, no more teachings have been added or removed from the main texts.\nBuddhagosa wrote the Visuddhimagga, a monumental summary of the Tipitaka.\n\nAsoka\u2019s son, Mahinda traveled to Sri Lanka to preach Buddhist teachings, and Theravada Buddhism, flourished in Sri Lanka.\n\nMahayana Buddhism\n\nMahayana (Great Vehicle) school of Buddhism is a group of religious practices that emphasizes the bodhisattva path and upholds the Mahayana sutras.\n\nAccording to contemporary researchers, these writings originate from the first century BCE.\n\nIt was founded 400 years after Buddha\u2019s death, probably inspired by the early Mahasanghika ideology, and was streamlined and codified by the sage Nagarjuna (c. 2nd century CE), the central figure of the school.\n\nMahayana schools often maintain that there are now numerous Buddhas who are accessible and that they are transcendental or supramundane creatures, in contrast to Theravada and other early schools.\n\nMahayana Buddhism is said to have split off from Theravada in the belief that it was too self-centered and had lost its true vision; this school also claims it holds to the Buddha\u2019s original teaching.\n\nThe Mahasangikas around the 2nd council meeting (4th century BCE) began to find the goal of becoming an Arahant inadequate.\nThis opened the way to Buddhahood as an alternative, which seems to have been the first point of departure.\nAround the 3rd council meeting in 250 BCE. there were 18 different Buddhist schools.\n\nThey believed that Buddha had infinite compassion and hence would not enter nirvana where no good for others can be done. Therefore, there must be some aspect of the Buddha that is still present in the here and now as an expression of his infinite compassion.\n\nThey revered and worshipped Buddha as a god, hence deification is observed in this sect.\nThey believed Buddhahood is for everyone, hence they were more liberal and inclusive than the earlier schools.\nEven though they considered Buddha a divine being, they also believed that every person is a potential Buddha. The emphasis is on striving for the enlightenment of all beings and not only yourself.\nThey attained salvation through worshipping Buddha and following his core teachings.\n\nThe Mahayana school spread around Central Asia via the silk route around the 1st century CE. It is followed largely in China, Korea, and Japan.\n\nVajrayana Buddhism\n\nVajrayana school of Buddhism developed, largely in Tibet, in response to what was perceived as too many rules in Mahayana Buddhism.\n\nThe Vajrayana, as a relatively late branch from the Mahayana, seems to have started somewhere around the 5th century CE. It is also known as Tantrayana or Tantric Buddhism.\n\nTantra is a combination of mantras (protective verses), actions, and visualizations that accelerate the path to enlightenment.\nIts origins lay in the changing environment of mainland India where Jainism and Hinduism became more prevalent and the Huns regularly went on raids with devastating consequences for monastic communities.\nThe beginning of this movement is attributed to a group of mahasiddha (great masters), a kind of magician who lived in India and seem to have complemented the teachings of the Buddha with esoteric rituals.\n\nVajrayana Buddhism focuses on the efforts of becoming a buddha and creating a unique path to enlightenment through tantric rituals.\n\nIn Vajrayana Buddhism, it is understood that one already has a Buddha nature, and everyone does, just as Mahayana believes \u2013 but, in Vajrayana, one only has to realize this to fully awaken.\nAn adherent, therefore, does not have to give up bad habits such as drinking alcohol or smoking right away to begin one\u2019s work on the path; one only has to commit to following the path and the desire to engage in unhealthy and damaging behaviors will steadily lose their allure.\nInstead of distancing one\u2019s self from desire, one steps toward and through it, shedding one\u2019s attachment as one proceeds in the discipline\nTara is a meditation deity\u00a0revered by practitioners of the Tibetan branch of\u00a0Vajrayana Buddhism to develop certain inner qualities and to understand outer, inner, and secret teachings such as\u00a0karu\u1e47a (compassion),\u00a0metta\u00a0(loving-kindness), and\u00a0shunyata\u00a0(emptiness).\n\nIt was systematized by the sage Atisha (982-1054 CE) in Tibet and so is sometimes referred to as Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, often referenced as the spiritual leader of all Buddhists, is technically only the spiritual head of the Vajrayana School, and his views are most directly in line with this school of thought.\n\nThis sect can primarily be found in Bhutan, Mongolia, Tibet, and the Kalmykia region of Russia.\n\nOther Schools of Buddhism\n\nMany other Buddhist schools have developed from these three all around the world.\n\nIn the West, the most popular of these is Zen Buddhism which traveled from China to Japan and was most fully developed there before arriving in the West.\nPure Land Buddhism is another which developed from Mahayana Buddhism and its goal is rebirth in a \u201cpure land\u201d of a Buddha Realm which exists on a higher plane.\nAn increasingly popular school in the West is Secular Buddhism which rejects all metaphysical aspects of the belief system to focus on self-improvement for its own sake.\nIn addition, present-day Buddhism may also be found in two doctrinal schools, known as Prasangika and Svatantrika.\nAnother division of Buddhism is referred to as Newar Buddhism, which is a sect based on the caste system.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

A small EIC force sent to better garrison the area was wiped out in April.\n\nHastings sent four separate armies into Nepal, but three of these columns were repeatedly defeated in several hard-fought encounters.\n\nThe Gurkha army only numbered between five and eight thousand men during the war, but crucially, they were fighting on familiar home territory.\n\nOne notable EIC loss was at the Battle of Jitgurh (aka Jit Gadhi) of 1814.\n\nThe terrain made it difficult for EIC armies to transport their artillery and give the general logistical support armies in the field needed.\n\nThe Gurkhas were fierce fighters above everything else.\n\nThe kukri knife, which had a long, curved blade that resembled a machete and was used by the Gurkhas to infamously mutilate enemy bodies, was their most well-known weapon.\nIt was useful for slashing and cutting through dense vegetation.\nThe Nepalese had matchlock weapons as well.\nGuerrilla tactics were used by the Gurkhas to best take advantage of the challenging terrain of the mountains and forests.\n\n1815: \u00a0By this time, the British logistics were severely tested so far from their bases in Bengal. Hastings was obliged to send bigger and better-led armies to the frontier in a new round of fighting in 1815.\n\nOne notable British Commander, Sir Ochterlony began to reverse the trend of EIC losses. He besieged the major Gurkha fort of Malaon and captured Kumaun (Kumaon) in May 1815.\n\nThe EIC attempted to negotiate a peace settlement, but the Nepalese were not willing to give up territories or their independence and so decided to fight on.\n\nThe British through subterfuge used local smugglers as guides and bypassed the heavily fortified passes in the valley of Nepal to march the army.\n\n1816: At the Battle of Makwanpur, Ochterlony orchestrated the most decisive EIC victory in Nepal.\n\nMore battles and sieges followed with Ochterlony taking the time to build roads to get his heavy cannons into better positions to blast the Gurkha forts.\n\nThe Nepalese eventually decided to initiate peace when Kathmandu came under direct threat from Ochterlony and was subjected to the constant campaigning of the EIC with its much superior resources, which allowed it to regularly replenish losses in material and manpower.\n\nTreaty of Sugauli\n\nThe Kumaun and Garhwal kingdoms were among the territories that the Nepalese kings ceded to the EIC by the terms of the 1816 Treaty of Sugauli.\n\nIt also required them to have a permanent British resident at their court, withdraw from Sikkim, and cede a sizable portion of their territory.\n\nIn practice, Nepal became a protectorate of the British, but at least they were exempt from paying an annual subsidy to the EIC, unlike several princely states in India.\n\nThere were no further wars between Nepal and the EIC as a result of this treaty, in contrast to innumerable earlier agreements of this kind.\n\nThe aftermath of the Anglo-Nepalese war\n\nThe Gurkhas became valuable allies to the East India Company, for example, Gurkha battalions participated in the Sikh Wars and played an important part in the Company quashing the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857-8.\n\nGurkhas comprised about one-sixth of the British Indian Army by 1914.\n\nThe Gurkhas were the first non-British soldiers to have the honor of defending Buckingham Palace, the London residence of the British royal family, due to their renown and reputation for fidelity.\n\nThe Nepalese, British, Indian, and Malaysian militaries all still use Gurkhas.\n\nAfter the Nepalese war, the EIC next moved on to the northeast to fight the three Anglo-Burmese Wars (1824-85) and to the northwest and the two Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845-49).\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

They later founded the Pagan Kingdom (1044\u20131297) which united the Irrawaddy valley and its surroundings for the first time.\n\nAfter the First Mongol invasion of Burma in 1287, several small kingdoms, of which the Kingdom of Ava, the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, the Kingdom of Mrauk U, and the Shan States were principal powers, came to dominate the landscape.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn the late 16th century, the Toungoo dynasty (1510\u20131752) reunified the country and founded the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a brief period.\n\nLater in the late 18th century, the Konbaung dynasty (1752\u20131885) restored the kingdom and continued the Taungoo reforms that increased central rule in peripheral regions and produced one of the most literate states in Asia.\n\nThe dynasty also went to war with all its neighbors. The Anglo-Burmese wars (1824\u201385) eventually led to British colonial rule.\n\nBurma was unified between 1752-60 by King Alaungpaya of the Konbaung dynasty. His successor, Bodawpaya ruled from Ava on the Irrawaddy River invaded nearby territories of Siam and repelled Chinese invasions, and eventually reached British India\u2019s borders.\n\nFirst Anglo-Burmese War (1824-26)\n\n\u00a0\n\nCourtesy: Britannica\n\nThe Konbaung dynasty conquered the Arakan region in 1785, and the present-day Manipur region by 1813 brought the Burmese border into contact with British India.\n\n1822: Burma conquered Assam, which led to conflicts along the ill-defined borders of Bengal and Burma. The Arakanese rebels hiding in Chittagong constantly raided the Burmese Arakan regions.\n\n1823: The clashes reached the island of Shalpuri which was earlier occupied by Burma but was under British control later. The British rejected the Burmese proposal to neutralize the island.\n\n1824: The British declared war on Burma officially and sent naval forces into the Burmese mainland through Yangon (Rangoon) harbor (Battle of Yangon).\n\n1825: \u00a0The British entered the capital Ava where the famous Burmese general Maha Bandula was killed in action. But the Burmese resistance was tough, especially their guerrilla warfare in jungles.\n\nThe constant rains and virulent diseases of forests killed more soldiers than the actual war and a peace treaty was agreed upon.\n\n1826: Treaty of Yandabo was signed to bring the first Anglo-Burmese war to an end. Burma lost its occupied territories of Assam, Manipur, and Arakan. They also had to cede a lot of their coastline to the British.\n\nThey also had to accept a British resident at Ava but a Burmese envoy was posted at Calcutta too.\n\nSecond Anglo-Burmese War (1852-53)\n\nThe second war was caused by the British commercial greed as they began to exploit the vast forests of upper Burma for timber. They wanted to expand their market for the sale of cotton products as well.\n\nLord Dalhousie was the governor-general of India (1848-56) who provoked this war. He dispatched Commodore Lambert to Burma over several minor issues related to the previous treaty. The Burmese had started blocking commercial exploitation through the coasts.\n\n1852: The British launched an attack on Burma over a petty complaint by British merchants and Lambert provoked a naval confrontation over this. The British sea strength was superior and they captured Rangoon and eventually annexed the Pegu province which was renamed Lower Burma.\n\nThe war resulted in a palace revolution in Burma, with King Pagan Min (1846\u20131853) being replaced by his half-brother, Mindon Min (1853\u20131878).\n\nThird Anglo-Burmese War (1885-86)\n\nKing Mindon tried to modernize the Burmese state and economy to ensure its independence, and he established a new capital at Mandalay, which he proceeded to fortify.\n\nTo offset the British, he entertained envoys from France and sent his emissaries there. King Mindon died in 1878 and his son Thibaw took over the reign.\n\nDuring the reign of Thibaw (1878\u201385), the British were willing to ignore Upper Burma and concentrate on French moves in Laos, Vietnam, and Yunnan.\n\n1885: King Thibaw signed a commercial trade treaty with the French which alarmed the British.\n\nThis action provoked British forces to strike. The annexation of Upper Burma was announced in 1885, ending the Konbaung dynasty and Burmese independence.\n\nThe regions under King Thibaw were added to British Indian Empire after his surrender.\n\nEven though the Third Anglo-Burmese War formally ended before it had even developed, but resistance to British rule continued for another four years. The Burmese army officials carried out widespread guerrilla warfare from the jungles while the people of lower Burma also rose in rebellion.\n\nImpact of Anglo-Burmese wars\n\nThe Burmese resistance took the British almost five years to suppress, the expenses of which were taxed on the Indians.\n\nThe remnants of the Anglo-Burmese were carried in people\u2019s minds for years. after World War I (1914-18), a modern nationalist movement arose in Burma. There were campaigns boycotting British goods and administration with demand for home rule.\n\nBurmese nationalism caused the British to separate Burma from India in 1935 to weaken the struggle. In 1937, Burma became a separately administered colony of Great Britain.\n\nThe Burmese nationalist movement reached heights under the leadership of Aung San during World War II.

Kabul demanded the restoration of Peshawar captured by the Sikh kingdom. The British were unsure of their power to deal with the Sikhs and hence refused Kabul\u2019s demand.\n\n1838: Great Britain, concerned about growing Persian and Russian influences, invaded Afghanistan.

This helped Hyder Ali consolidate his power inside Mysore without the Marathas knocking on their borders.\n\nHyder Ali became king of Mysore in 1761 after overthrowing the prime minister and making the king, Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, a prisoner in his palace.\n\nHyder Ali formally titled himself Sultan Hyder Ali Khan in his correspondence with the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II.\n\nA series of income and tax changes that enabled Hyder Ali, an experienced general, to finance a sizable army, gave him the wherewithal to extend his empire, which included the southern part of India.\n\nWeapon advancements, notably the employment of portable rocket launchers, which were often launched by cavalry riders, were another benefit for Mysore.\nFirst Anglo-Mysore war (1767-99)\n\nFrom the middle of the 1750s, the British had won many significant battles that gave them control over commercial hubs like Pondicherry and Arcot.\n\nWhen the EIC appeared to be preoccupied with developing in Bengal, in northeast India, in the 1760s, Haidar Ali courted the French as friends and saw the chance to expand into the less powerful EIC presidency (administrative province) of Madras.\n\nThe war was instigated by the Nizam of Hyderabad who wanted to divert the British attention from the Northern Circars.\n\n1767: Hyder Ali declared war on the East India Company in August 1767. The East India Company joined forces with the Nizam of Hyderabad to attack Mysore.\n\nHyder Ali bought off the Marathas with a huge quantity of silver and they withdrew their support. The withdrawal of the Marathas resulted in the Nizam of Hyderabad switching sides.\n\nThe English forces pushed Mysore and Hyderabad back in the Battle of Trinamalai.\n\n1768: The Nizam of Hyderabad signed the treaty with the British and left Mysore to fight the battle alone. The Easy India Company had meanwhile mobilized more forces from Bombay by now.\n\nCaught between three armies, Haidar Ali decided to sue for peace, one which the British were glad to accept given the already high costs of the war.\n\n1769: The Treaty of Madras was signed between Mysore and the British wherein they promised help to each other in case the other was attacked.\n\nSecond-Anglo Mysore War (1780-84)\n\nHyder Ali, confident of the British support due to the Treaty of Madras, engaged in war with the Marathas in 1770. But the British refused to assist him.\n\nHyder Ali angered by the British breach of the treaty committed himself to an alliance with the French.\n\nThe Anglo-French war of 1778 ignited conflict in the Indian subcontinent yet again. The British resolved to drive out the French from India and began to attack French outposts.\n\n1779: They attacked Pondicherry and then the French-controlled port at Mah\u00e9 on the Malabar Coast.\n\nHyder placed significant strategic value on Mah\u00e9 because he used the port to acquire French-supplied weapons and ammunition. Hyder not only let the British know that Mah\u00e9 was under his protection, but he also sent them troops to defend it. In addition to the French, Hyder also organized a confederacy against the British with the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas.\n\n1780: Haidar Ali invaded the Carnatic coast to the east with a massive army of 70,000-100,000 men. Through 1780, many isolated British forts were captured and Madras came under serious threat again.\n\nThe British, largely due to poor planning and even poorer logistics, suffered a resounding defeat at the Battle of Pollilur in 1780.\n\n1781: Sir Eyre Coot returned to command the English army and defeated Hyder Ali in the Battle of Parangipettai or Porto novo.\n\n1782: Hyder Ali died due to illness, possibly cancer. His son, Tipu Sultan took over the reins and continued his father\u2019s aggressive policies in the battles.\n\n1783: \u00a0Tipu pushed back the EIC, took over Mangalore, and stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper, and cardamom to Europe.\n\n1784: The French withdrew their naval support of Mysore and the EIC got instructions from London to end the war. The Treaty of Mangalore was signed between Tipu Sultan and EIC to end the second war and essentially restored the borders to the situation before the war.\n\nTipu Sultan wrote a military manual \u2018Fathul Myahidin\u2019.\n\nThird Anglo-Mysore War (1790-92)\n\nFrance was an ally of Mysore now and Tipu Sultan modernized his army with French help. They attacked the nearby Kingdom of Travancore for wealth.\n\n1789: Tipu Sultan attacked Travancore and all the alliances forged by the British against Mysore kicked into action. The English and allies were commanded by Lord Charles Cornwallis who was the Governor-General of EIC from 1786.\n\nThis war was long-drawn and went on for three years.\n\n1792: The siege of Srirangapatam forced Tipu to surrender and Mysore lost its capital. The terms of the Treaty of Seringapatam were harsh:\n\nTipu Sultan was obliged to give up a large slice of his kingdom\nHe had to agree to pay the EIC regular \u2018protection\u2019 money\nMysore released all prisoners of war\nFinally, Tipu had to leave two of his sons with the Company as hostages.\nFourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798-99)\n\nTipu sultan once again tried to regain control of his territories in alliance with the French. He has even written to Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) to send him an army, but Napoleon was busy attacking the British in Egypt at the time.\n\nThe British saw the French-Mysore alliance as a threat to their dominance in the sub-continent. The task of breaking this alliance was taken up by the new EIC Governor-General, Lord Richard Wellesley (appointed 1798), who was the most aggressive governor yet.\n\nWellesley had the continued backing of the Maratha Confederacy and the Nizam of Hyderabad whose army was led by Arthur Wellesley (future Duke of Wellington and victor at Waterloo).\n\n1799: In the final siege of Srirangapatam, Tipu was attacked from all sides. Tipu Sultan was killed in action, and his remaining family members were exiled.\n\nMysore signed a treaty with the EIC in 1799, and the state, now much reduced in the territory, came under British rule through their reinstallation of a puppet ruler, Krishna Raja Wadiyar III of the traditional Wadiyar ruling family.\n\nThis was the second instance of a subsidiary alliance started by Wellesley in 1798. The first Indian ruler to sign the Subsidiary Alliance was the Nizam of Hyderabad.\nThe British entirely took over the administration of Mysore in 1831, but the puppet ruler of Wodiyar remained.\nThe Wodeyars ruled the remnant Kingdom of Mysore until 1947 when it joined the Dominion of India.\nImpact of the Anglo-Mysore Wars\n\nThe French presence in India was almost fully removed by the end of 1799, hence cementing British dominance.\n\nThe fearsome and determined campaigning of Tipu Sultan however cast a shadow over the British psyche, and the Anglo-Mysore was becoming a tale of legendary battles.\n\nThe Battles of Plassey (1757) and Buxar (1764) secured British rule over East India.\n\nThe Anglo-Mysore Wars, the Anglo-Maratha Wars (1767\u20131799), and eventually the Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845\u20131849) solidified the British claim over South Asia, leading to the British Empire in India.\n\nAlso, on the artillery front, the British East India Company had never seen anything like the Mysorean rockets Tipu deployed during the Battle of Pollilur.\n\nThis was primarily because they utilized iron tubes to contain the fuel.\nAs a result, the missile\u2019s thrust could be increased and its range extended up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles).\nThey had an impact on British rocket development after Tipu\u2019s final defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the seizure of many Mysorean iron rockets, which led to the Congreve rocket, which was quickly used in the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

As a peninsular subcontinent with more than 7000 km of coastline, India was ordained to be a maritime nation. Read here to learn about the rich maritime heritage of India.\n\nIndia has a long history of maritime trade, and the Rig Veda has the oldest mention of nautical operations. There are many stories in Indian mythology about the ocean, the sea, and the rivers, and it is thought that mankind has benefited from the abundance of the seas and ocean.\n\nThere is a tonne of proof supporting the presence of Indian maritime traditions that can be found in Indian literature, art, sculpture, painting, and archaeology.\n\nThe Indian subcontinent ruled the Indian Ocean from very early times until the 13th century, according to a study of the nation\u2019s maritime history. Instead of doing so for political reasons, Indians went to the sea for trade and commerce.\n\nHence, from around the 16th century on, there was calm seaborne trade, as well as cultural and traditional contact between countries.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMaritime History: The Early days\nMaritime History of India: Nandas and Mauryas (500-200 BCE)\nMaritime History: Satavahanas (200-220 CE)\nThe golden age of the Gupta dynasty (320-500 CE)\nMaritime History of India: Southern dynasties\nArab advent through maritime trade\nMaritime History of India: The Europeans\nThe arrival of the Portuguese\nThe Dutch\nThe British\nThe French\nMaritime History of India: The Marathas\nMaritime India: The British Raj\nMaritime History of India: Post-Independence\nConclusion\nRelated Posts\nMaritime History: The Early days\n\nThe beginning of India\u2019s maritime history dates back to 3000 BCE.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nDuring this time, the inhabitants of Indus Valley Civilisation had a maritime trade link with Mesopotamia.\nThe excavation at Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa has revealed ample evidence that maritime activities flourished during this period.\nThe discovery of a dry dock at Lothal (about 400 km Southwest of Ahmedabad) gives an insight into the knowledge of tides, winds, and other nautical factors that existed during that period.\nThe dry dock at Lothal dates back to 2400 BCE and is regarded as the first such facility, anywhere in the world, equipped to berth and service ships.\nShips from Lothal traded with China in the far east to both coasts of Africa.\nTrade with Babylon and Mediterranean regions was carried out through the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.\n\nModern oceanographers have observed that the Harappans possessed great knowledge of tides, hydrography, and maritime engineering to build a dock on the ever-shifting course of the Sabarmati River.\n\nIron was NOT used during the Indus valley civilization, hence the ships were made of teak from the region of modern-day Kerala.\n\nThey were made of teak, stitched together using coir yarn usually dipped in fish oil.\nThese ships did not have masts, rather they were steered by large oars.\nThere are numerous mentions in the Rig Veda about \u2018Sataritara\u2019 or the galley with hundred oars.\n\nVedic literature has numerous references to boats, ships, and sea voyages.\n\nThe Rig Veda is the oldest evidence on record that refers to Varuna, the Lord of the Sea, and credits him with the knowledge of the ocean routes which were used by ships.\nThe Rig Veda mentions merchants sailing ships across the oceans to foreign countries in quest of trade and wealth.\nThe epics Ramayana and Mahabharata have references to ships and sea travels. Even the Puranas have several stories of sea voyages.\n\nDuring 1500-1000 BCE, the ancient city of Dwarka was the gateway of Indian ships to the west to trade with Syria and Cyprus.\n\nArchaeological research in the area has found evidence of iron implements in sea anchors attached to ocean-going ships from the period.\nMaritime History of India: Nandas and Mauryas (500-200 BCE)\n\nThe age of the Nandas and Mauryas saw extensive maritime trading activities that brought many nations closer to India. This resulted in the spread of India\u2019s culture and religious beliefs to other countries.\n\nThe maritime activities of the Mauryas paved the way for Indian immigration to Indonesia and other surrounding islands.\n\nDuring this period, India witnessed an invasion by Alexander.\n\nThe Greek and Roman literary records give sufficient evidence about maritime trade during the days of the Nanda and Maurya empires.\nMegasthenes, the Greek ethnographer and Macedonian ambassador to Chandragupta Maurya, has described the administration of armed forces in Pataliputra during that period and described the presence of a special group that looked after different aspects of naval war-fighting.\nThe navy of the Magadh kingdom, therefore, is considered to be the first-ever recorded instance of a navy, anywhere in the world.\nIt was during this period that Chandragupta\u2019s minister, Chanakya, wrote the Arthashastra, which has details of the department of waterways under a Navadhyaksha (Superintendent of the ships).\nIt also has details of an admiralty division established as part of the \u2018war office\u2019, which was responsible for navigation on the oceans, lakes, and seas.\nDetails of different types of boats maintained during the Mauryan rule and their purpose have also been included in the book.\n\nDuring the rule of Ashoka the Great, the Mauryan Empire covered almost the entire Indian subcontinent, and trade relationships existed with Sri Lanka, Egypt, Syria, and Macedonia.\n\nOne of the famous legacies of Ashoka remains the spread of Buddhism.\nThere is evidence that Ashoka\u2019s son, Mahendra, and daughter, Sanghamitra, had sailed from Tamralipti in West Bengal to Ceylon carrying a sapling of the holy Banyan tree as a gift, for the spread of Buddhism.\nAshoka also sent envoys to various kingdoms in Southeast Asia using the sea route.\nMaritime History: Satavahanas (200-220 CE)\n\nThe Satavahanas (200 BC \u2013 220 CE) ruled the Deccan region and their kingdom spread over parts of present-day Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Saurashtra in Gujarat.\n\nThey controlled the East coast of India, along the Bay of Bengal, and had healthy trade with the Roman Empire.\nThe Satavahanas were the first native Indian rulers to issue their coins with inscriptions of ships.\nEvidence also exists of the spread of culture, language, and Hinduism to various parts of Southeast Asia through the sea route.\nThe golden age of the Gupta dynasty (320-500 CE)\n\nThe Gupta Empire stretched across northern, central, and parts of southern India between 320 to 550 CE.\n\nThis period has been called the \u2018Golden Age of India\u2019. Chandra Gupta I, Samudra Gupta, and Chandra Gupta II were the most notable rulers of the Gupta dynasty.\n\nFa-Hien, the Chinese monk, who came to India in 399 CE to study Buddhism at Bodhgaya, Sarnath, and Varanasi, had given an eyewitness account of the Gupta Empire.\n\nWith the expansion of overseas commerce, the Gupta period witnessed an era of general prosperity, economic progress, cultural extension, artistic attainment, and architectural advancement.\nFa-Hien on his way back to his homeland, in 413 CE, sailed from Tamralipti in Bengal and 14 days later reached Ceylon where he embarked for Java and passed through Nicobars and the Strait of Malacca to reach the Pacific.\nThe oceanic navigation which was well advanced during the earlier centuries of the Christian era is borne out from Fa-Hien\u2019s writings.\n\nAnother Chinese traveler Huein Tsang, who visited India between 633-645 CE had given eyewitness accounts of the vast overseas trade during the Gupta period.\n\nRemarkable progress in astronomy was also achieved during this period.\n\nAryabhata and Varahamihira, known in history as great astronomers, belonged to this period.\nThe celestial bodies began to be accurately mapped and the art of oceanic navigation by rough and ready computation of position from known stars was established.\nDuring this period, several ports in the east and west were opened which greatly revived maritime trade with European and African countries.\nMaritime History of India: Southern dynasties\n\nThe Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas were major powers of peninsular India. These rulers had established strong maritime trade links with the local rulers of Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula, Thailand, and China.\n\nThe knowledge of the monsoon winds was also developed during sea voyages.\nDuring the Chola dynasty (3rd -13th century) extensive sea trade existed and new harbors with quarters, warehouses, and workshops were established.\nShip repair yards, wharves, and lighthouses were built along the Indian coast to support the powerful navy which protected their merchant ships.\n\nHinduism and Indian culture spread during the 5th to 12th centuries during the Sri Vijaya Empire which extended between India\u2019s eastern seaboard and the Far East (based on the island of Sumatra).\n\nThe Sri Vijayas\u2019 cultural and trading expeditions took them to far-flung areas such as Sumatra, Burma, the Malay Peninsula, Java, Thailand, and Indo-China.\nThey attracted Indian, Arab, and Chinese merchants to ports where excellent harbor facilities were available.\nAs a result of the differences between the Cholas, the Tamil kings, and the Sri Vijayas, a series of sea battles were fought between their navies towards the end of the 10th Century CE resulting in the weakening of these empires and opening the way for Arab supremacy in the region.\nIn 1007 CE, the Cholas defeated the Sri Vijayas and then ruled the Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra, and some neighboring islands.\n\nThe Pandya dynasty (6th-16th Century) was eminent Agniveer and sea traders, with links extending from the Roman empire and Egypt in the West to China in the East.\n\nThey controlled pearl farming that took place along India\u2019s southern coastline, producing some of the finest pearls of those times.\n\nThe Cheras (12th Century) had a flourishing trade with the Greeks and the Romans.\n\nThey navigated through various rivers which opened into the Arabian Sea.\nThey used monsoon winds to sail their ships directly from the Indian ports of Tyndis (present-day Periyapattanum, near Kochi) and Muziris (present-day Pattanam, also near Kochi), to ports in Arabia.\n\nThe Vijaynagar (1336\u20131646 CE) empire established strong links with various parts of Southeast Asia and spread India\u2019s culture and traditions.\n\nThis influence is visible even today in Southeast Asia, as the names of many places and people are of Indian origin.\nThese kingdoms also helped spread both Hinduism and Buddhism, cultures, and architecture in this region.\nBetween the 13th and the 15th centuries, while most of northern India was dominated by the Delhi sultanate, most parts of southern India were controlled by the Vijaynagar Empire.\nArab advent through maritime trade\n\nBy the 8th Century CE, Arabs began to come to India by the sea in great numbers as traders.\n\nOver time, many parts of modern-day West Asia became nodal points for business between Europe, Southeast Asia, and India.\nSoon the Arabs began controlling the trade routes and acted as middlemen between the West and the East.\nThe period from 900 to 1300 CE is considered the Early Age of maritime commerce in Southeast Asia.\nMaritime History of India: The Europeans\n\nThe Mughal dynasty ruled over most of northern India from 1526-1707 CE. Having found sufficient revenue from land resources, they did not pay much attention to the affairs of the sea.\n\nThis enabled the Arabs to establish a monopoly over trade in the Indian Ocean.\nHearing about the rich land called \u2018Hindustan\u2019 in the East, many European countries felt the need to find a direct sea route for trade.\nThe Portuguese took the lead and were the first Europeans to arrive on Indian shores.\nThe arrival of the Portuguese\n\nBefore the 16th century, the calm and peaceful waters of the Indian Ocean were characterized by a brisk and prosperous commercial trade in which most of the coastal and seafaring communities from East Africa to Malaysia and the Indonesian Islands participated actively.\n\nVasco da Gama (1460 \u2013 1524) was a Portuguese explorer who discovered an oceanic route from Portugal to India.\n\nSailing from Portugal, he rounded the Cape of Good Hope in Africa to arrive at Calicut in Kerala in May 1498.\nHis arrival began a new chapter in India\u2019s maritime history.\nThe calm and peaceful scene of trade was disturbed by the arrival of the Portuguese merchantmen, who set a strategy for control of the entire Indian Ocean.\nThey set up factories at Calicut, Cochin, Goa, Surat, and other west coast ports.\nThey also took control of all important Ports namely Hormuz, Socotra, Aden, and Malacca to effectively seize the Indian Ocean trade flow, thereby displaying the Arab monopoly over trade in the Indian Ocean Region.\n\nThe Zamorins, with their capital at Calicut, a major trading port had flourishing trade over land and through seas.\n\nOn Vasco da Gama\u2019s arrival at Calicut, the Zamorin ruler granted permission to the Portuguese for trade.\nThis was not liked by the large settlements of Arab traders who were already trading with the Zamorins.\nWhen asked by the Zamorin king to pay the customs tariff, Vasco da Gama refused to pay it and sailed back from Calicut to return to Europe.\nThereafter, the Portuguese became friendly with the kings of Kochi and Cannanore and launched multiple assaults on the Zamorin ports. The Zamorins resisted the Portuguese for over a century.\nDuring this period of resistance, Kunjali Marakkars, the Naval commanders of that time, proved their tactical acumen and valor on many occasions. Kunjali Marakkar was the title given to the naval chief of the Zamorin king.\nThere were four major Kunjalis who played their part in the Zamorin\u2019s naval wars with the Portuguese between 1502 and 1600. Of the four Marakkars, Kunjali Marakkar II is the most famous.\nThe Kunjali Marakkars are credited with organizing the first naval defense of the Indian coast and they prevented the Portuguese from establishing a foothold on the Malabar Coast for more than 90 years.\n\nIn 1509, Alfonso de Albuquerque was appointed Portuguese Governor in Kochi. Having failed to defeat the Zamorin, Albuquerque seized Goa and its surrounding areas by defeating the Sultan of Bijapur (present-day Karnataka) in 1510. Thereafter, Goa became the headquarters of Portuguese India and the seat of the Portuguese Viceroy.\n\nThe Dutch\n\nThe Dutch East India Company, established in 1592 in Amsterdam, Netherlands, sailed their first merchant fleet that reached India in 1595. Apart from textiles, the Dutch traded precious stones, indigo, silk, opium, cinnamon, and pepper.\n\nThe first Dutch base in the Indian Ocean Region was established in Batavia (present-day Jakarta, Indonesia).\nThey did not challenge the Portuguese and were permitted to set up a trading facility at Pulicat in 1608 which led to the formation of the Dutch Coromandel.\nSubsequently, Dutch Surat and Dutch Bengal were established in 1616 and 1627 respectively.\nThe Dutch conquered the forts on the Malabar Coast (present-day Kerala) around 1661 and established Dutch Malabar to protect Ceylon from Portuguese invasion.\n\nRead:\u00a0India-Netherlands relations\n\nThe British\n\nThe East India Company was founded in England on 31 December 1600. A ship of the company, Hector, under the command of Captain William Hawkins, arrived at Surat.\n\nCaptain William Hawkins brought with him a letter for Emperor Jahangir, seeking permission to trade with the Mughal dominions.\nThe emperor granted permission for trade and also promised other trading facilities.\nAt that time, the Portuguese were the dominant European power in India, so they did not appreciate the British arrival in India which affected their trade.\nThe French\n\nThe French arrived in the Indian Ocean Region in 1740 and established a strong base in Mauritius.\n\nEventually, they also arrived at Surat and Pondicherry where they set up their trading posts.\nIn later years, French establishments came up in Karaikal, Yanaon, Mahe, and Chandernagore (present-day Chandannagar in Bengal).\nDuring the 18th century, the French were the primary challengers to British supremacy in the Indian Ocean.\nBetween 1744 and 1766, the British and French repeatedly attacked each other to conquer forts and towns along the east coast of South India and Bengal.\nAfter a few initial French successes, the British decisively defeated the French in the Battle of Wandiwash in Tamil Nadu (1760).\n\nThe British knew the importance of the seas. In addition to taking over provinces over land, they also established a naval force that protected their sea trade and also kept adversaries at bay. Thus, a strong naval force also aided the British in ruling over India.\n\nMaritime History of India: The Marathas\n\nThe Marathas gave the strongest resistance to the British from gaining control along the Indian coasts.\n\nThe Marathas, who were under constant attacks from the Mughals, initially had no navy.\n\nShivaji was the first to realize the importance of a strong navy.\nFighting the Siddis (who had their base at Murud Janjira) and observing the Portuguese naval power along the Konkan coast, Shivaji realized the importance of having an efficient system of ports and a strong navy.\nShivaji believed in forts and built many coastal forts such as at Vijaydurg, Sindhudurg, and many others along the Konkan coast.\nHe ensured sound defense of the forts by constructing them on hillocks overlooking the coast.\nThe Maratha navy soon became stronger and established strongholds in the forts at Kolaba, Sindhudurg, Vijaydurg, and Ratnagiri.\nFor more than 40 years, the Marathas held both the Portuguese and the British at bay single-handedly.\nUnder Shivaji, the Maratha navy developed into a ferocious force with more than 500 ships.\nBut after the death of Shivaji in 1680, the Maratha navy became weak.\nMaritime India: The British Raj\n\nThe East India Company came under the British Crown in 1830 and acquired combatant status. The service was then named the Indian Navy. It was renamed Her Majesty\u2019s Indian Navy in 1858.\n\nIn 1863, it was reorganized into two branches; one in Bombay and the other at Calcutta, as the Bombay Marine and the Bengal Marine.\nThe protection of Indian waters was then taken over by the Royal Navy.\nThe Royal Indian Marine (RIM) was constituted in 1892.\nDuring World War I, RIM was assigned tasks such as marine survey, maintenance of lighthouses, and transportation of troops.\nSoon after the end of World War I in 1918, the strength of the Royal Indian Marine was reduced by the British government in India.\nIn 1934, this Service was renamed the Royal Indian Navy (RIN), with its headquarters in Bombay.\nDuring the initial phase of World War II, Royal Indian Navy maintained a sea-going squadron of six escort vessels to cooperate with the Royal Navy and undertook the responsibility of local naval defense.\nMaritime History of India: Post-Independence\n\nPost-independence, the Royal Indian Navy was divided into the Royal Indian Navy and the Royal Pakistan Navy.\n\nIn 1958, Vice Admiral R D Katari, become the first Indian Naval Officer to take over as the Chief of the Naval Staff of the Indian Navy.\nTwo-thirds of the Royal Indian Navy\u2019s assets remained with India and the balance went to Pakistan Navy.\n\nWith India becoming a Republic on 26 January 1950, the prefix \u2018Royal\u2019 was dropped and it was rechristened as the Indian Navy.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe maritime history of India as mentioned in this article spanned centuries. Seafaring in India has a long tradition since the late Chalcolithic period and was the major vessel that spread the cultural heritage of the nation globally.\n\nThe modern shipping and maritime sector is extremely important for the economic growth of the country. With a coastline of more than 7500 km, maritime trade and security are critical for the nation.\n\nRelated Posts\nSagar Sampark DGNSS\nMaritime Security Challenges: Major Threat to India\nHistory of Shipbuilding\n\n\u00adArticle written by Swathi Satish"

Invaders desired to colonise India primarily because of its enormous wealth, agricultural potential, the spice trade, fertile river valleys, etc. Each foreign conqueror in India ruthlessly exploited the populace since India had an abundance of human resources.\n\nThe following information is about the foreign invaders who came to India in chronological sequence.\n\nAryan Invasion (1800-1500 BCE)\nPersian\u00a0\u00a0invasions(535 BC )\nAlexander\u2019s Invasion(336 BC -323 BC)\nInvasion of Seleucid(305 -303 BC)\nIndo-Greek Invasion (180 BC)\nHuna Invasion(458 AD)\nArab Invasion by Mohammed Bin Kasim (712 AD)\nTurkish Invasion by Mahmud of Ghazni (1001 AD)\nTurkish Invasion by Muhammed of Ghur (1175\u00a0 AD)\nMongol Invasion\u00a0 (1206-1368 AD)\nThe Invasion of Mughals (1526-1761 AD)\nThe Invasion of Nadir Shah (1736 -1747\u00a0 AD)\nThe European Invasions\nDetails of\u00a0Foreign Invasion in India\n\nEach of the following foreign invasions in India will be discussed here.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nThe Aryan Invasion\n\nAryans are thought to have invaded India for the first time ever.\n\nThey are a collection of Indo-European nomadic tribes. As the Aryans invaded and settled in the Indus River Valley, the Indus Valley Civilization was flourishing in the Indo-Gangetic Plains. They eventually colonised the Deccan region as well as moving towards the South of India. According to legend, each of these occurrences took place between 1800 and 1500 B.C.\n\nINFLUENCE AND RESULTS OF THE ARYAN INVASION\n\nIt is obvious that the Aryan Conquest left a lasting impression on Indian culture. Here is a list of a few of them:\n\nThe first group to divide society into the four major castes of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras were the Aryans.\nThere were numerous sub-castes that were further classified into the four main castes.\nUntouchables were all individuals who did not belong to a subcaste. They were regarded as the lowest-ranking members of society.\nA person\u2019s occupation was decided by his caste.\nThe majority of the inhabitants spoke Sanskrit or other comparable languages following the Aryan Conquest.\n\nThe original Aryan Invasion Theory is no longer widely accepted in its classical form. Instead, the Aryan Migration Theory has gained more scholarly consensus, though it remains an area of active research, especially with the inclusion of new genetic, linguistic, and archaeological data.\n\nPersian\u00a0\u00a0invasions\n\nNorth West India had several small tribal republics in the early half of the sixth century BC. There was no centralised authority to reconcile these warring tribes. The political unrest in the region was exploited by the Achaemenid kings of Iran or Persia. The founding member of the Achaemenid dynasty, Cyrus, and his son Darius I gained portions of Punjab and Sindh.\n\nIt was considered to be the most populated and productive part of the Achaemenid empire. Also included in the Achaemenid army were people from India. Northwestern India was ruled by the Persians for about two centuries. During this time, there must have been frequent communication between the two areas. Perhaps increased trade and commerce between Persia and India as a result of Skylax\u2019s maritime trip.\n\nAlexander or Greek Invasion\n\nAlexander the Great\u2019s invasion of India was one of the earliest significant foreign incursions. Alexander III was the state of Macedon\u2019s first Greek ruler. But over time, he is claimed to have taken control of the majority of the Ancient World. In 326 B.C., he also invaded India. In the Battle of Jhelum, also known as Hydaspes, which took place close to the Jhelum River\u2019s banks, he overcame King Porus. Alexander\u2019s army advanced after capturing much of the Punjab region. Yet the Nanda Empire, which ruled over North and East India, was fully prepared to engage its army in combat.\n\nThe tired Alexander\u2019s soldiers made the decision to abandon the attack, citing the formidable Nanda Empire force. Alexander\u2019s conquest of India came to a halt as a result.\n\nIMPACT AND CONSEQUENCES OF ALEXANDER\u2019S INVASION\nIt provided a direct connection between India and the European nations.\nRegarding the cultural impact, the Greek invasion of India was responsible for the founding of the Indo-Greek Gandhara School of Art.\nBefore the Greek Invasion, the majority of north India was governed by petty kingdoms. The destruction of the minor kingdoms, however, allowed the Mauryan Empire to quickly seize control of all of northern India after the invasion.\nFour important commercial routes became accessible after the Greek invasion.\nThe history of Alexander\u2019s invasion made it easier for historians to follow the sequence of events that took place in ancient India.\nInvasion of Seleucid\n\nFrom 305 and 303 B.C., the Seleucid army is claimed to have invaded India. Emperor Chandragupta Maurya of the Maurya Empire engaged the Seleucus I Nicator of the Seleucid Empire in combat. By putting their differences aside and negotiating a peace, both parties gained from the war\u2019s end. As a result, Seleucid started to focus more on his western incursions. Alexander the Great\u2019s general at the time was Seleucid. He later succeeded in retaking a sizable portion of Alexander\u2019s former conquests.\n\nIMPACTS AND CONSEQUENCES\nThe signing of the Indus Valley Treaty.\nThe Mauryan Empire\u2019s dominance and power were increased in India as a result of this invasion.\nMagasthenes advocated for cordial and mutually beneficial diplomatic relations.\nThe Seleucid army benefited from the gift of war elephants in other conflicts and wars.\nGreek-Indo invasion\n\nBeginning of the Greek invasion of India In 180 B.C., the Graeco-Bactrian king Demetrius invaded India. He took control of the majority of Punjab and the southern regions of Afghanistan. For roughly 30 years, the Indo- Greek Kingdom ruled. The cultures of the people who lived during this time were a fusion of Greek and Indian.\n\nIMPACT AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE INDO-GREEK INVASION\nDuring this time, a blend of Greek and Indian cultures flourished.\nThe Greek king engraved images of Indian gods on the coins in circulation at the time to placate the Indian populace.\nSince the majority of the kings were Buddhists during the Indo-Greek era, Buddhism flourished.\nHuna\u00a0 invasions\n\nThe Hephthalites were the nomadic savages or tribes that inhabited the area around China (the Sanskrit name of which is Hunas). According to studies, the Hunas ruled from Khotan in Central Asia to the Persian border. Two Huna branches moved in the direction of the west. The Hunas split into two groups, one travelling to the Roman Empire and the other to India. The White Hunas were the name given to the Huna branch that migrated to India. About a hundred years after the Kushanas invaded, the Hunas began their invasion of India. The Huna tribe was regarded as one of the most belligerent and ruthless tribes in historical investigations. There were two significant Huna invasions.\n\nIMPACT AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE HUNA\u00a0INVASION\nThe Hunas had first overthrown the Gupta Empire\u2019s hegemony in India and over their feudatories.\nIn the ashes of the Gupta Empire, little kingdoms started to flourish and thrive.\nWith the Huna invasion, which entirely destroyed the Gupta economy, the trade ties between the Guptas in India and the Roman\nEmpire deteriorated as well. Cities with a rich cultural heritage and economy, like Pataliputra or Ujjain, suffered as a result.\nUnder the later Guptas, sociopolitical and economic conditions also declined.\nOne of the most important consequences of the Huna invasion was ethnic mingling in India.\nThe martial arts of the Hunas were originally brought to Indian civilization.\nMohammad Bin Kasim\u2019s Arab Invasion\n\nMohammed Bin Kasim commanded the first Arab invasion of India that was successful, which took place in the year 712 AD. There had previously been 16 unsuccessful efforts by other Muslim Arab monarchs to take over the wealthy nation. Sindh and areas of Punjab were subjugated by Mohammad Bin Kasim. He was unable to extend his success past Hyderabad and Multan, though.\n\nIMPACTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF MOHAMMED BIN KASIM\u2019S ARAB INVASION\nMohammed Bin Kasim\u2019s attack on India allowed for greater religious tolerance in the nation.\nAs a result, there is now a connection between Indian subcontinental Vedic civilisation and Islamic civilization.\nCultural and value exchanges between the two cultures grew in importance.\nAround this time, several outstanding Indian literary masterpieces were translated into Arabic.\nInvasion of the Turks by Mahmud of Ghazni\n\nThe riches and fertile Gangetic plains of India enticed Mahmud of Ghazni into making the decision to invade. He is alleged to have launched about 17 raids and assaults against India between 1001 and 1025 AD. History demonstrates that Mahmud of Ghazni was more concerned with robbing and stealing wealth than with establishing his rule.\n\nCONSEQUENCES AND IMPACTS OF MAHMUD OF GHAZNI\u2019S INVASION\nThe lives of residents in the northern regions of the country were forever changed by his incursions. Moreover, Punjab was given to a sultan of the Ghazni Dynasty.\nThousands of great temples were pillaged for their entire contents.\nHe helped chess become more popular in India.\nEven though he frequently pillaged India\u2019s wealth, he showed interest in establishing libraries and other buildings and had respect for intelligent people.\nTurkish Invasion by Muhammed of Ghur\n\nBetween 1175 to 1206, Shihabud Din Muhammad of Ghori, or Muhammad of Ghur attacked India several times. Despite earlier Muslim conquests, it was Muhammad Ghori who, after numerous assaults, was able to establish the Muslim Empire in the nation. The Turkish invasion of Muhammad Ghur, when combined with the earlier incursions carried out by Mahmud of Ghazni, proved to have a major impact on medieval Indian history.\n\nIMPACTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF MUHAMMAD OF GHUR\u2019S OTTOMAN INVASION\nLittle princely states\u2019 rule came to an end as a result of the invasion of Ghori.\nDuring their rule, a centralised administration policy was initially implemented.\nTrade ties with other countries expanded significantly.\nThe Slave Dynasty gradually developed to its full potential.\nMongol Invasion\n\nThe most significant Mongol invasions include the invasion of Chengis khan and Timur.\n\nATTACK OF CHENGIZ KHAN\n\nThe Mongol invasion of India is thought to have included Chengiz Khan\u2019s invasion of India. In the year 1221, he engaged in conflict with Jalal-ad-realm Din. The Sultanate of Delhi\u2019s Iltumish was in charge during the time.\n\nImpacts and Consequences of Chengiz Khan\u2019s Invasion\n\nHe is honoured to have established the first postal service in history.\nDespite the fact that his rule is notorious for bloodshed, he promoted trade and religious freedom.\nHe even made efforts to stop torturing his subjects.\nTIMUR\u2019S INVASION\n\nTimur Lane, an Uzbek commander of the Mongols, claimed to be a descendant of Genghis Khan and converted to Islam.\nIn August 1398, Timur led a sizable cavalry force of 92,000 soldiers in a march towards India. Muhammad Shah, the final Tughlaq sultan, was in power when he landed in Delhi.\n\nIn 1399, Timur landed in Delhi as a conqueror. He consented to save the lives of the people in return for a sizable ransom.\nTimur ordered a widespread killing, which resulted in the destruction of Delhi, but the Hindus rebelled as a result of the soldiers\u2019 actions when gathering supplies. Timur only spent 15 days in Delhi before he withdrew with a significant number of slaves and loot. In doing so, he left behind tales of terror and destruction, as well as starvation and pestilence, and installed Khizar Khan as governor of Multan, Lahore, and Dipalpur.\n\nImpacts and Consequences of Chengiz Khan\u2019s Invasion\n\nThe nation of India was in disarray when Timur fled.\nThe complete destruction of grain stocks and standing crops caused famine and plague, and it took Delhi more than 50 years to recover from the damage.\nMany cities and sizable villages had been put to rubble, thousands of innocent people had been mercilessly slaughtered, and the regional government had been totally upended.\nThe Mughal invasion\n\nAfter Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodhi of the Delhi Sultanate in the first battle of Panipat in the year 1526, the Mughals entered India. For over 200 years, the Mughals dominated the Indian subcontinent. Despite their arrival as conquerors, the Mughals did not live or rule as one. Under their rule, various magnificent works in the arts, literature, sculpture, and administrative procedures were produced.\n\nIMPACTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE MUGHAL INVASION\nExpanded commercial connections with other nations. During this time, Indian products were in high demand.\nThe Mughal era saw the construction of some of the world\u2019s greatest architectural marvels, including the Taj Mahal, Red Fort, Agra Fort, and others.\nRoad construction is promoted by the Mughals for infrastructure.\nHuman rights were respected by administrative policies.\nNader Shah\u2019s invasion of India\n\nThe King of Persia and founder of the Iranian Afsharid dynasty of Persia, Nadir Shah (1736\u201347), first attacked Northern India before marching into Delhi. In the Battle of Karnal, his army easily defeated the Mughals, and as a result, it later took control of the Mughal capital.\n\nNone of Aurangzeb\u2019s successors was able to fill the void that his passing left in the Mughal empire. Because of ongoing battles for the throne and ministerial betrayal, the empire had weakened.\nKing of Persia Nadir Shah, who came up through the dacoit ranks, saw an opening in the weak nation. Then, in 1738, Nadir Shah invaded India. When a Persian diplomat was insulted by Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah at Delhi\u2019s royal court, the invasion was authorised.\n\nThe Governor of Punjab asked the Mughal empire to strengthen Punjab\u2019s defences before Nadir Shah reached the Khyber Pass, but the then-Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah ignored his honest plea. Muhammad Shah, sensing a danger shortly after Nadir Shah entered Punjab, dispatched Khan Dauran and Nizam-ul-Mulk to lead the Mughal army against Nadir Shah. Muhammad Shah was forced to take command of the army himself after both were beaten.\n\nAt Karnal, when the two armies battled, the Mughal forces were quickly surrounded and defeated.\nThe Mughal army was in disarray after its defeat. By serving as a middleman, The Nizam convinced Nadir Shah to go back to Persia in exchange for 20 million rupees. Nizam impressed the Mughal emperor, who gave him the title of \u201cAmir-Ul-Umra\u201d and made him prime minister.\n\nCONSEQUENCES AND INFLUENCE\nThe entire city of Delhi was destroyed, pillaged, looted, and ruined by Nadir Shah\u2019s troops.\nThe Peacock throne built by Shah Jahan was transported by Nadir Shah. The legendary \u201cKoh-i-noor\u201d diamond was also taken by him.\nIn addition, he stole 6 million rupees\u2019 worth of cash, 600 million rupees\u2019 worth of jewellery, and 10 million rupees\u2019 worth of gold.\nThe damage this invasion did to the Mughal Empire was disastrous. Mughal lands were seized by the Persians.\nBetween 1748 and 1758, Ahmad Shah Abdali repeatedly invaded India and attacked Delhi, following in Nadir Shah\u2019s footsteps.\nThe European & British Invasions\n\nVasco Da Gama\u2019s arrival in Portugal in 1498 marked the beginning of the colonisation of India, but it wasn\u2019t until the advent of the East India Company (British) that India became a true colony. The British initially arrived in India for trade but later ruled it for nearly two centuries. The British used trade to take over and govern the entire Indian subcontinent, plundering it of all its riches and goodness.\n\nEUROPEAN INVASION: ITS CONSEQUENCES AND INFLUENCE\nThey stripped India of all its resources through economic exploitation.\nThey provided sovereignty to the nation, and they were responsible for the introduction of modern transportation and communication systems.\nThe emergence of numerous social reform movements led by eminent people.\nConclusion\n\nForeign Invasions in India is consistent since the beginning of time from the Aryan Invasion to the British Invasion. India eventually gained independence from all of these powers despite being conquered and ruled by numerous different world leaders. We now lead proud lives, reflecting on the past while working daily to elevate the stature of our nation. Foreign invasions contributed to the Indian subcontinent\u2019s political union as well as the expansion of trade, commerce, art, and culture.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas\u00a0"

        "[CONTENT]": "Siddhartha Gautama, also known as Gautama Buddha, was a traveling monk and spiritual guide who founded Buddhism during the sixth or fifth century BCE. Read here to know the biography of Gautama Buddha.\n\nGautama Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything.\n\nSiddhartha Gautama was, according to legend, a Hindu prince who renounced his position and wealth to seek enlightenment as a spiritual ascetic, attained his goal and, in preaching his path to others, founded Buddhism in India in the 6th-5th centuries BCE.\n\nBuddha was born during a time of social and religious transformation. The dominant religion in India at the time was Hinduism (Sanatan Dharma, \u201cEternal Order\u201d) but several thinkers of the period had begun to question its validity and the authority of the Vedas as well as the practices of the priests.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe early life of Gautama Buddha\nJourney of Buddha\nThe great departure or renunciation\nThe great enlightenment\nThe great passing\nSymbols of Buddha\u2019s life\n\u00a0Conclusion\nThe early life of Gautama Buddha\n\nAccording to tradition, Siddhartha was born more than 200 years before the reign of the Maurya king Asoka (lived 304\u2013232 BCE).\n\nSiddhartha was born in Lumbini in modern-day Nepal. His father was Suddhodana, the chief of the Shakya nation, one of several ancient tribes in the growing state of Kosala. His mother was Queen Maya, King Sudhodhana\u2019s wife.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nOn the night Gautama was conceived, Mayadevi dreamt that a white elephant entered her side, and following the dream, Siddhartha was born.\n\nDuring the birth celebrations, the seer Asita announced that this baby would either become a great king (chakravartin) or a great holy man. His father, King Suddhodana, wished for Siddhartha Gautama to be a great king, and shielded his son from religious teachings or knowledge of human suffering.\n\nWhen the prince reached the age of 16, his father arranged his marriage to Yasodhara, from an elite family of the same age. In time, she gave birth to a son, Rahula.\n\nSiddhartha Gautama spent 29 years as a prince in Kapilavastu, a place now situated in Nepal. Although his father ensured that the prince was provided with everything he could want or need, he felt that material wealth was not the ultimate goal of life.\n\nJourney of Buddha\n\nThe journey of Siddhartha the Prince to Gautama buddha is largely divided into three stages- the great departure, the great enlightenment, and the great passing.\n\nThe great departure or renunciation\n\nSiddhartha\u2019s father did not want him to experience anything other than luxuries as he grew which might inspire him to adopt a spiritual path. But eventually, the prince ventured out of the palace and experienced, what is called the four signs which changed his path forever.\n\nDuring his 29th year, the prince slipped through his father\u2019s defenses and saw the four signs in the outside world-\n\nAn aged man\nA sick man\nA dead man\nA religious ascetic\n\nThrough these signs, he realized that he, too, could become sick, would grow old, would die, and would lose everything he loved. He understood that the life he was living guaranteed he would suffer and, further, that all of life was essentially defined by suffering from want or loss.\n\nSiddhartha disturbed by these sightings and realization renounced his luxurious life, wife, son, and family at the age of 29. He left the palace on his favorite horse, Kanthaka for a life dedicated to learning how to overcome suffering.\n\nHe meditated with two hermits, and, although he achieved high levels of meditative consciousness, he was still not satisfied with his path.\n\nHe began his training in the ascetic life and practiced vigorous techniques of physical and mental austerity. Gautama proved quite adept at these practices and surpassed even his teachers.\n\nHowever, he found no answer to his questions regarding freedom from suffering. Leaving behind his teachers, he and a small group of close companions set out to take their austerities even further.\n\nGautama tried to find enlightenment through the complete deprivation of worldly goods, including food, and became a complete ascetic. After nearly starving himself to death, Gautama began to reconsider his path.\n\nThe great enlightenment\n\nHe finally reached Gaya in modern-day Bihar where he seated himself under a Bodhi tree and meditated.\n\nFinally, in a moment of illumination, he understood that suffering was caused by the human insistence on permanent states of being in a world of impermanence.\n\nOne suffers because they are unaware that life is changing, and they may stop suffering by understanding that believing anything will last or being attached to it is a grave mistake that will keep them stuck in a never-ending cycle of desire, effort, rebirth, and death.\n\nHis illumination was complete, and Siddhartha Gautama was now the Buddha, the enlightened one.\n\nAlthough he could now live his life in contentment, he chose instead to teach others the path of liberation from ignorance and desire and assist them in ending their suffering.\n\nHe preached his first sermon at the Deer Park at Sarnath at which he introduced his audience to his Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. The Four Noble Truths are:\n\nLife is suffering\nThe cause of suffering is craving\nThe end of suffering comes with an end to craving\nThere is a path that leads one away from craving and suffering\n\nThe fourth truth directs one toward the Eightfold Path, which serves as a guide to living one\u2019s life without the kind of attachment that guarantees to suffer:\n\nRight View\nRight Intention\nRight Speech\nRight Action\nRight Livelihood\nRight Effort\nRight Mindfulness\nRight Concentration\n\nFor the remaining 45 years of his life, the Buddha is said to have traveled in the Gangetic Plain of Northeastern India and Southern Nepal, teaching his doctrine and discipline to everyone from nobles to outcast street sweepers, including many adherents of rival philosophies and religions.\n\nThe Buddha founded the community of Buddhist monks and nuns (the Sangha) to continue the dispensation after his Parinirvana or \u201ccomplete Nirvana\u201d, and made thousands of converts. His religion was open to all races and classes and had no caste structure.\n\nThe great passing\n\nAccording to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Pali canon, at the age of 80, the Buddha announced that he would soon enter Parinirvana, or the final deathless state abandoning the earthly body.\n\nHe died in Kusinara.\n\nThe Buddha\u2019s body was cremated and the relics were placed in monuments or stupas, some of which are believed to have survived until the present.\n\nSymbols of Buddha\u2019s life\n\nThe great events of the life of the Buddha, are important milestones in the life of Siddhartha Gautama which are represented by various symbols.\n\nThe birth of buddha is represented by the lotus flower representing purity, beauty, and spiritual growth.\nThe renunciation is depicted by his horse, Kanthaka.\nThe great enlightenment is depicted by the Bodhi tree.\nThe first sermon is represented by the wheel of dharma.\nThe mahaparinirvana is depicted by the stupa.\n\u00a0Conclusion\n\nBuddha urged his pupils to examine his teachings and validate them through personal experience throughout his life. Buddhism is still characterized by this lack of dogmatism today.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

That assignment could be very specific, such as finding out a certain truth or fixing a specific issue.\nTo make recommendations for actions in situations requiring specialist knowledge or technical judgement, expert persons are chosen.\nImportant Educational commissions and committees during British rule in India\nBritish education policy was dualistic, emphasising western education and the English language while discouraging the prevalent oriental educational system.\nThe British East India Company initially had little interest in enhancing the educational system because its main priorities were trade and financial gain. They intended to educate a small percentage of the high and middle classes in India to create a class that was \u201cIndian in blood and colour, but English in taste.\u201d\nThey were asked to serve as the government\u2019s and the general public\u2019s interpreters. The \u201cdownward filtration theory\u201d was the name given to this. Additionally, the Hunter Commission will be used to discuss everything.\nCharles Wood Despatch \u2013 1854 \u2013 Lord Dalhousie\nThe purpose of Wood\u2019s despatch was to enhance the educational system by offering several proposals.\nThe government\u2019s approach was said to be intended to promote western education by the guidelines. He placed a strong emphasis on European education in the liberal arts, sciences, philosophy, and literature in his dispatch.\nThe Wood\u2019s Despatch\u2019s motto was, in essence, the spread of European wisdom.\nThe message states that English would be the primary language of instruction for higher education.\nHowever, Wood did not downplay the importance of the vernacular language since he thought that it may serve as a vehicle for spreading European knowledge to the general public.\nAt the most basic level, Wood\u2019s Despatch also recommended establishing several local primary schools in the villages.\nAdditionally, the district level should have Anglo-Vernacular high schools and an affiliated college.\nA system of grants-in-aid was suggested by Wood\u2019s Despatch to promote and encourage private entrepreneurship in the field of education.\nThe institution has to hire qualified teachers and uphold appropriate teaching standards to get aid payments.\nHunter Commission \u2013 1882 \u2013 Lord Ripon\nViceroy Lord Ripon made the appointment.\nThe Hunter Education Commission was a historic body whose goals were to investigate concerns about the Wood\u2019s Despatch of 1854 not being implemented, assess the current state of elementary education in the British territories, and provide recommendations for how to expand and improve it.\nSir William Wilson Hunter is in charge. In 1882, he submitted the report.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nAt the high school level, there should be two different sorts of educational arrangements, with an emphasis on providing commercial and vocational education as well as various types of literary education that will aid in admission to the university.\nArrangements are made to place a strong focus on the value of primary education, as well as education in the local language and practical topics.\nThough primary education should be provided without him, private efforts in the sphere of education should be encouraged.\nThe district and city boards should be given authority over primary education.\nRaleigh Commission \u2013 1902 \u2013 Lord Curzon\nRaleigh Commission was chosen on January 27, 1902, when Sir Thomas Raleigh served as its president.\nGoal: To conduct research on the state and future of Indian universities and to make recommendations for strengthening their governance and operations.\nThe Commission was unable to report on either primary or secondary education.\nThe Commission\u2019s report and recommendations led to the passage of the Indian Universities Act in 1904.\nThe Act\u2019s primary goal is to enhance the state of education in India and raise the bar for the system.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nUniversities had the authority to choose their employees, including the faculty. A university could have no more than 50 to 100 fellows.\nFor the universities in Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta, there would be 20 elected fellows, while there would be 15 for the other universities.\nNow, the Governor-General might determine the territorial bounds of a university as well as the affiliation between universities and colleges.\nAlthough there were fewer colleges when the University Act\u2019s provisions went into effect, there were still a lot more students.\nGovernment Resolution on Education Policy \u2013 1913\nThe progressive state of Baroda made primary education mandatory throughout all of its boundaries in 1906.\nThe government declined to take on the responsibility of compulsory education in its 1913 Resolution on Education Policy, but it accepted the policy of eliminating illiteracy and urged provincial governments to start early efforts to provide free elementary education to the poorer and more disadvantaged sections.\nSadler Commission \u2013 1917 \u2013 Lord Chelmsford\nSadler Commission was established in 1917 with the mandate to investigate the \u201cconditions and prospects of the University of Calcutta.\u201d\nThe panel made numerous recommendations, including the creation of a board with complete authority over secondary and intermediate education.\nIt also suggested that excessive official control of universities be removed.\nAdditionally, it suggested that the government quit meddling in university academic affairs.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nIt is important to arrange all of the teaching materials available in Calcutta so that the university may only focus on teaching.\nDacca should host a unique teaching and residential university.\nAn organisation to act as a coordinator was required. Therefore, a Board of Universities should be established.\nThere should be Honors courses introduced, and they ought to differ significantly from Pass courses.\nThe Vice-Chancellor should be chosen to serve as the university\u2019s administrative leader on a full-time, salaried basis.\nThe Court and the Executive Council, respectively, should take the position of the Senate and the syndicate.\nExcessive government oversight should be removed from universities.\nGovernment should quit meddling in university academic affairs.\nHartog Commission \u2013 1929 \u2013 Lord Irwin\nThe British Indian government commissioned the Sir Philip Joseph Hartog Committee to research the expansion of education in India.\nMass education received greater attention from the Hartog committee in 1929 than secondary and higher education did.\nThe Hartog committee brought attention to the issue of waste and stagnation in primary education.\nInstead of expanding the number of schools, it advocated for consolidation. The introductory course was to last for a stipulated four years.\nThe quality, remuneration, and working conditions of instructors should all be improved, and the curriculum and instructional strategies should be tailored to the towns and communities where they will be used.\nTo address the issue of unemployment, the Hartog committee on education proposed that universities promote technical and business education.\nThe Hartog committee\u2019s 1929 report was an effort to stabilise and consolidate education. The government\u2019s initiative to raise educational standards was led by the Hartog committee of 1929, which was regarded as its standard-bearer.\nDue to the severe economic downturn of 1930\u20131931, this Hartog Committee of 1929 proposals stayed only on paper and were never put into action.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nAdoption of the consolidation strategy rather than building more schools.\nFixing the primary course\u2019s length at four years.\nThe quality, prestige, compensation, and working conditions of teachers are all being improved.\nRelating the teaching techniques and curricula to the circumstances in which children live and read in villages.\nModifying school schedules and vacations to meet local and seasonal needs.\nThe government should hire more inspectors.\nSargent Plan \u2013 1944 \u2013 Lord Wavell\nAfter Sir John Sargent was tasked with creating a thorough educational plan for India in 1944, the Sargent plan of education was created.\nThe goal of the plan was to establish in India, over a minimum of forty years, the same level of educational achievement as was previously recognised in England.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nPre-primary education is provided for kids between the ages of 3 and 6. All kids between the ages of 6 and 11 (junior basic) and 11 and 14 must receive universal, free, and mandatory primary or basic education (senior basic).\nSelected youngsters between the ages of 11 and 17 receive a six-year high school education.\nDegree programme lasting three years for chosen individuals beginning after the higher secondary exam\nFor full-time and part-time pupils, technical, commercial, agricultural, and artistic education is provided; domestic science is taught in females institutions.\nIn around 20 years, adult illiteracy will be eradicated and a public library system will be established.\nfull support for teachers\u2019 appropriate training.\nChildren who are physically and mentally challenged receive special education services.\nThe establishment of required physical education.\nThere should be space set aside for social and recreational pursuits.\nestablishing employment bureaus\nboth in the federal government and the states, the Department of Education was established.\nAll secondary schools must employ the mother tongue as the primary language of instruction.\nImportant Famine commissions and committees during British rule in India\n\nBritish interests in India during the British Raj were not just restricted to trade and financial gain; they also took a deep interest in social issues, but with caution and disregard. This is the only justification for their criticism of Indian cults, practices, and traditions, as well as the inadequate famine measurements that led to a series of artificial famines in India.\n\nCampbell Commission \u2013 1866 \u2013 Sir John Lawrence\nThe Orissa famine, so named because it was most severe in Orissa, occurred in 1865\u20131866, and it affected Orissa, Bengal, Bihar, and Madras. It claimed over 20 lakh lives, with Orissa alone losing 10 lahks.\nDespite being warned, government officials did nothing to prepare for the disaster.\nThe government provided table-booked men with employment while leaving the work of charitable relief to the volunteer agency, adhering to the principles of free trade and the law of demand and supply.\nHowever, the famine proved to be a watershed moment in the history of famines in India since it was followed by the appointment of a commission led by Sir George Campbell.\nThis Commission was established by the British government to look into the reasons behind the famine in Odisha and make recommendations on how to avoid it from happening again.\nIt proposed emergency measures while blaming the government apparatus for the disaster.\nStretchy Commission \u2013 1880 \u2013 Lord Lytton\nSir Richard Strachey served as its chairman when it was established in 1878.\nIn the case of famine, the commission suggested government intervention in the food trade. In 1896\u20131897, there was a significant famine in India.\nAs a result of the Campbell Commission report\u2019s lack of seriousness, the British Government established this commission.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nThere should be a Famine Code created.\nIrrigation facilities should be built.\nDuring famines, land revenue collection should be stopped promptly, and land revenue should be remitted.\nInformation about the state of Indian agriculture and the peasantry should be gathered.\nSetting up a famine fund is necessary.\nLyall Commission \u2013 1886 \u2013 Lord d Elgin-II\nIt was established in 1897 with Sir James Lyall as its chairman. This commission suggested building irrigation infrastructure.\nMacDonnell Commission \u2013 1900 \u2013 Lord Curzon\nIt was established in 1900, with Sir Anthony (Later Lord) McDonnel as its chairman, to review and suggest revisions to the previous commission\u2019s report in light of the results of the most recent famine.\nThis Commission advised that to effectively handle the shortage of food grains, the official apparatus dealing with a famine should operate throughout the year.\nImportant Currency commissions and committees during British rule in India\n\nThe list below includes committees and commissions that the British established for currency reforms throughout the colonial era.\n\nMansfield Commission \u2013 1886 \u2013 Dufferin\nThe British-run Government of India established the Indian Currency Committee, often known as the Fowler Committee, on April 29, 1898, to investigate the country\u2019s existing state.\nSilver served as the primary base metal for Indian coins and money up until 1892. The Indian government declared its intention to \u201cshut Indian mints to silver\u201d in 1892, and in 1893 it put this policy into effect.\nOther Important\u00a0 commissions and committees during British rule in India on Currency:\nFowler Commission\u00a0by\u00a0Elgin\u00a0II in 1898\nBabington Smith Commission\u00a0by\u00a0Chelmsford\u00a0in 1919\nHilton Young Commission\u00a0by\u00a0Linlithgow\u00a0in 1926\nImportant Law commissions and committees during British rule in India\nLaw Commissions in India have a pre-independence origin. The first Law Commission was formed in 1834 as a result of the Charter Act, of 1833 under the chairmanship of TB Macaulay.\nThe first commission\u2019s recommendations resulted in the\u00a0codification of the penal code and the Criminal Procedure Code.\nThree other law commissions were constituted before independence by the British government.\nAll four pre-independent law commissions have contributed to the statute books immensely.\nAfter independence, the first Law Commission was constituted in 1955 in a continuance of the tradition of bringing law reforms in the country through the medium of law commissions.\nSecond Pre-Independence Law Commission,1853 \u2013\u00a0Sir John Romilly.\nThird Pre-Independence Law Commission, 1862-\u00a0Sir John Romilly.\nFourth Pre-Independence Law Commission, 1879 \u2013\u00a0Dr Whitley Stokes.\nOther Important Commissions and committees during British rule in India\nCommittees/Commission\n\t\nYear\n\t\nGovernor General/Viceroy\n\t\nSubjects of the committees/\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCommissions\n\n\n\nScott-Moncrieff Commission\n\t\n1901\n\t\nLord Curzon\n\t\nIrrigation\n\n\nFraser Commission\n\t\n1902\n\t\nLord Curzon\n\t\nPolice Reforms\n\n\nHunter Committee Report\n\t\n1919\n\t\nLord Chelmsford\n\t\nPunjab Disturbances\n\n\nMuddiman Committee\n\t\n1924\n\t\nLord Reading\n\t\nTo examine the working of Diarchy of the Montague-Chelmsford reforms\n\n\nButler Commission\n\t\n1927\n\t\nLord Irwin\n\t\nIndian State\u2019s relation with the British Crown\n\n\nWhitley Commission\n\t\n1929\n\t\nLord Irwin\n\t\nLabour\n\n\nSimon Commission\n\t\n1928\n\t\nLord Irwin\n\t\nTo investigate the progress of the governance scheme and suggest new steps for reforms.\n\n\nSapru Commission\n\t\n1935\n\t\nLord Linlithgow\n\t\nUnemployment\n\n\nChatfield Commission\n\t\n1939\n\t\nLord Linlithgow\n\t\nArmy\n\n\nFIoud Commission\n\t\n1940\n\t\nLord Linlithgow\n\t\nTenancy in Bengal\nConclusion\n\nThe Princely States created the Indian Public School Education in 1822 to manage India\u2019s education, which had been dominated by Orientalists who supported Oriental study over Anglicans. To advance Western education, they put a lot of pressure on the British India Company.\n\nThe Lord Macaulay Education Policy of 1835 aimed to create a university committee that would only teach the upper class in English. Before the entrance of the British, Hindus and Muslims received their education at Pathsala and Madrassa, but the Missionaries emerged as a new educational institution as a result of the British.\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

        "[CONTENT]": "Indian Railways is the fourth largest national railway system in the world by size and total route length. The history of Indian railways is more than 150 years old. Read here to learn about the history, present, and future of the Indian Railways.\n\nThe Indian government owns and operates Indian Railways. A monopoly on the nation\u2019s rail transportation was held by Indian Railways until relatively recently.\n\nAround 750 million tonnes of freight are transported on one of the world\u2019s busiest and biggest rail networks each year, carrying little over six billion people.\n\nIndian Railways employs more than 1.6 million people worldwide, making it the largest commercial or utility employer.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of Indian Railways\nRailway Infrastructure\nConclusion\nHistory of Indian Railways\n\n1832-1837: In Madras, India\u2019s initial railway ideas were made in 1832. Between 1836 and 1837, Arthur Cotton\u2019s Red Hill Railway, which was designed to transport granite for road construction, went from Red Hills to Madras\u2019s Chintadripet Bridge.\n\nThe first railway on the Indian sub-continent ran throughout 21 miles from Bombay to Thane.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n1843: The idea of a railway to connect Bombay with Thane, Kalyan, and with the Thal and Bhore Ghats inclines first occurred to Mr. George Clark, the Chief Engineer of the Bombay Government, during a visit to Bhandup in 1843.\n\n1853: The formal inauguration ceremony was performed on 16th April 1853, when 14 railway carriages carrying about 400 guests left Bori Bunder at 3.30 pm \u201camidst the loud applause of a vast multitude and to the salute of 21 guns.\u201d\n\n1854: The first passenger train steamed out of Howrah station destined for Hooghly, a distance of 24 miles, on 15th August 1854.\n\nThus, the first section of the East Indian Railway was opened to public traffic, inaugurating the beginning of railway transport on the Eastern side of the sub-continent.\n\n1856: In the south, the first line was opened on 1st July 1856 by the Madras Railway Company. It ran between Vyasarpadi Jeeva Nilayam (Veyasarpandy) and Walajah Road (Arcot), a distance of 63 miles.\n\n1859: In the North, a length of 119 miles of line was laid from Allahabad to Kanpur on 3rd March 1859.\n\n1862: The first Railway Workshop was established at Jamalpur, near Munger, Bihar, in 1862. It gradually became one of the major industrial units of India, with iron and steel foundries, rolling mills, and more.\n\n1864: The north got its first station \u2013 the Delhi Junction. The oldest one of the cities, it was a major station and junction and remains so to date.\n\nIt was first established near Chandni Chowk in 1864 when trains from Howrah/Calcutta started operating up to Delhi. The current building was made operational in 1903.\n\n1875: The first section from Hathras Road to Mathura Cantonment was opened to traffic on 19th October 1875.\n\nThese were the small beginnings that in due course developed into a network of railway lines all over the country.\n\nBy 1880 the Indian Railway system had a route mileage of about 9000 miles.\n\n1880: The Darjeeling Steam Tramway (later the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway) started its first section between Siliguri and Kurseong. The line was extended to Darjeeling in 1881.\n\nThis Line operated on Narrow Gauge and was accorded World Heritage Status in 1999, the first Railway in Asia to get such a standing.\n\n1895: After four decades of importing ready-made British locomotive parts for assembly, in 1895 the first steam locomotive was manufactured completely in India at the Ajmer Workshop.\n\n1899: The Nilgiri Mountain Railway is among the first, and still outstanding, examples of a Hill Passenger Railway. Opened in 1899, it was extended up to Ooty in 1903. It was a bold and ingenious engineering initiative to establish a rail link across a mountainous terrain of great beauty.\n\nThe \u201cengineering marvel\u201d still stands a testimony to the skills of Railway Engineering. It was accorded World Heritage Status in 2005.\n\n1903: The Kalka Shimla Narrow Gauge Railway opened for traffic in November 1903. This line was accorded World Heritage status in 2008.\n\nIndian Railways, the premier transport organization of the country is the largest rail network in Asia and the world\u2019s second-largest under one management.\n\n1914-20: The railroads were employed to suit British demands outside of India as the First World War broke out. The railways had seen great losses and were in disrepair after World War One. In 1920, the government assumed control of the Railways and severed the connection between their funding and other state resources, a practice that is still in place today with a distinct railway budget.\n\n1945-47: Trains were redirected to the Middle East during the Second World War, and railway workshops were turned into weapons factories, severely crippling the railroads. A sizable chunk of the railways was allocated to the then-recently created Pakistan at the time of independence in 1947.\n\nA total of 42 different railway networks, including 32 lines held by the former Indian princely states, were combined to establish the Indian Railways, a unified organization.\n\n1951: The organization of Indian railways into regional zones began in 1951, when the Southern (14 April 1951), Central (5 November 1951), and Western (5 November 1951) zones were created.\n\nNational Rail Museum, the first rail museum in India, was established in 1977 at Chanakyapuri, New Delhi. The Indian Railways now have 33 Museums, Heritage Parks and Galleries spread all across the country.\n\nThe railways became popular at an unprecedented speed. The frequency and the number of trains were increasing as more and more people became dependent on its services.\n\nAt the same time, there was a need to enhance the safety of the passengers and the number of trains on the track increased. Many instruments were thus developed for better management of railway sections.\n\nRailway Infrastructure\n\nPamban Bridge is the railway bridge that connects Rameswaram on Pamban Island to mainland India.\n\nOpened on 24 February 1914, it was India\u2019s first sea bridge.\nThe rail bridge is, for the most part, a conventional bridge resting on concrete piers, but has a double-leaf bascule section midway, which can be raised to let ships and barges pass through.\n\nOne of the latest challenges undertaken by the Indian Railways is the building of the steel arch bridge over the Chenab in Jammu.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe history of Indian Railways spans over 160 years since its existence, the Railways in India have grown and expanded by leaps and bounds, yet there are still unchartered territories to cover. Slowly but steadily the railways are connecting every part of India, which with the constant innovations in technology is much easier to do today than it was before.\n\nThough the newer generation is more used to air travel and automobiles, the railways must continue to grow; because even with all the other options available, the experience of an Indian train ride will remain unparalleled and continue to enthrall people for generations to come.\n\nToday, Indian Railways manages the fourth-largest rail network in the world, with tracks spanning more than 120,000km of the country.\n\nThe railway is preparing for the future with several initiatives. Free WiFi services were envisaged to be provided at more than 7,000 stations by 2019, and Railways has invested in greener technologies in a bid to meet 25% of its power demand with renewables, primarily solar, by 2025.\n\nRelated article:\u00a0\n\nSocio-economic effects of Railways worldwide\nRailway Safety in India\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

The Mughal Empire\u2019s final kingdom to be absorbed was this one.\nWhen the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb detained and imprisoned Abul Hasan for the remainder of his life in Daulatabad, merging Golconda into the Mughal empire, the dynasty came to an end in 1687 under the reign of its seventh sultan, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah.\nThe kingdom included portions of what are now the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Odisha.\nThe Adil Shahis and Nizam Shahis were in constant battle with the Golconda sultanate.\nHyderabad was the seat of government for the Qutb Shahis, the Asaf Jahi Nizams, and is currently the state capital of Telangana.\n\nAlso read: Indo-Islamic Architecture (Indian Culture Series \u2013 NCERT)\n\nMonuments Of The Qutb Shahi Architecture\n\nDifferent architectural typologies are represented by the monuments from the Qutb Shahi era. The Qutb shahi architecture is represented by the Hyderabad landmarks Golconda Fort, Qutb Shahi Tombs, and Charminar (1518 A.D. to 1687 A.D.).\n\nGolconda Fort of Qutb Shahi Architecture:\nThe Qutb Shahi dynasty\u2019s early capital of Golconda is a walled castle. It is situated in Hyderabad\u2019s western region.\nIt was established on a hilltop around the year 1143 and was first known as Mankal. Under the rule of Rajah of Warangal, it was initially a mud fort.\nThe Qutub Shahi dynasty and the Bahmani Sultans later reinforced it between the 14th and 17th centuries.\nThe main residence of the Qutub Shahi kings was Golconda.\nThe Golconda Fort encloses a mediaeval Islamic village within its seven-kilometre-long stone defences.\nThe historical Qutb shahi architecture includes funerary baths, silos, mosques, gardens, residential sections, pavilions, and royal courts in addition to military and defensive fortifications. This diversity of buildings illustrates how a mediaeval fortified town in India functioned.\nA palace and mosque remain, as well as a hilltop pavilion that stands around 130 metres high and provides a birds-eye perspective of other structures, which can be found in the inner fort.\nAt one time, the fort was home to priceless jewels including the Hope, Nassak, and Koh-i-Noor diamonds, which are among India\u2019s most valuable stones.\nQutb Shahi Tombs\nThe Qutb Shahi Tombs are two kilometres from the Golconda Fort and feature Persian, Hindu, and Pathani architectural influences.\nMany rulers who ruled the state in the 18th century were involved in the planning and construction of the tombs.\nThe tombs themselves are devoted to the seven Qutub Shahi rulers who ruled Golconda for 170 years, and their magnificence is nestled inside the lovely and picturesque environment and gardens of Ibrahim Bagh.\nMohammed Quli Qutub Shah, the man who founded Hyderabad, has one of the most spectacular tombs, which is 42 metres tall.\nThe Qutb Shahi Tombs are a mausoleum complex, a royal necropolis (cemetery), mortuary baths, and mosques in addition to the tombs of the Royal family and the servants who faithfully served them.\nThe complex includes a funeral bath, 30 tombs, and mosques. The Qutb Shahi tombs are the largest and most epigraphically documented dynasty necropolis in all of India, and they jointly represent an outstanding example of an Indo-Muslim dynastic necropolis, showing the elegance of Qutb shahi architecture.\nThe tombs are beautiful constructions with elaborate stone carvings. The tombs have a unique design that combines Persian, Pathan, and Hindu features.\nThese tombs were built out of grey granite that had stucco (a sturdy outside wall finish) ornamentation on them.\nThe graves are arranged in a big groups and are elevated. They have pointed arches surrounding domed constructions with square bases.\nA broad quadrangular terrace with steps leading up to it surrounds each tomb, which is situated there. The larger tombs have two stories in their galleries, but the smaller ones have a single story.\nCharminar\nThe Charminar was built in 1591 after Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, moved his headquarters from Golkonda to Hyderabad.\nThe Charminar was constructed in 1591 CE to commemorate the beginning of the second Islamic millennium year, according to Jean de Th\u00e9venot, a French traveller of the 17th century whose narrative was supported by easily accessible Persian literature.\nThe episode was highly regarded throughout the Islamic world, therefore Qutb Shah founded the city of Hyderabad to honour it by erecting this monument.\nAt the intersection of an ancient trade route that links the city to markets abroad via the port city of Machilipatnam, the Charminar was constructed.\nThe Charminar was constructed to serve as the hub of Hyderabad\u2019s Old City.\nIts structure has Persian architectural traits and an Indo-Islamic aesthetic. A sample was said to have been prepared at the Dabirpura/Nagabola graveyard before the Charminar was ever built.\nIts construction date, which coincides with the start of the second Islamic millennium, an occasion that was widely observed in the Islamic world, suggests that Hyderabad was planned to be a \u201cMillennial\u201d metropolis.\nDue to its design, it is frequently referred to as the Arc de Triomphe of the East. It was the zenith of Qutb shahi architecture.\nIt was the first monument ever built utilising a lime mortar and granite, and it wasn\u2019t until it was finished that architects all over the world realised how effective lime mortar was for building massive monuments.\nWith its four entrances facing the cardinal directions, it serves as the city\u2019s symbolic fulcrum and is located at the intersection of two major axes in Hyderabad\u2019s old city.\nThe planning grid that dictated Hyderabad\u2019s layout has a starting point and reference point in Charminar.\nIt is now officially recognised as the Telangana Emblem for the state of Telangana.\nIndo-Islamic Architectural Features of Charminar\nThe Charminar Masjid is a square structure with sides that are 20 metres (66 feet) long.\nOne of four spectacular arches, one on each of the four sides, faces a central point and opens straight into the street in front.\nAt each corner is a beautifully sculpted, 56-meter-tall (approximately 184-foot) minaret with a double balcony.\nEach minaret\u2019s bulbous dome is crowned with little, petal-like embellishments at the base.\nUnlike the Taj Mahal\u2019s minarets, the Charminar\u2019s four fluted minarets are a part of the main structure.\n149 spiral staircases lead up to the upper story. Equally noteworthy are the positioning of balconies and balustrades as well as the stucco embellishments on the building.\nThe monument was constructed using about 14,000 tonnes of granite, limestone, mortar, and marble showing the elegance of Qutb shahi architecture.\nThe fort\u2019s four huge arches, each of which faced one of the busiest royal ancestral roads, provided panoramic views of Hyderabad\u2019s bustling city when it first stood.\nA mosque is located at the westernmost point of the open roof. The last intact portion of the roof served as a royal court throughout the Qutb Shahi era. The fourth floor of the four-story building houses the actual mosque.\nThe four cardinal directions clocks were installed in 1889. Amid the Charminar mosque, there is a vazu (water cistern) with a small fountain for ablution before prayer.\nAlong with the Golconda Fort and the Qutb Shahi Tombs in Hyderabad, Charminar was included in the \u201ctentative list\u201d of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nThe monument was proposed on September 10, 2010, by India\u2019s Permanent Delegation to UNESCO.\nConclusion\n\nThe heart of the city beats to the beat of the Charminar, a priceless gem of Hyderabad and a source of national pride for India. It was a gift from the Qutb Shahi Dynasty to honour the splendour of the Sultanate.\n\nThe oldest mosque ever constructed in the \u201cCity of Nizams\u201d is located inside this enormous example of Indo-Islamic architecture called a Charminar, which translates to \u201cfour minarets\u201d and gives the history of the monument. The heritage nature of the two places must be preserved through collaboration between residents and governmental organisations.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nArticle written by Aseem Muhammed"

Lala Hardayal, Ramchandra, Bhagwan Singh, Kartar Singh Saraba, Barkatullah, and Bhai Parmanand were the driving forces behind the Ghadr Party. The Gadites wanted to incite a rebellion in India.\n\nAlso read: UPSC Prelims 2022 Question Topics: What are the 100 Areas from which UPSC Framed Questions last year?\n\nBackground of the Ghadar Party\nAt the start of the 20th century, the growing Indian Independence Movement triggered a rise in nationalist feelings not just on the Indian subcontinent but also among students and emigrants from the same area all over the world.\nNationalist ideologies were instilled in these students by revolutionary thinkers like Taraknath Das and Lala Har Dayal to mobilise them.\nTo conduct revolutionary operations, activists had already constructed the \u201cSwadesh Sevak Home\u201d in Vancouver and the \u201cUnited India House\u201d in Seattle. The Ghadr party was formally established in 1913.\nLala Har Dayal, Sant Baba Wasakha Singh Dadehar, Baba Jawala Singh, Santokh Singh, and Sohan created the Ghadar Party, formerly known as the Pacific Coast Hindustan Association, on July 15, 1913, in the United States.\nAmong the Indian diaspora in the United States, Canada, East Africa, and Asia, the Ghadar party attracted a substantial following.\nFeatures of the Ghadar Party\n\nThe Ghadar Party was a predominantly Indian-founded revolutionary group. The party included Sikh, Hindu, and Muslim members, although Sikh leaders predominated. The party was multiethnic but primarily Punjabi. The Ghadar party, which had its headquarters in San Francisco and its origins in the rural Californian Punjabi immigrant community, was also dedicated to bringing about the independence of India by revolution.\n\nRevolution\nThe Ghadar programme sought to coordinate official assassinations, produce anti-imperialist and revolutionary literature, collaborate with Indian troops stationed abroad, acquire weapons, and incite a simultaneous uprising in all British colonies.\nA working committee was established, and it was decided to launch, \u201cThe Ghadar\u201d, a free weekly newspaper, and to build Yugantar Ashram as the organization\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco.\nThe militants in the Ghadar party immediately began an active propaganda campaign, visiting the farms and mills where the majority of the Punjabi immigrant labourers were employed.\nThe inaugural issue of Ghadar was released on November 1st in Urdu and in December in Gurmukhirumukhi. The paper\u2019s heading made it clear what it was about An enemy of British rule, or Angrezi Raj ka Dushman. Each issue\u2019s front page featured Angrezi Raj Ka Chittha, or \u201cAn Expose of British Rule.\nThey featured the eradication of Indian crafts and industries, the recurrence of famines and epidemics that claimed the lives of millions of Indians, and the usage of the Indian slave practice of giving money collected from Hindus and Muslims to Christian missionaries, as well as the attempt to sow discord between Hindus and Muslims: in short, the entire critique of British rule put forth by the Indian national movement was summarised and presented to Ghadar readers each week.\nThe Indian War of Independence \u2013 1857, written by Savarkar, was serialised to further the message.\nThe Ghadar also highlighted the heroic acts of the Anushilan Samiti, the Yugantar group, and Russian secret societies, as well as contributions from Lokamanya Tilak, Sri Aurobindo, V.D. Savarkar, Madame Cama, Shyamji Krishna Varma, Ajit Singh, and Sufi Amba Prasad.\nThe poetries out for their secular tone as much as their revolt was fervour was published in The Ghadar and afterwards compiled, published, and distributed for free under the title Ghadar di Goonj may have had the most influence.\nThe Ghadar reached populations in the Philippines, and Hong Kong, China, the Malay States, and was widely disseminated among Indians in North America.\nIt sparked a ferocious debate and discussion and received an unparalleled response. The poems it included were chanted during meetings of Punjabi immigrants and swiftly spread throughout the world.\nIn a\u00a0 short period, the Ghad\u00e1r was able to change the Punjabi immigrant\u2019s self-image from that of a devoted soldier of the British Raj to that of a rebel whose main objective was to overthrow the British control of his motherland. The Ghadar purposefully called the Punjabi\u2019s history as a loyalist to his attention, made him regret it, and tasked him with making amends in the spirit of his ancestors\u2019 earlier tradition of resistance to oppression.\nSome Ghadar Party members travelled to Punjab in 1914 after the Fitoroke out to spark an armed uprising for India\u2019s independence.\nAlong with smuggling firearms, the Ghadar party were successful in stirring up a rebellion among Indian soldiers serving in the British Army.\nThe British brutally put down the next revolt, which is now known as the Ghadar Mutiny, and killed 42 mutineers after the Lahore Conspiracy Case trial.\nNevertheless, from 1914 to 1917, the Ghadar Party opposed colonialism with the aid of Central Powers Imperial Germany and the Ottoman Empire both of which were Central Powers opposed to the British.\nThe Ghadar stated that they \u201cwanted brave soldiers to ignite rebellion in India.\u201d\nFollowing the Komagata Maru Incident in 1914, which directly challenged Canadian anti-Indian immigration rules, hundreds of Indians living in the US sold their companies and houses to force the British out of India, strengthening the Ghadar Party\u2019s numbers.\n\nAlso read: India\u2019s Struggle for Independence: Indian Freedom Movement\n\nKomagata Maru Incident\nThe ship Komagata Maru started on its terrible voyage to Canada in March 1914. Canada had long imposed strong limits on Indian immigration, passing legislation that restricted entry to only individuals who made a continuous journey from India. This strategy worked since no maritime lines provided a route along that line.\nHowever, in November 1913, the Canadian Supreme Court permitted 35 Indians who had not travelled continuously admission. Gurdit Singh, an Indian contractor based in Singapore, was inspired by this choice decision to charter a ship to carry Indians to Vancouver falls throughout East and Southeast Asia.\nWith 376 Indian passengers in total, the ship sailed for Vancouver. Ghadar activists held talks and distributed literature on the ship in Yokohama, Japan. The Punjabi press issued grave warnings if the Indians were denied access to Canada.\nIn contrast, the Canadian press adopted a different position, and some Vancouver newspapers published alerts about the \u201cMounting Oriental Invasion.\u201d The Canadian government, meantime, had filled the legal gaps that had prompted the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in November. The lines of battle were marked in the sand.\nWhen the ship arrived in Vancouver, it was barred from entering the port and surrounded by police. Under the direction of Husain Rahim, Sohan Lal Pathak, and Balwant Singh, a \u201cShore Committee\u201d was established to defend the rights of the passengers. Meetings for protest were arranged, and money was raised.\nA British-backed uprising in India was on the verge of happening. Under the direction of Bhagwan Singh, Barkatullah, Ram Chandra, and Sohan Singh Bhakna, a potent campaign was organised throughout the United States, and the populace was counselled to gean t ready for an uprising.\nSoon later, the Komagata Maru was compelled to depart the Canadian seas. The British government ordered that no passenger be permitted to disembark anywhere along the journey, not even at the ports where they had boarded the ship, but only at Calcutta, Before World War I broke out, the ship arrived at Yokohama.\nThe ship became a focal point for anti-British mobilisation and unleashed a wave of anger and outrage among the Indian community in every port it stopped at. When the ship touched down in Budge, close to Calcutta, the anxious and incensed passengers, irritated by the hostile attitude of the government, fought the police, leading to a fight in which 18 passengers were killed and 202 were arrested. Some of them managed to escape.\nLeading members of the Ghadar Movement gathered for a special conference where they determined that the chance must be taken, that it is better to die than do nothing at all, and that their primary weakness\u2014a shortage of weapons\u2014can be solved by travelling to India and gaining the support of Indian soldiers.\nThe Ailan-e-Jung, or Proclamation of War, was published by the Ghadar Party and widely disseminated. Ram Chandra, Bhagwan Singh, and Mohammed Barkatullah organise several at several public gatherings to entice Indians to organise an armed uprising in their native country. Indians were despatched to Singapore, Burma, China, Hong Kong, the Malay States, Japan, the Philippines, and Singapore to convince people to come home and join the rebels. The more furious Ghadar supporters immediately departed for India, including Raghubar Dayal Gupta and Kartar Singh Sarabha, who was later killed by the British in a conspiracy case.\nImportance of Komagatha Maru incident\nDue to the prejudice and violation of human rights, the Komagata Maru incident garnered attention and outrage on a global scale.\nThis was one of many instances in the early 20th century where immigrants of Asian heritage were barred from entering Canada and the United States due to exclusion rules.\nThe incident provided the Ghadar party with more motivation to continue fighting against colonial control, which indirectly aided the Indian freedom movement.\nThe Ghadar Party extensively used the enflamed emotions following the tragedy to gain support for its objectives.\nThe incident also serves to remind Indians of the role played by individuals who fought for independence while living abroad.\n\nRelated Article: Popular Uprisings and Revolts against the British \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nReasons for failure of Ghadar Party\nBefore they even arrived in India, many Ghadar leaders were detained, and after they disembarked, they were imprisoned.\nKartar Singh Saraba, Pandit Kanshi Ram, and G. Pingale were among those who managed to avoid capture and gathered in Punjab to carry out the uprising. At the time, Punjab\u2019s Lieutenant-General was Michael O\u2019 Dwyer.\nGhadar Party leaders in Punjab employed a variety of tactics. Both the native Punjabi population and the British referred to them as dacoits, none of them welcomed them. The leaders of the Ghadar were directed to be apostates by some Punjabi Sikhs.\nAt the time, Sikhs were the most devoted soldiers in the British Army, and they had already garnered enough rewards from these positions.\nO\u2019Dwyer mandated the detention of all Ghadar party members, whether they were doing it lawfully or not.\nThe Ghadr party movement\u2019s achievement was in the realm of ideology. It preached militant nationalism while remaining completely secular.\nHowever, it failed to achieve much politically and militarily because it lacked organized and sustained leadership, and underestimated the extent of preparation required at every level\u2014organizational, ideological, financial, and tactical strategic.\n\nThe Ghadarites believed that India would be equally enthusiastic about revolution as it had been about their successful efforts to recruit Indians in the United States, but they soon realised that this was not the case. The Indian National Congress, the priests of several significant Sikh gurdwaras, and numerous other nationalist figures in India attacked the party. The interconnection of colonialism, racial subordination, and economic exploitation helped Ghadarites in North America mobilise thousands along the Pacific Coast, but they were unable to convince their Indian counterparts to join them.\n\nThe Ghadar Movement\u2019s legacy After the brutal British repression, the Ghadar Movement started to weaken. 1917 saw the Ghadar Party split into a Communist and a Socialist faction following the end of World War I. Despite this loss, the Ghadar Party served as an inspiration for many revolutionaries in the quest for liberation. Bhagat Singh is the most renowned among them. The Ghadar movement might be characterised as a story of extraordinary bravery, labour, and toil that touched the hearts of every Indian living in foreign lands.\n\nThe strong comments made by its leaders did influence the sentiment of foreigners against the British misrule in India. It qualifies as a significant conflict since it inspired the populace to fight for freedom and planted the seeds for all subsequent actions. This movement\u2019s legacy endures forever. The recent apologies from Canada to India over the event demonstrate how significant this movement is.\n\nPrevious year UPSC question (2022)\n\nConsider the following freedom fighters:\n\nBarindra Kumar Ghosh\nJogesh Chandra Chatterjee\nRash Behari Bose\n\nWho of the above was/were actively associated with the Ghadar Party?\n\n(a) 1 and 2\n\n(b) 2 only\n\n(c) 1 and 3\n\n(d) 3 only\n\nAnswer (d)\n\nArticle Written\u00a0 by Atheena Fathima Riyas"

From the upbeat bhangra of Punjab to Garba in Gujarat and Bhavageete in Karnataka, India\u2019s folk music history is truly fantastic.\n\nFolk music, which has developed to ease the suffering and break up the monotony of daily living, is intimately tied with farming and other related vocations.\n\nEven though pop and rap music helped folk music lose popularity, no traditional festival or celebration would be complete without folk music.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory\u00a0 of Folk Music in India\nFolk music of different states\nWanawan\nPanihari\nMaand\nSohar\nBaul\nKhongjom Parva\nPandavani\nLavani\nPowada\nMando\nKolattam/Kolannalu\nBhavageete\nBhatiali\nKummi Paatu\nOvi\nPai Song\nHistory\u00a0 of Folk Music in India\n\nThe Vedic literature, which goes back to 1500 BC, contains the first descriptions of Indian folk music. Some academics and industry professionals even contend that Indian folk music may be as old as the nation. For instance, it is said that Pandavani, a type of folk music that is common throughout Central India, is as old as the Hindu epic Mahabharata. This astounding assertion is supported by the fact that Pandavani\u2019s focus is on the exploits of Bhima, a significant figure from the Mahabharata.\n\nFolk songs were later widely utilised for entertainment and to commemorate important occasions like weddings, childbirth, festivals, etc. Folk music was also employed to transmit important information from one generation to the next. This implies that these songs might have had a significant impact before the introduction of paper to India.\n\nSince there was no solid material available for humans to use to preserve historical knowledge, it became crucial to pass down valuable knowledge through songs. Therefore, folk songs were highly regarded by indigenous people because they not only offered pleasure but also valuable lessons that could be applied to daily life.

Now, even great epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata are sung in this manner, along with the traditional Manipuri stories of Khamba and Thoibi and those about the exploits of Manipur\u2019great rulers.\n\nPandavani\n\nFolk music of Chhattisgarh.\u00a0 It is a folk singing style of musical narration of tales from the ancient epic Mahabharata with musical accompaniment and Bhima as head too.\u00a0 This folk music is popular in Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. While Tambura is largely used as an accompanying musical instrument, it is also used as a prop to explain different characters from the Mahabharata.\n\nFor instance, the performer often places the Tambura on their shoulder while narrating the bravery of Bhima. While doing so, the Tambura represents Bhima\u2019s mace. Other musical instruments used are Manjira, Harmonium, Dholak and Tabla.\n\nLavani\n\nFolk music of Maharashtra. Traditionally, the songs are sung by female artists, but male artists may occasionally sing Lavanis. The dance format associated with Lavani is known as Tamasha. \u00a0It was initially performed to entertain the soldiers. Lavani is further divided into two types \u2013 Nirguni Lavani and Shringari Lavani. While Nirguni Lavani is usually philosophical in nature, Shringari Lavani is sensual and often deals with erotic subject matter that often induces laughter among its listeners.\n\nThis musical form is also classified based on its listeners. If Lavani is performed in close quarters by a young girl for a set of dignitaries, it is called Baithakichi Lavani. If it is performed in public in front of a large audience, it is called Phadachi Lavani.\n\nPowada\n\nFolk music of Maharashtra. The word Powada itself means \u201cthe narration of a story in glorious terms\u201d.The narratives are always odes in praise of an individual hero or an incident or place.\n\nMando\n\nFolk music of Goa. Mando is a musical form that evolved during the 19th and 20th centuries among the Goan Catholics. The major theme of Mandos is love, the minor ones being historical narratives, grievance against exploitation and social injustice, and political resistance during the Portuguese presence in Goa.\n\nKolattam/Kolannalu\n\nIt is the folk music of Andhra Pradesh, also called \u2018stick dance\u2019 and one of the most popular dance narratives. It \u00a0is a rural art usually performed during village festivals.\n\nBhavageete\n\nIt is one of the most important folk music of Karnataka. It is a form of expressionist poetry and light music. They are songs close to Ghazals sung in slower pitch. Bhavageete lies in music of expression and hence, the singer\u2019s expressions constitute the most important aspect of this form of music. The subject matter of this musical form deals with nature, love, philosophy, etc. Though Bhavageete is an ancient musical form, contemporary musicians and singers have revived it by incorporating poems written by eminent Kannada writers and poets.\n\nBhatiali\n\nBhatiali was sung by the fishermen of ancient Bengal. It is said that this musical form was used by the oarsmen and fishermen of Bengal to keep themselves entertained when they didn\u2019t have to row their boats with all their might. Nirmalendu Chowdhury is one of the best exponents of this ancient musical form.\n\nKummi Paatu\n\nKummi Paatu is yet another folk music form from Tamil Nadu. These folk songs are usually accompanied by a folk dance form known as Kummi or Kummi Aattam. It is often performed throughout Tamil Nadu during festivals and rituals.\n\nOvi\n\nThis type of music is native to Maharashtra and Goa. They are usually women\u2019s songs, which are sung by women in their spare time and while doing their household chores. They usually have four small lines of poetry in them. These are typically songs written for weddings, pregnancy, and as children\u2019s lullabies.\n\nPai Song\n\nThe majority of these songs are from Madhya Pradesh. They are sung at festivals, especially those that take place during the rainy season. As these are farmer communities\u2019 songs, they generally beg for a \u2018good monsoon and a good harvest.\u2019The Saira dance is typically performed in Pai music.\n\nIndia is a geographically diverse country, and this diversity is reflected in its culture. Dance and folk songs have always been an integral part of Indian society. Folk music is based on various social, and religious engagements in the community. These folk songs also enlighten us in getting knowledge about the culture of primitive societies and cultures.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nFolk Paintings\nClassical dances of India\nIndian musical instruments\nClassical music\nFolk music of India\n\nArticle Written By Atheena\u00a0 Fathima Riyas"

Read further to know more.\n\nDifferent tribal groups spread across the country may share common issues but the distinctions between them are equally significant.\n\nSeveral tribal movements, including the Santhals, Hos, Oraons, Mundas in Chota Nagpur, and the Santhal Parganas, have been largely concentrated in the so-called \u201ctribal belt\u201d of middle India.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss each of these movements briefly.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDifferent Causes for Mainland and North-Eastern Tribal Revolts\nTribal Lands or Forests\nCurb on Shifting Cultivation\nExploitation\nAdvent of Christianity\nImportant Tribal Movements in India\nPahariyas\u2019 Rebellion\nChuar Uprising\nKol Mutiny (1831)\nHo and Munda Uprisings (1820-1837)\nThe Santhal Rebellion (1855-56)\nKhond Uprisings (1837-1856)\nKoya Revolts\nBhil Revolts\nKoli Risings\nRamosi Risings\nKhasi Uprising\nHow Did Colonial Rule Affected Tribal Lives?\nDifferent Causes for Mainland and North-Eastern Tribal Revolts\n\nThe tribal movements in India were sparked off by a number of factors, a few important of which are:\n\nTribal Lands or Forests\n\nOne of the main reason that concerned tribal people were the tribal lands or forests.\n\nThe land settlements of the British affected the tradition among the tribals and disrupted their social fabric. The tribals lost their land, and there was an influx of non-tribals to these areas.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nCurb on Shifting Cultivation\n\nShifting cultivation in forests was curbed which created problems for tribal people. By creating reserved forests and limiting grazing and the use of timber, the government expanded its authority over the forest regions. This was driven\u00a0by the company\u2019s increasing demands for timber for use in railroads and shipping.\n\nExploitation\n\nThe hardship of the tribal people was made worse by its exploitation by the police, traders, and moneylenders, most of whom were outsiders. As the tribal people had their own customs and traditions, some general laws were also abhorred for their intrusive nature.\n\nAdvent of Christianity\n\nAs colonialism expanded, Christian missionaries entered these areas and interfered with the tribal peoples\u2019 traditional ways of life. The indigenous people disliked the missionaries because they saw them as representatives of the foreign rule.\n\nImportant Tribal Movements in India\n\nSome important tribal movements are discussed below.\n\nPahariyas\u2019 Rebellion\n\nThe British expansion on their territory led to an uprising by the martial Pahariyas of the Raj Mahal Hills in 1778. The British were forced to usher in peace by declaring their territory as damni-kot area.\n\nChuar Uprising\n\nThe Chuar indigenous tribesmen of the Jungle Mahal in the Midnapore district and also of the Bankura district (in Bengal) were forced to take up weapons amid famine, intensive land revenue demands, and economic distress.\n\nThe majority of these tribes\u2019 inhabitants were farmers and hunters. The rebellion took place from 1766 to 1772, and between 1795 and 1816 it resurfaced. The Chuars were prominent in Manbhum and Barabhum, especially in the hills between Barabhum and Ghatsila.\n\nDurjan (or Durjol) Singh led the most important revolt in 1798. Due to the implementation of the Bengal Regulations, Durjan Singh lost his position as the zamindar of Raipur. The British mercilessly put down the uprising. Madhab Singh, the raja of Barabhum\u2019s brother, Raja Mohan Singh, the zamindar of Juriah, and Lachman Singh of Dulma were additional leaders among the Chuars.\n\nKol Mutiny (1831)\n\nThe Kols are inhabitants of Chhotanagpur, along with other tribes. This covered Ranchi, Singhbhum, Hazaribagh, Palamau, and the western parts of Manbhum. The trouble in 1831 started with large-scale land transfers from Kol headmen to outsiders, such as oppressive Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim farmers and moneylenders, who demanded high taxes.\n\nThe Kols resented this and in 1831, under the leadership of Buddho Bhagat.\n\nHo and Munda Uprisings (1820-1837)\n\nThe Parahat organized his Ho tribals to revolt against the occupation of Singhbhum (now in Jharkhand). The revolt continued till 1827 when the Ho tribals were forced to submit.\n\nIn 1899-1900, the Mundas in the region south of Ranchi rose under Birsa Munda. The Ulgulan was one of the most significant tribal uprisings in the period 1860-1920. The uprising, which got its start as a religious movement, gathered political power to fight against the introduction of zamindari tenures, which are feudal in nature, as well as against moneylenders\u2019 and forest contractors\u2019 exploitation.\n\nThe Santhal Rebellion (1855-56)\n\nThe Santhal rebellion against the zamindars was brought on by the ongoing oppression of the agricultural Santhals, a people who had escaped and settled in the plains of the Rajmahal hills (Bihar). The Santhats proclaimed the end of Company authority and established the region between Bhagalpur and Rajmahal as an autonomous region under the leadership of two brothers named Sidhu and Kanhu. By 1856, the uprising had been put down.\n\nKhond Uprisings (1837-1856)\n\nThe Khonds of the mountainous regions spanning from Odisha to the Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam districts of Andhra Pradesh rose up in rebellion against Company authority between 1837 and 1856.\n\nKoya Revolts\n\nThe Koyas of the eastern Godavari track (modern Andhra), joined by Khonda Sara chiefs and rebelled multiple times between 1803 to 1862. They rose once again in 1879-80 under Tomma Sora.\n\nTheir complaints included new regulations, denial of their traditional rights over forest areas, and oppression by the police and moneylenders. In 1886, Raja Anantayyar organized another uprising in response to Tomma Sora\u2019s demise.\n\nBhil Revolts\n\nThe mountain routes connecting the north and the Deccan were under the control of the Bhils, who lived in the Western Ghats. In 1817\u20131819, they rose up in revolt against Company rule due to famine, poverty, and misgovernment.\n\nKoli Risings\n\nThe Kolis residing in the neighborhood of Bhils rose up in rebellion against the Company\u2019s rule in 1829, and 1839 and again during 1844-48. They objected to the Company\u2019s rule being imposed on them because it resulted in widespread unemployment for them and the destruction of their forts.\n\nRamosi Risings\n\nThe hill tribes of the Western Ghats known as the Ramosis had not accepted British rule and the British style of administration. They objected to the annexation policy. The Ramosis, who had worked for the Maratha government, lost their source of income with the British capture of the Maratha territory.\n\nIn 1822, they arose under Chittur Singh and plundered the region around Satara. Under Umaji Naik of Poona and his supporter Bapu Trimbakji Sawant, there were again eruptions in 1825\u20131826; the unrest continued till 1829.\n\nKhasi Uprising\n\nThe East India Company sought to construct a route connecting the Brahmaputra Valley with Sylhet after occupying the steep area between the Garo and Jaintia Hills. Many outsiders, including Englishmen, Bengalis, and laborers from the plains, were brought to these areas for this purpose.\n\nTirath Singh organized the Khasis, Garos, Khamptis, and Singphos to expel outsiders from the plains. Eventually, the uprising turned into a popular uprising against the British administration in the region. By 1833, the uprising had been put down by the superior English armed force.\n\nHow Did Colonial Rule Affected Tribal Lives?\n\nBefore the arrival of the British, the tribal chiefs were essential people. They had the authority to run and manage their lands, and they had considerable financial power. Under British rule, the functions and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. They were no longer able to perform their traditional duties and lost the power they had once held among their people.\n\nChanges in forest laws had a considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests\nwere state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted that denied their long-traditional control over the forest and forest products.\n\nMany tribal groups reacted against the colonial forest laws and disobeyed the new rules, continued with practices that were declared illegal, and at times rose in open rebellion. Such rebellions include Songram Sangma\u2019s uprising in Assam in 1906 and the Central Provinces\u2019 forest satyagraha in the 1930s. Thousand of lives were lost during these rebellions.\n\nThe plight of the tribals who had to go far away from their homes in search of work was even worse. From the late nineteenth century, tea plantations started coming up and mining became an important industry. For employment in Jharkhand\u2019s coal mines and Assam\u2019s tea plantations, large numbers of tribal people were hired. The working condition and wages there were not sustainable which made their lives more miserable.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

The treaty ended the state of war that had existed between Germany and the Allies from 1914 and brought World War I to an end.\n\nThe controversial War Guilt clause blamed Germany for World War I and imposed heavy debt payments on Germany. The treaty gets its name from the Palace of Versailles where it was signed.\nThe Treaty of Versailles was a major contributing factor in the outbreak of the\u00a0Second World War.\n\nEnding the First World War: the Paris Peace Conference and Signing of the Treaty of Versailles\nExactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand\u2014the event that tipped Europe into world war\u2014the Treaty of Versailles was signed in Paris on June 28, 1919.\nThe armistice signed on November 11, 1918 officially ended the hostilities, but the negotiations between the Allied victors at the Paris Peace Conference lasted six months and involved diplomatic delegations from over thirty-two countries.\nUS President Woodrow Wilson had delivered a speech in January 1918, in which he laid out his vision for the postwar world. The\u00a0Fourteen Points elaborated Wilson\u2019s plan for the comprehensive overhaul of international relations. He called for an immediate end to the war, the establishment of an international peacekeeping organization, international disarmament, open diplomacy, the explicit disavowal of war, and independence for formerly colonial territories.\nWilson\u2019s Fourteen Points were hugely influential in shaping the contours of the postwar world and in spreading the language of peace and democracy around the world.\nIn addition to negotiating the Treaty of Versailles, the Paris Peace Conference established the\u00a0League of Nations, an international peacekeeping organization tasked with resolving international disputes without resorting to military force.\nTerms of the Treaty of Versailles\nThe Treaty of Versailles established a blueprint for the postwar world. One of the most controversial terms of the treaty was the War Guilt clause, which explicitly and directly blamed Germany for the outbreak of hostilities.\nThe treaty forced Germany to disarm, to make territorial concessions, and to pay reparations to the Allied powers in the staggering amount of $5 billion.\nAlthough US President Woodrow Wilson was opposed to such harsh terms, he was outmaneuvered by French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau.\nFrance was the only Allied power to share a border with Germany, and therefore suffered the bulk of the devastation and casualties from the German war machine. The French aimed to weaken Germany to the greatest extent possible.\nThe peace negotiations were helmed by Woodrow Wilson of the United States, Lloyd George of Britain, Georges Clemenceau of France and Vittorio Orlando of Italy. They were collectively known as the \u201cBig Four\u201d, all through the role played by Italy was limited.\nGermany and other defeated parties of the Central Powers were not represented. Nor was Russia which had concluded a peace treaty in secret with Germany despite being a part of the Allied camp\nIn retrospect, the \u2018Big Four\u2019 were not on the same page regarding the peace treaty. Each had their own objectives which were in conflict with that of the other.\nThe French wanted to prevent any future attacks by Germany and for this, they sought to economically weaken it by paying heavy reparations.\nThe British wanted to rebuild Germany in order to gain a strong trading partner\nThe Italians wanted to expand their power and influence in post-war Europe so that they would be at an equal footing with that of other European powers\nThe Americans opposed any territorial changes and sought to implement a world order that was in line with the Fourteen Points. Other European leaders considered the Fourteen Points as too unrealistic to translate into policy\nUltimately the European Allies imposed a harsh treaty by forcing Germany to surrender all of its overseas colonies and 10 % of its land. Other aspects of the treaty are as follows:\nGermany would limit the size of its army and navy and was not allowed to maintain an air force.\nIt called for Kaiser Wilhelm II, ruler of Germany, to stand trial for war crimes\nAbove all, it included the \u201cwar guilt clause\u201d which held Germany solely responsible for starting the war and required it to pay reparations for Allied war losses.\nImpact of the Treaty of Versailles\nWorld War I had begun when a Serb nationalist, Gavrilo Princip, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in Sarajevo. Gavrilo was a member of the Black Hand, a Serb nationalistic group with the aim of uniting Serbs living outside the kingdom of Serbia. This had prompted the Austro-Hungarian Empire to declare war on Serbia and in return Serbia\u2019s allies declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire, thus sparking the war.\nThe German people were furious that this fact was ignored by the Allies and Germany was made the sole party responsible for all the horrors of World War I. The nation\u2019s burden of reparations crossed 132 billion gold Reichsmarks. It was a sum so huge that economists like John Maynard Keynes pointed out that Germany would not be able to pay it in full and even if, by chance that it did, the European economy would collapse.\nThe economic hardship and the resentment of the treaty within Germany were fertile grounds for ultra-nationalist sentiments, which were exploited by Hitler and his Nazi Party to seize power and laid the groundwork for World War II, a conflict far deadlier and devastating than World War I had ever been.\nConsequences of the Treaty of Versailles\nAlthough President Wilson was heavily involved in negotiating the treaty, which reflected his vision for the postwar world, isolationists in the US Congress proved a major stumbling block to ratification. The so-called \u201cIrreconcilables,\u201d mostly Republicans but also some Democrats, opposed the treaty, particularly Article X, which committed member-states of the League of Nations to go to war on each other\u2019s behalf in the event of an unprovoked act of aggression.\nThe Irreconcilables saw this as a violation of US sovereignty and some believed that it would commit the United States to an alliance system that could lead to another war. Due to the opposition of the Irreconcilables, the Treaty of Versailles was never ratified by Congress, and the United States never became a member of the League of Nations\nWhen Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1934, his government began to violate many of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Not only did Hitler announce a moratorium on all debt payments and cease making reparations, but he began to build up the German armed forces in earnest.\nSome historians believe that the onerous terms of the treaty laid the psychological and economic groundwork for the rise of the Nazi party, which capitalized on German resentment of the burdens imposed by the Allied powers after the First World War.\nRelated posts\nFirst World War (1914-1918): Causes and Consequences\nSecond World War (1939-1945): Causes and Consequences\n\nArticle written by Aseem muhammed\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)"

Religious crisis struck the young king when he slew a Brahmin. Tradition relates that he invested greatly in construction projects for the public to expiate his sins.\n\nAmong the temples that he built were the ancillary shrines and the walls of Jagannath temple which took fourteen years to achieve completion in 1198 CE.\nHe organized the order of the temple servitors (Chattisanijoga) to manage the Temple built by his father.\nThe murtis of Lord Jagannath and his siblings were revered and worshipped here without interruption until 1568.\n\nThe temple annals, the Madala Panji records that the Jagannath temple at Puri has been invaded and plundered eighteen times.\n\nIn 1568, after defeating the Gajapati ruler Mukunda Deva, General Kalapahad led the victorious army of the Nawab of Bengal, Sultan Suleiman Karani into the Temple complex to loot it. The deities were destroyed.\n\nIn 1575, the deities were restored in Puri by Ramachandra Deva I of the Kingdom of Khurda.\n\nAs an expression of their gratitude, the devotees bestowed Ramachandra Deva I with the name \u2018Abhinav Indrayumna\u2019 (Indrayumna incarnate).\nWithin two decades, Ramachandra Deva I\u2019s authority over Puri and the Temple was recognized even by the Mughal Empire.\nRaja Mansingh bestowed upon him the title of \u2018Gajapati Ruler of Khurda and Superintendent of the Jagannath Temple\u2019.\n\nIn 1692, Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb ordered to close off the temple until he wanted to reopen it. It was re-opened only after Aurangzeb died in 1707.\n\nThe Maratha and the British assumed control of the Temple complex in 1751 and 1803 respectively.\n\nLocally, however, the Rajas of Khurda would retain the trust of the devotees in managing the Temple and its rituals.\n\nIn 1809 the British East India Company officially returned the charge of the Temple to the Rajas who would retain control till British power itself was uprooted from the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIn 1975, the Archeological Survey of India undertook a project to remove the multiple layers of lime plaster to uncover the original designs beneath.

Read the article to know more about the administrative organization during the British rule.\n\nThe East India Company was founded in 1600, and after becoming a controlling body in 1765, it had little immediate influence on Indian politics and government.\n\nHowever, there were major constitutional and governmental changes during the Company administration from 1773 to 1858 and British Crown rule from 1858 to 1947.\n\nThese modifications were unwittingly made to India\u2019s political and administrative structure to advance British imperial ideology.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMajor changes introduced\nCreation of a police system\nCode of Cornwallis\nThe Police Commission of 1860\nDevelopment of Judiciary\nReforms to the Judiciary under Warren Hastings\nChanges made by Cornwallis\nAlterations made by William Bentinck\nDevelopment of Civil Services\n\u00a0Charter Act 1853\nIndian Civil Service Act 1861\nStatutory Civil Service\nAitchison Commission,1886\n\u00a0Montford Reform 1919\n\u00a0Lee Commission,1924\n\u00a0Government of India Act,1935\nA new system of land holding and Land Revenue\nPermanent Settlement\nRyotwari Settlement\n\u00a0Mahalwari Settlement\nConclusion\nMajor changes introduced\n\nThe Company first limited its efforts to oversight, leaving the management of its assets in India in the hands of Indians. However, it was soon seen that sticking to outdated administrative practices did not sufficiently suit British objectives. As a result, the Company handled every part of administration on its own.\n\nBengal\u2019s government was radically reorganised under Warren Hastings and Cornwallis, who established a new system based on the English organisational structure. The expansion of British influence into new territories and new issues, demands, experiences, and ideas led to changes in the administrative structure.

British manufacturers and merchants could not possibly hope to sell their products in every nook and cranny of India without law and order.\n\nBeing foreigners, the British had no chance of winning the hearts of the Indian populace; as a result, they depended on superior military rather than popular support to maintain their dominance over India.\n\nThe major changes introduced by the British are:\n\nCreation of a police system\n\nCornwallis was in charge of setting up India\u2019s modern police force. He built a daroga-led system of Thanas (or circles).\n\nCODE OF CORNWALLIS\nThe set of policies that made up British India\u2019s administrative structure, the Cornwallis, or Bengal, system, was given legal shape by Lord Cornwallis, governor-general of India.\nThe system spread throughout northern India after a set of regulations were published on May 1st, 1793, starting in Bengal.\nPrior to the Charter Act of 1833, these were the main pillars upon which British India\u2019s governance was based.\nTHE POLICE COMMISSION OF 1860\nIn accordance with the Police Commission\u2019s recommendations, the Indian Police Act of 1861 was passed (1860).\nThe commission promoted a civil police force with a superintendent in charge of each district, a deputy inspector-general in command of each range, and an inspector-general in control of each province.\nCrimes like dacoity and thugee were gradually decreased by the police.\nIn India, there was no national police force established by the British. The Police Act of 1861 laid the groundwork for a provincial police force.\nDevelopment of Judiciary\n\nHastings initiated the system, but Cornwallis made it workable.\n\nREFORMS TO THE JUDICIARY UNDER WARREN HASTINGS\nTo settle civil issues involving both Hindu and Muslim law, district-level Diwani Adalats were set up.\nThe Sadar Diwani Adalat heard the appeal from the District Diwani Adalats.\nThe Sadar Nizamat Adalat in Murshidabad, which oversaw the death penalty and the purchase of land, was run by a deputy Nizam (an Indian Muslim) with assistance from the senior mufti and chief qazi.\nA Supreme Court was established in Calcutta by the Regulating Act of 1773 with the power to hear cases involving all British subjects, including Indians and Europeans, who were present in Calcutta and its associated factories. It was a court with both original and appellate jurisdiction.\nCHANGES MADE BY CORNWALLIS\nCornwallis dissolved the District Fauzadari Court, and Circuit Courts were set up at Calcutta, Decca, Murshidabad, and Patna.\nEuropean justices sit on its appeals court, which handles both civil and criminal issues.\nHe transferred Sadar Nizamat Adalat to Calcutta, where it was overseen by the Governor-General and Supreme Council members, with the help of Chief Qazi and Chief Mufti.\nA district judge presided over the District, City, or Zila Court, which had been renamed from the District Diwani Adalat.\nALTERATIONS MADE BY WILLIAM BENTINCK\nThe four Circuit Courts were dissolved under William Bentinck, and the duties of the former courts were given to collectors who were supervised by the commissioner of revenue and circuit.\nThe Sadar Diwani Adalat and the Sadar Nizamat Adalat were founded in Allahabad.\nHe established English as the official language for Supreme Court sessions, Persian, and vernacular language for lower court proceedings.\nMacaulay formed the Law Commission during his rule, which codified Indian laws.\nThis commission served as the foundation for the creation of the Civil Procedure Code of 1859, the Indian Penal Code of 1860, and the Criminal Procedure Code of 1861.\n\nAlso read: The Changes introduced by the British in India \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nDevelopment of Civil Services\n\nThe East India Company established a civil service system in India for the benefit of its commercial concerns, and it eventually developed into a well-organized system to handle the administrative affairs of India\u2019s newly acquired territories.\n\n\u00a0CHARTER ACT 1853\nThe 1853 Charter Act, which required that future hiring be done through an open competition, ended the Company\u2019s patronage.\nOn the other side, Indians were prohibited from prominent posts from the beginning.\nAll positions worth 500 pounds annually were reserved for the Company\u2019s covenanted servants under the Charter Act of 1793.\nINDIAN CIVIL SERVICE ACT 1861\nThe Indian Civil Services Act was passed under the viceroyalty of Lord Canning.\nCertain jobs were reserved for covenanted civil servants under this Act, however, the examination was conducted in English and was based on classical Greek and Latin knowledge.\nThe legal age limit gradually dropped from 23 in 1859 to 22 in 1860, 21 in 1866, and 19 in 1909. (in 1878).\nSTATUTORY CIVIL SERVICE\nIn 1878\u20131879, Lytton formed the Statutory Civil Service, with Indians of high families filling one-sixth of covenanted jobs through local government nominations, subject to ratification by the secretary of state and the viceroy.\nThe system was repealed because it was ineffective.\nAITCHISON COMMISSION,1886\nIn 1886, a commission headed by Sir Charles Aitchison was established to come up with a strategy for including Indians in all areas of government service.\nIt was intended to examine the question of Indian employment in both the uncovenanted service that covered lower-level administrative jobs as well as the appointments typically reserved by law for members of the covenanted civil service.\nThe Statutory Civil Service was proposed to be abolished, and the civil services were divided into three groups: Imperial, Provincial, and Subordinate.\n\u00a0MONTFORD REFORM 1919\nThree levels of service categorization were recommended by the Government of India Act on Constitutional Reforms of 1919: All India, Provincial, and Subordinate.\nThe term \u201cAll India Services\u201d was used to describe all Imperial services present at the period in the provinces, whether in reserved or transferred departments.\nIn terms of dismissal, pay, pensions and other rights, All India Services employees received special protections.\nThe Act advocated the creation of a Public Service Commission charged with hiring for the service as a defence against political interference.\n\u00a0LEE COMMISSION,1924\nThe British government created the Lee Commission in 1923 to look into the racial makeup of the superior Indian public services provided by the Indian government.\nThe committee, which included both British and Indian members in equal numbers, was led by Lord Lee of Fareham.\nThe Lee Commission suggested in 1924 that 20% of new recruits come from the provincial service and that 40% of future entrants be British, and 40% be directly recruited Indians.\n\u00a0GOVERNMENT OF INDIA ACT,1935\nWithin their respective spheres, the 1935 Act proposed the establishment of a Federal Public Service Commission and a Provincial Public Service Commission.\nHowever, positions of control and authority remained in British hands, and the process of Indianisation of civil service did not provide Indians with effective political power because Indian bureaucrats acted as agents of colonial rule.\n\nAlso read\u00a0Civil Service Reforms during British; The British Expansion in India \u2013 East India Company, Presidencies, Governor-generals, and Battles \u2013 ClearIAS;\u00a0\n\nA new system of land holding and Land Revenue\n\nA few New systems of land holding and Land Revenue were introduced by the British. They were :\n\nPERMANENT SETTLEMENT\n\nThe Permanent Land Revenue Settlement of Bengal was the administrative action taken by Lord Cornwallis that garnered the most attention. The introduction of the Permanent Settlement for Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa occurred in 1793. Its unique characteristics were:\n\nThe Bengali zamindars were acknowledged as landowners as long as they made regular payments of income to the East India Company.\n\nThe revenue the zamindars were required to pay the Company was set in stone and could not be increased under any circumstances. In other words, the zamindars received the remaining 11% while the East India Company\u2019s government received 89%.\nBecause they were regarded as the soil\u2019s tillers, the ryots were made tenants.\nThis agreement eliminated the zamindars\u2019 judicial and administrative duties. Therefore, this elite was bound to support British rule by its own fundamental interests.\nRYOTWARI SETTLEMENT\n\nPrimarily in Madras, Berar, Bombay, and Assam were introduced. This technique was implemented in the Madras Presidency by Sir Thomas Munro.\n\nThe peasant was acknowledged as the landowner under this arrangement.\nThe peasantry and the government did not have a middleman like a zamindar.\nThe peasant has not kicked off the land as long as he paid the revenue on time.\nThe land revenue was set for increments of 20 to 40 years.\n\nHere, the British also recognised peasants who paid state taxes directly and members of local groups known as mirasdars. These mirasdars rose to become modest landowners. The following three factors, however, nullified the ryot\u2019s claim of ownership. They had to pay revenue even when their produce was destroyed in whole or in part because of the following: a. exorbitant land revenue; b. the government\u2019s right to increase land revenue at will.\n\n\u00a0MAHALWARI SETTLEMENT\nThe Mahalwari settlement was first established in 1833 in Punjab, Central Provinces, and portions of the North Western Provinces. The village or the Mahal served as the fundamental unit of revenue settlement under this system.\nThe entire Mahal, or village community, was in charge of paying the revenue because the village properties belonged to them all jointly. As a result, when the revenue was set, the village\u2019s whole land area was measured.\nAlthough the Mahalwari system did away with middlemen between the government and the local community and improved irrigation facilities, the government was the primary beneficiary of its benefits.\nConclusion\n\nDue to nationalist pressure, there was a sluggish process of Indianization after 1918, but crucial and senior jobs were still held by Europeans. The future of modern India was greatly influenced by changes in India\u2019s governmental structure and policies. Positions of power and authority continued to be held by the British, nevertheless, the process of indigenizing the civil service did not give Indians real political sway because Indian bureaucrats served as proxies for colonial administration.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

He lived during the Sangam era of Tamil classical culture. He is renowned as a poet, philosopher, and wise man. Read here to know more about his life and works.\n\nThiruvalluvar was one the great poet-philosophers of the Indian subcontinent during the Sangam period.\n\nSangam is a collective term for an academy of eminent poets. The earliest Tamil literature that has survived is called Sangam literature. The earliest of these poems date back more than 2,000 years.\n\nThe majority of academics believe that these Sangam poems were written between 300 BCE and 300 CE.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSangam era\nLife of Thiruvalluvar\nThirukkural\nLegacy of Thiruvalluvar\nSangam era\n\nSubscribe to the ClearIAS YouTube Channel for more informative videos on UPSC preparation, tips, and strategies.

The poetry and other writings were fortunately mostly preserved as palm leaf manuscripts in Tamil academic houses and Shaiva Aatheenams close to Kumbakonam.\n\nBefore the palm leaves deteriorate, which takes around 50 years, replacements must be made by writing them down on fresh palm leaves.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, all of that changed.\n\nIn 1812, Thirukural was edited and printed from manuscripts by Francis Whyte Ellis. He was working as a Collector in the Madras Presidency when he published the Thirukural created by Thiruvalluvar.\n\nLife of Thiruvalluvar\n\nThiruvalluvar, also known as Valluvar, was a well-known Tamil philosopher and poet. His most famous work, the Tirukkural, is a collection of couplets addressing morality, politics, the economy, and love. The book is regarded as a unique and highly esteemed piece of Tamil literature.\n\nAccording to Kamil Zvelebil, a specialist in Tamil literature, there is essentially no reliable information accessible regarding Valluvar.\u00a0Different biographers have drawn different conclusions about his life and likely background from his literary works.\n\nHis family history, religion, or location of birth are all unknown certainties. According to traditional narratives and linguistic examinations of his texts, he is thought to have resided at least temporarily in the town of Mylapore, which is a neighborhood of modern-day Chennai.\n\nHis floruit is variously dated from the 4th century BCE to the early 6th century CE. Valluvar was born in 31 BCE according to Maraimalai Adigal, but according to Kamil Zvelebil, the ideal time to date the Thirukkural and Thiruvalluvar are between 500 and 600 CE.\n\nAccording to traditional accounts, thirukkural was the last work of the third Sangam.\n\nIn January 1935, the Tamil Nadu government officially recognized 31 BCE as the year of Valluvar.\n\nValluvar is generally thought to have belonged to either Jainism or Hinduism. Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism were the three religions that flourished in the Indian subcontinent during the time of Valluvar.\n\nHe has been speculated to be a learned Jain with in-depth knowledge of the Tamil classical period.\n\nThiruvalluvar was an accomplished poet and administrator in addition to his work in philosophy, for which he is best known.\n\nThirukkural\n\nTirukkural or Kural is the primary work credited to Thiruvalluvar. It contains 1330 couplets, which are divided into 133 sections of 10 couplets each.\n\nThe first 38 sections are on moral and cosmic order (Tamil: Aram, Sanskrit: dharma)\nthe next 70 are about political and economic matters (Tamil: porul, Sanskrit: artha)\nthe remaining 25 are about pleasure (Tamil: inbam, Sanskrit: kama).\n\nIt is considered one of the greatest works on ethics and morality, and it is known for its universality and secular nature.\n\nIt places a strong emphasis on moral vegetarianism and nonviolence as personal characteristics.\n\nIt emphasizes integrity, restraint, thankfulness, hospitality, kindness, wifely goodness, duty, generosity, and other virtues.\n\nAlong with a broad range of social and political subjects like the king, ministers, taxes, justice, forts, war, the greatness of the army and the honor of soldiers, the death penalty for the wicked, agriculture, education, and abstention from alcohol and intoxicants\n\nChapters on household life, friendship, and love are also included.\n\nThe Tirukkural text has been translated into several Indian and international languages. It was translated into Latin by Constanzo Beschi in 1730, which helped make the work known to European intellectuals.\n\nThiruvalluvar\u2019s straightforward yet profound insights into human nature are what made his teachings so timeless.\n\nHe offers insightful guidance on how to live a decent life while delving into a number of topics, including love, wisdom, justice, and renunciation.\n\nThiruvalluvar\u2019s philosophy stresses the importance of ethics and places a strong emphasis on self-discipline, honesty, and equality.\n\nLegacy of Thiruvalluvar\n\nValluvar is revered and highly regarded in Tamil culture, which is evident in the nine different names that his writings have been given: Tirukkural (the sacred kural), Uttaravedam (the ultimate Veda), Thiruvalluvar (named after the author), Poyyamoli (the falseness word), Vayurai valttu (truthful praise), Teyvanul (the divine book), Potumarai (the common Veda), M (the Tamil Veda).\n\nThroughout the Southern part of India, Valluvar is traditionally revered as a god and saint by numerous people. Many communities revere Valluvar as the 64th Nayanmar of the Shaivite tradition, notably those in Mylapore and Tiruchuli.\n\nIn South India, there are numerous temples solely devoted to Valluvar. The temple in Chennai\u2019s Mylapore is the most well-known of these. The temple was constructed in the early 16th century and is situated within the Mylapore Ekambareeswara-Kamakshi (Shiva-Parvati) temple complex.\n\nThe Government of Tamil Nadu celebrates the 15th (16th on leap years) of January as Thiruvalluvar Day in the poet\u2019s honor, as part of the Pongal celebrations.\n\nThiruvalluvar Day was first celebrated on 17 and 18 May 1935.\n\nAlso Read: Sangam Literature\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Read here to learn more about the life of Swami Vivekananda.\n\nSwami Vivekananda was one of India\u2019s most influential spiritual leaders and thinkers.\n\nA major figure in the Indian independence movement and the revival of Hinduism in India, he was also a philosopher, monk, and teacher. Along with his contributions to the realm of education, he is well renowned for his work to empower Indian youth. The youth of India are greatly impacted by his teachings on nationalism, education, and spirituality.\n\nSince 1985, Vivekananda\u2019s teachings have been honored and recognized on Swamiji\u2019s birth anniversary, which the Indian government designated as National Youth Day in 1984.

Vishwanath Datta, his father, worked as a lawyer at the Calcutta High Court. Sanskrit and Persian scholar Durgacharan Datta, Narendra\u2019s grandfather, abandoned his family at age 25 to become a monk. Bhubaneswari Devi, his mother, was a devoted housewife.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nNarendra\u2019s father had a progressive, logical outlook, while his mother had a devout temperament, both of which influenced his way of thinking and personality.\n\nIn Swami Vivekananda\u2019s words, \u201cI am indebted to my mother for the efflorescence of my knowledge.\u201d\n\nHe was enrolled in Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar\u2018s Metropolitan Institution, at the age of 8. He was the sole student to pass the Presidency College admission exam with first-division grades.\n\nHe was a voracious reader who loved philosophy, theology, history, social science, art, and literature, among many other topics. He also had a keen interest in the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas, among other Hindu texts.\n\nNarendra received training in Indian classical music and routinely engaged in organized events, sports, and physical activity.\n\nAt the General Assembly\u2019s Institution, Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy, and European history (now known as the Scottish Church College). He passed the Fine Arts test in 1881, and in 1884 he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nForay into spiritualism\n\nIn 1880, Narendra joined Keshab Chandra Sen\u2019s Nava Vidhan, which was established by Sen after meeting Ramakrishna.\n\nAround 1884, Narendra became a member of a Freemasonry lodge and the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore.\n\nFrom 1881 to 1884, he was also active in Sen\u2019s Band of Hope, which tried to discourage youths from smoking and drinking.\n\nIn 1881 Narendra met Ramakrishna Paramahamsa who became his guru after the former\u2019s father\u2019s death in 1884.\n\nNarendra first learned about Ramakrishna when he heard Professor William Hastie discussing William Wordsworth\u2019s work The Excursion in a literature lesson at General Assembly\u2019s Institution. Hastie advised his students to visit Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar to better comprehend the meaning of the word \u201ctrance\u201d when he was defining it in the poem.\nSome of his pupils, including Narendra, decided to go see Ramakrishna as a result.\n\nInitially, he opposed Ramakrishna\u2019s ideas, but was attracted by his personality and hence began to frequently visit him at Dakshineswar.\n\nNarendra initially saw Ramakrishna\u2019s ecstasies and visions as mere figments of imagination and hallucinations.\n\nAs a member of Brahmo Samaj, he opposed idol worship, polytheism, and Ramakrishna\u2019s worship of Kali. He even rejected the Advaita Vedanta of \u201cidentity with the absolute\u201d as blasphemy and madness and often ridiculed the idea.\n\nRamakrishna encouraged Narendra to see the truth from all angles.\n\nIn 1886, Ramakrishna died of throat cancer, before which he formed his first monastic order with Narendra as its leader.\n\nLater, Narendra and other disciples founded the Ramakrishna math in Baranagar where they practiced meditation and religious austerities.\n\nNarendranath took his monastic vows late in 1886 and took the name Swami Vivekananda.\n\nSwami Vivekananda\u2019s monastic life\n\nFrom 1888 to 1893, Swami Vivekananda traveled all over India as and wandering monk visiting several centers of learning.\n\nIn 1893, Vivekananda left for Chicago from Bombay via China, Japan, and Canada to take part in the \u201cParliament of Religions\u201d.\n\nSwami Vivekananda\u2019s speech at the parliament made him popular as a great orator and influential figure from India. After the Parliament of Religions, he toured many parts of the US as a guest.\n\nVivekananda spent nearly two years lecturing in the eastern and central United States, primarily in Chicago, Detroit, Boston, and New York.\n\nHe founded the Vedanta Society of New York in 1894.\nBy spring 1895 his busy, tiring schedule had affected his health.\n\nHe visited the UK in 1895 and 1896 for lectures, where he also met with Margaret Elizabeth Noble, an Irish woman who later became Sister Nivedita.\n\nIn 1896, Vivekananda met Max M\u00fcller, a noted Indologist from Oxford University who wrote Ramakrishna\u2019s first biography in the West.\n\nVivekananda\u2019s success led to a change in mission, namely the establishment of Vedanta centers in the West.\n\nAn important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his \u201cfour yogas\u201d model, which includes Raja yoga, his interpretation of Patanjali\u2019s Yoga sutras, which offered a practical means to realize the divine force within which is central to modern western esotericism.\n\nHe returned to India in 1897 and gave his first lecture on the east in Colombo, and later in several cities of southern India during his travel to Calcutta.\n\nFounding of the Ramakrishna Mission\n\nIn 1897 in Calcutta, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission for social service. Its ideals are based on Karma Yoga, and its governing body consisted of the trustees of the Ramakrishna Math.\n\nVivekananda founded two other monasteries: one in Mayavati in the Himalayas (near Almora), the Advaita Ashrama, and another in Madras (now Chennai).\n\nHe also founded two journals \u2013 Prabuddha Bharata in English and Udbhodan in Bengal.\n\nSwami Vivekananda again visited the west between 1899 and 1900, for more religious lectures and the establishment of more Vedanta societies.\n\nDeath\n\nHis health was declining due to asthma, diabetes, and insomnia, hence he restricted his travels and activities after 1900.\n\nOn July 4, 1902, Swami Vivekananda died while meditating in Belur math.\n\nTeachings and Philosophy of Swami Vivekananda\n\nSwami Vivekananda was one of the most celebrated spiritual leaders of India. He was a prolific thinker, great orator, and passionate patriot. He carried on the free-thinking philosophy of his guru, Ramakrishna Paramhansa forward into a new paradigm.\n\nVivekananda propagated that the essence of Hinduism was best expressed in Adi Shankara\u2019s Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Nevertheless, following Ramakrishna, and in contrast to Advaita Vedanta, Vivekananda believed that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent.\n\nHe worked tirelessly towards betterment of the society, in servitude to the poor and needy, dedicating his all to his country. He was responsible for the revival of Hindu spiritualism and established Hinduism as a revered religion on the world stage.\n\nHis message of universal brotherhood and self-awakening remains relevant, especially in the current backdrop of widespread political turmoil around the world.\n\nNationalism was a prominent theme in Swami Vivekananda\u2019s thoughts. He believed that a country\u2019s future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development.\n\nEven though he only lived for two years of the 20th century, Swami Vivekananda made the highest ideals of the Vedantic faith relevant to it and left his mark on both the East and the West.\n\nVivekananda was one of the intellectuals who gave the Indian freedom movement its greatest impetus. Great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Aurobindo Ghosh, Hemchandra Ghosh, and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose all looked up to him as a source of inspiration. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had called Vivekananda the \u201cmaker of modern India\u201d.\n\n\u00ad-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Read to know more.\u00a0\n\nBefore independence, India was divided into Princely States, Territories of British India, and colonial territories of Portugal and France. The Government of India Act, of 1935 provided for the establishment of an All-India Federation consisting of provinces and princely states as units but due to certain conditions, the proposed federation never came up.\n\nLater, a Cabinet commission came to India in 1946 and it said that princely states were no longer under the paramountcy of the British government and they would be free to enter into an arrangement with the successor government or to remain free.\n\nThe British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act on July 5, 1947, which was based on the Mountbatten Plan. Some Princely States were dreaming of becoming free and independent. This was one of the major problems of Independent India.\n\nThe problem is also sometimes referred to as national integration or the integration of Indian people as a political community.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPost-Independence Consolidation of India\nStage I of Post-Independence consolidation\nIntegration of Junagarh\nIntegration of Kashmir\nIntegration of Hyderabad\nStage II of Post-Independence Consolidation\nReorganization of India\nS.K.

In July 1947, VallabhBhai Patel took charge of the new States Department and V P Menon as its secretary.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nStage I of Post-Independence consolidation\n\nPatel was fully aware of the danger posed to Indian unity by the possible intransigence of the rulers of the states. He took the following approach toward princely states:\n\nHe appealed to the princes whose territories fell inside India to accede to the Indian Union in three subjects that affected the common interests of the country, namely, foreign relations, defense, and communications.\n\nHe also threatened that he would not be able to restrain the impatient people of the states and that the government\u2019s terms after 15 August would be stiffer.\n\nHence,\u00a0 all states except Kashmir, Hyderabad, and Junagarh had signed an \u2018instrument of accession\u2019 with the Indian government, acknowledging central authority over defense, external affairs, and communication.\n\nDue to these efforts, from June to August 15th, 1947, 562 of the 565 India-linked states signed the instrument of accession.\n\nThe Prince agreed he knew that they were not real rulers(they were ruling under British paramountcy) and still they were getting fair compensation.\n\nFor instance, Prince got a handsome privy purse, the amount was linked to the revenue earned by each state.\n\nThere was no change in the internal political structure.\nPeople of these states wanted to become part of India.\nINTEGRATION OF JUNAGARH\nJunagarh was situated in the Kathiawar region of western India. Though over 70% of its population was Hindu, Junagadh was ruled by a Muslim nawab Muhammad Mahabat Khanji III.\nAlthough its boundary did not touch Pakistan, yet, its Nawab announced the accession of his state to Pakistan on 15 August 1947 even though the people of the state, overwhelmingly Hindu, desired to join India.\nPeople organized a popular movement, forced the Nawab to flee, and established a provisional government.\nThe Dewan of Junagadh, Shah Nawaz Bhutto now decided to invite the Government of India to intervene.\nA plebiscite was held in the state in February 1948 which went overwhelmingly in favour of joining India.\nINTEGRATION OF KASHMIR\nIt shared a border with both Pakistan and India. Here, a Hindu king Maharaja Hari Singh ruled over a population that was overwhelmingly Muslim. The king was reluctant to join both India and Pakistan.\nThe popular political forces led by the National Conference and its leader Sheikh Abdullah, however, wanted to join India.\nThe Indian political leaders took no steps to obtain Kashmir\u2019s accession and, in line with their general approach, wanted the people of Kashmir to decide whether to link their fate with India or Pakistan.\nBut Pakistan refused to accept the principle of plebiscite in this case, unlike Junagarh and Hyderabad.\nOn 22 October, with the onset of winter, several Pathan tribesmen, led unofficially by Pakistani army officers, invaded Kashmir and rapidly pushed towards Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir.\nOn 24 October, the Maharaja appealed to India for military assistance. Nehru, even at this stage, did not favour accession without ascertaining the will of the people.\nOn 26 October, the Maharaja acceded to India and also agreed to install Abdullah as head of the state\u2019s administration.\nEven though both the National Conference and the Maharaja wanted firm and permanent accession, India, in conformity with its democratic commitment, announced that it would hold a referendum on the accession decision once peace and law and order had been restored in the Valley.\nAfter the accession, Indian leaders immediately took steps to fly troops to Srinagar. Srinagar was first held and then the raiders were gradually driven out of the valley.\nTo establish lasting peace, The Indian government approached the UNSC against the aggression undertaken by Pakistan in Kashmir.\nFollowing a resolution of the UNSC, both India and Pakistan accepted a ceasefire on 31st December 1948 which is still prevailing. In 1951, the UN passed a resolution providing for a referendum under UN supervision after Pakistan had withdrawn its troops from the part of Kashmir under its control.\nThe resolution has remained infructuous since Pakistan has refused to withdraw its forces from what is known as Azad Kashmir.\nSince then India has regarded Kashmir\u2019s accession as final and irrevocable and Kashmir as its integral part.\nINTEGRATION OF HYDERABAD\nHyderabad was the largest state in India and was surrounded by Indian territory. Still, Nawab of Hyderabad claimed an independent status and, encouraged by Pakistan, began to expand its armed forces.\nWithout Hyderabad, there would be a large gap in the center of the Indian Territory, potentially posing a constant threat to India\u2019s security in the future. Thus, Hyderabad was essential for India\u2019s unity.\nAfter several rounds of negotiations, India signed a \u201cStandstill Agreement\u201d, a temporary and year-long agreement, maintaining the status quo. India signed an agreement hoping the Nizam would establish a democratic government.\nHowever, Nizam intended to delay the process and expand his military strength to force India to accept his independence or succeed.\nBy June 1948, Sardar Patel was getting impatient as the negotiations with the Nizam dragged on. By June 1948, Sardar Patel was getting impatient as the negotiations with the Nizam dragged on.\nFinally, on 13 September 1948, the Indian army moved into Hyderabad. The Nizam surrendered after three days and acceded to the Indian Union in November.\n\nWith the accession of Hyderabad, the merger of princely states with the Indian Union was completed, and the Government of India\u2019s writ ran all over the land.\n\nStage II of Post-Independence Consolidation\n\n\u00a0The second phase involved a much more difficult process of \u2018integration of states with neighboring provinces or into new units like the Kathiawar Union, Vindhya and Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan or Himachal Pradesh along with internal constitutional changes in states which for some years retained their old boundaries(Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore-cochin).\n\nThis was accomplished within a year.\n\nA large number were consolidated into five new unions, forming Madhy a Bharat, Rajasthan, Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU), Saurashtra and Travancore-Cochin; My sore, Hyderabad and Jammu and Kashmir retained their original form as separate states of the Union.\n\nThe rapid political unification of the country after independence was Patel\u2019s greatest achievement.\n\nReorganization of India\n\n\u00a0At the time of independence in 1947, India consisted of 571 disjointed princely states that were merged to form 27 states. The grouping of states at the time was done based on political and historical considerations rather than on linguistic or cultural divisions, but this was a temporary arrangement.\n\nOn account of the multilingual nature and differences that existed between various states, there was a need for the states to be reorganized permanently.\n\nBack in the 1920s, the Indian National Congress \u2013 the main party of the freedom struggle \u2013 had promised that once the country won independence, each major linguistic group would have its province.\n\nHowever, After independence, Congress did not take any steps to honor this promise.\n\nShortly after independence, movements for the linguistic reorganization of states gained momentum in several states. After partition, the then Prime Minister Nehru was wary of further separating the country based on language following the painful religious partition.\n\nHowever, as evidenced by the movements for Ayikya Kerala, Samyukta Maharashtra, and Vishalandhra, calls for a distinct state based on linguistic identity gained traction.\n\nIn 1948 the Linguistic Provinces Commission, headed by\n\nJustice S.K. Dhar, to enquire into the desirability of linguistic provinces, was appointed by the Constituent Assembly.\n\nS.K. Dar commission,1948\n\nThe Dar Commission advised against the step at the time for it might threaten national unity and also be administratively inconvenient. Consequently, the Constituent Assembly decided not to incorporate the linguistic principle in the constitution.\n\nJVP Committee,1948\n\nWith the Dhar committee recommendation, Public opinion was not satisfied, especially in the South, and the problem remained politically alive.\n\nTo appease the vocal votaries of linguistic states, the Congress appointed a committee (JVP) in December 1948 consisting of Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, and Pattabhi Sitaramayya, president of the Congress, to examine the question afresh. This committee advised against the creation of linguistic states, for the time being, emphasizing unity, national security, and economic development as the needs of the hour.\n\nGroups of States After Independence\n\nIn 1951, India had 27 states divided into four parts: Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D.\n\nPart A: Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Bombay, Madhya Pradesh (formerly Central Provinces and Berar), Madras, Orissa, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh (formerly United Provinces)were among the nine states in Part A.\nPart B: Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir, Saurashtra, Mysore, Travancore-Cochin, Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh, Patiala, and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU), and Rajasthan were the nine Part B states.\nPart C: Delhi, Kutch, Himachal Pradesh, Bilaspur, Coorg, Bhopal, Manipur, Ajmer, Cooch-Behar, and Tripura were among the ten Part C states. Except for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Part C states included both former Chief Commissioners\u2019 provinces and other centrally administered areas.\nPart D: The Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Part D) was a territory ruled by a governor appointed by the Indian President.\nFormation of Andhra\n\nOn 19 October 1952, a popular freedom fighter, Patti Sriramalu, undertook a fast unto death over the demand for a separate Andhra which expired after fifty-eight days. The State of Andhra was created as the first linguistic state(Telugu speaking).\n\nState Reorganization Commission\n\nIn August 1953, the Then PM, Pt. Nehru appointed the States\n\nReorganisation Commission (SRC), with Justice Fazl Ali, K.M. Panikkar, and Hriday Nath Kunzru as members, to examine \u2018objectively and dispassionately \u2019 the entire question of the reorganization of the states of the Union.\n\nSRC widely accepted language as the foundation for state reorganization. It did, however, reject the theory of \u2018one language, one state.\u2019\nThe SRC recommended the conversion of the four kinds of states into two categories States and Union territories and the merger of the erstwhile Part B state of Hyderabad with Andhra.\nStates Reorganisation Act: To give effect to the scheme of reorganization, the States Reorganisation Act, of 1956, was enacted by the Parliament under Article 4 of the Constitution of India.\n7thConstitutional Amendment: To implement the States Reorganisation Act, the Constitution introduced the 7thConstitutional Amendment, which received the Indian President\u2019s assent on October 19, 1956.\nAbolition of Part A, B, and D: This amendment not only resulted in the formation of new states by altering the areas and boundaries of the then-existing states, but it also resulted in the abolition of Part A, Part B, and Part C states and the designation of certain areas as Union Territories.\nThe States Reorganisation Act of 1956 reduced the number of states from 27 to 14.\nThe states were Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Bombay, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Madras, Mysore, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The six union territories were Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Laccadive, Minicoy, and Amindivi Islands, Manipur, and Tripura.\n\nSRC opposed the division of Bombay & Punjab; Therefore, Maharashtra, where massive rioting occurred, was the location with the strongest response to the SRC report.\n\nNew States and union territories created after 1956\n\nThe demand for the creation of some more states based on language or cultural homogeneity resulted in the bifurcation of existing states.\n\nMAHARASHTRA AND GUJARAT\n\nIn 1960, The bilingual state of Bombay was divided(Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960) into two separate states- Maharashtra for Marathi-speaking people and Gujarat(15th state) for Gujarati-speaking people.\n\nDADRA AND NAGAR HAVELI\n\nThe Portuguese ruled this territory until its liberation in 1954. Subsequently, the administration was carried on till 1961 by an administrator chosen by the people themselves. It was converted into a union territory of India by the 10th Constitutional Amendment Act, of 1961.\n\nGOA, DAMAN, AND DIU\n\nIndia acquired these three territories from the Portuguese using police action in 1961 and by the 12th CAA, 1962, They constituted a union territory later Goa was Statehood in 1987.\n\nPUDUCHERRY\n\nFormer French establishments in India- Puducherry, Karaikal, Yanam, and Mahe\n\nThe French handed over this territory to India in 1954 and by the 14th CAA, it was made a union territory.\n\nNAGALAND\n\nIn 1963, the state of Nagaland out of Assam was created for the Nagas. It was meant to protect their culture and ethnicity. However, the division was also done based on geographical reasons.\n\nHARYANA, CHANDIGARH, AND HIMACHAL PRADESH\n\nPunjab Reorganization Act was passed in 1966. According to this, the state of Punjabi-speaking areas was made Haryana, and the hilly regions joined with Himachal Pradesh.\n\nIn addition, Chandigarh was made to serve as the joint capital for Punjab and Haryana. This followed the demand of \u2018 Sikh Homeland\u2019 by Akalidal and on the recommendation of the Shah Commission.\n\nThe later union territory of Himachal Pradesh was elevated to a full-fledged State in 1971.\n\nMANIPUR, TRIPURA AND MEGHALAYA\n\nOn January 21, 1972, Tripura, Meghalaya, and Manipur became states under the North Eastern Region Reorganization Act of 1971.\n\nSIKKIM\n\nTill 1947, Sikkim was ruled by Chogyal. After the lapse of British paramountcy, Sikkim became a \u2018protectorate of India\u2019. In 1974, Sikkim has conferred the status of a new class of state called \u2018associate state\u2019 by the 35th CAA.\n\nHowever, this experiment did not last long and in 1975 a referendum was held and the people of Sikkim voted for the abolition of the institution of Chogyal and Sikkim became an integral part of India.\n\nConsequently, Sikkim became a full-fledged state by the 36th CAA in 1976.\n\nMIZORAM AND ARUNACHAL PRADESH\n\nMizoram, Arunachal Pradesh in February 1987 also acquired the status of state.\n\nCHHATTISGARH, UTTARAKHAND, AND JHARKHAND\n\nThe 9th of November 2000 saw the separation of Uttar Pradesh into Uttarakhand(Uttranchal), which became India\u2019s 27th state.\n\nLack of development in a geographically distinct region 93% of the land is hilly, and 64% of the overall area is forest and rising unemployment sparked the long-standing call for a separate state.\n\nAfter a prolonged struggle for their separate state demand, the central government made Jharkhand-28th state of India on November 15th, 2000.\n\nThe demand for a separate state was later advanced by other tribal organizations and movements, including the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, led by Shibu Soren.\n\nChhattisgarh was created out of the territory of Madhya Pradesh on November 1, 2000. Despite having such vast natural resource storage, the area was heavily underdeveloped, which was the main reason behind the demand for Chhattisgarh.\n\nTELANGANA\n\nIn 1956, Telangana and Andhra combined to become Andhra Pradesh. The Telangana Praja Samiti, led by Marri Channa Reddy, started an agitation in the area in 1969. Long periods passed during the conflict with no breakthrough.\n\nTelangana finally became the 29th Indian state in 2014, under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act.\n\n\u00a0JAMMU AND KASHMIR AND LADAKH\nUntil 2019 Jammu and Kashmir exercised special powers under Article 35A. It empowered the state\u2019s legislature to define permanent residents of the state and enable them to exercise extraordinary powers and privileges.\nOn August 6, 2019, Parliament amended Article 370 of the Constitution, abolishing Jammu & Kashmir\u2019s special status and bifurcating and downgrading the state into Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh, with Jammu and Kashmir having its legislative assembly.\nThis is the first time that Union Territories have been created within a state.\nLadakh is made up of the Kargil and Leh districts, while the remainder of the region is part of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThere are still unmet requests for state formation based on a variety of factors, including ethnicity, lack of development, and administrative difficulties.

The main animal motifs include a fox, a lizard with many legs, and a creature with a long nose. There are also wavy lines, geometric patterns with filled rectangles, and clusters of dots.\nEvolution of prehistoric paintings\n\nThe evolution of the prehistoric period consists of Paleolithic, Mesolithic and chalcolithic.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nPALEOLITHIC AGE ART\n\nThe prehistoric period in the early development of human beings is commonly known as the \u2018Old Stone Age \u2019 or \u2018Palaeolithic Age \u2019.\n\nThe Paleolithic period can be divided into three phases:\n\n(1) Lower Palaeolithic (2.5 million years- 100,000 years ago)\n\n(2) Middle Palaeolithic (300,000- 30,000 years ago)\n\n(3) Upper Palaeolithic (40,000- 10,000 years ago)\n\nWe did not get any evidence of paintings from the lower or middle paleolithic age yet.\nIn the Upper Palaeolithic period, we see a proliferation of artistic activities.\nSubjects of early works were confined to simple human figures, human activities, geometric designs, and symbols.\nThe first discovery of rock paintings in the world was made in India (1867-68) by an Archaeologist, Archibold Carlleyle, twelve years before the discovery of Altamira in Spain (the site of the oldest rock paintings in the world).\nIn India, remnants of rock paintings have been found on the walls of caves situated in several districts of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Bihar, and Uttarakhand.\nSome examples of sites of early rock paintings are Lakhudiyar in Uttarakhand, Kupgallu in Telangana, Piklihal, and Tekkalkotta in Karnataka, Bhimbetka and Jogimara in Madhya Pradesh, etc.\nPaintings found here can be divided into three categories: Man, Animal, and Geometric symbols.\n\nSome of the characteristics of these are:\n\nHuman beings are represented in a stick-like form.\nA long-snouted animal, a fox, and a multi-legged lizard are the main animal motifs in the early paintings (later many animals were drawn).\nWavy lines, rectangular-filled geometric designs, and a group of dots also can be seen.\nSuperimposition of paintings \u2013 earliest is Black, then red, and later White.\nIn the late historic, early historic, and Neolithic periods the subjects of paintings developed, and figures like Bulls, Elephants, Sambhars, Gazelles, Sheep, Horses, and styled human beings, tridents, and rarely vegetal motifs began to see.\nThe richest paintings are reported from the Vindhya range of Madhya Pradesh and their Kaimurean extension into U.P.\nThese hills are fully Palaeolithic and Mesolithic remains.\n\nThere are two major sites of excellent prehistoric paintings in India:\n\n(1) Bhimbetka Caves, Foothills of Vindhya, Madhya Pradesh.\n(2) Jogimara caves, Amarnath, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nUPPER PALAEOLITHIC PERIOD\nPaintings are linear representations, in green and dark red, of huge animal figures, such as Bisons, Tigers, Elephants, Rhinos and Boars beside stick-like human figures.\nMostly they are filled with geometric patterns.\nGreen paintings are of dances and red ones of hunters.\nMESOLITHIC PERIOD ART\nThe largest number of paintings belongs to this period.\nThemes multiply but the paintings are small in size.\nHunting scenes predominate\nHunters in groups armed with barbed spears pointed sticks, arrows, and bows.\nTraps and snares used to catch animals can be seen in some paintings.\nMesolithic people loved to point to animals.\nIn some pictures, animals are chasing men and in others, they are being chased by hunter-men.\nAnimals were painted in a naturalistic style and humans were depicted in a stylistic manner.\nWomen are painted both nude and clothed.\nYoung and old equally find places in paintings.\nCommunity dances provide a common theme.\nSort of family life can be seen in some paintings (woman, man, and children).\nCHALCOLITHIC PERIOD ART\nCopper age art.\nThe paintings of this period reveal the association, contact and mutual exchange of requirements of the cave dwellers of this area with settled agricultural communities of the Malwa Plateau.\nPottery and metal tools can be seen in paintings.\nSimilarities with rock paintings: Common motifs (designs/patterns like cross-hatched squares, lattices etc)\nThe difference with rock paintings is Vividness and vitality of older periods disappear from these paintings.\n\nAlso read: Salient Aspects of Art Forms, Literature and Architecture from Ancient to modern times\n\nMural\u00a0 & Cave Paintings\n\nIndian murals have a long history that spans from the 2nd century BC to the 8th \u2013\u00a010th centuries AD. More than 20 locations in India are known to have murals from this time period, mostly in the form of natural caves and rock-cut chambers.\n\nAjanta, Bagh, Sittanavasal, Armamalai Cave, Ravan Chhaya Rock Shelter, and Kailashnath Temple in Ellora Caves are a few locations where this painting can be found.\n\nTo know more about Later Mural Traditions click here.\n\nAjanta paintings\nWith the exception of the decorative patterns on the ceilings and pillars, the subjects of these paintings are almost entirely Buddhist.\nThey are mostly connected to the Jataka, a collection of tales that describes the Lord Buddha\u2019s earlier lives.\n\nNotable specimens\n\nThe earliest paintings at Ajanta are found in cave No. IX and X, and the only one that has survived is a group on cave X\u2019s left wall. This shows a king and his courtiers in front of a flag-draped tree. The King has travelled to the revered Bodhi tree in order to fulfil a vow made to the prince who is present and close to the king.\nOne of the masterpieces of Ajanta Painting created in the late 6th century CE is the painting of the Bodhisattva Padmapani from cave I. This magnificently decorated figure is larger than life-size and is depicted pausing slightly while holding a lotus flower in his right hand.\nThe painting of Maya Devi, the Buddha\u2019s mother, is a lovely representation of female beauty.\nBagh cave Paintings\nThe Ajanta paintings in caves No. I and II match those from the Bagh caves in Madhya Pradesh.\nBoth figures share the same form stylistically, but Bagh figures have stronger outlines and are more precisely modelled.\nCompared to those at Ajanta, they are more earthy and human.\nThe fragments discovered in Badami Cave No. III, dating to the 6th century A.D., are the earliest Brahmanical paintings that are currently known.\nThe Siva and Parvati painting is found to be reasonably well-preserved.\nAlthough the technique is similar to that of Ajanta and Bagh, the modelling is much more expressive and sensitive in texture, and the outline is flexible and soft.\nThe finest examples of the North Indian and Deccan classical traditions can be found in the paintings from Ajanta, Bagh, and Badami.\nThese paintings have darkly drawn contours that stand out against a light red background.\nEllora Paintings\nBetween the 8th and 10th centuries A.D., a number of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain temples were carved out of Ellora\u2019s living rock.\n34 caves total, including 17 Brahmanical, 12 Buddhist, and 5 Jain, are found in the Sahyadri ranges of Maharashtra, about 100 km from Ajanta caves.\nIndra Sabha (Cave 32) and Jagannath Sabha are two well-known Jain caves (Cave 33).\nSharp features and pointed noises characterize sinewy figures.\nBadami cave paintings\nThe early Chalukyan dynasty, which ruled the area from 543 to 598 CE was centred in Badami.\nThe dedication of the image of Vishnu is included in the inscription in Cave No. 4, which also mentions the years 578 and 579 CE and praises the beauty of the cave.\nThis cave has paintings that show scenes from palaces. One depicts Kirtivarman, the elder brother of Mangalesha and the son of Pulakesin I, sitting inside the palace with his wife and feudatories while viewing a dance scene.\nThe paintings here have a similar aesthetic to those in Ajanta.\nThe fluid forms, sinuously drawn lines, and compact composition demonstrate the artists\u2019 skill and maturity by the sixth century CE.\nSittanavasal Paintings\n\nThese paintings feature a variety of subjects, such as animals, fish, ducks, people collecting lotuses from a pond, two dancing figures, etc. In addition, one can discover inscriptions from the 9th and 10th centuries, with Jainism serving as their primary source of inspiration.\n\nPandyas Paintings\n\nJains texts, female figures, etc. Fresco-secco technique. Eg: Armamalai cave paintings.\n\nPallavas Paintings\n\nBeautiful lotus ponds and flowers, dancing people, lilies, fish, geese, buffaloes, and elephants are all present. A rounded face and wide, fully opened eyes. Eg: Kanchipuram Temple Paintings are patronized by Rajasimha.\n\nChola paintings\n\nThe paintings celebrate Lord Shiva.\n\nVijayanagara Paintings\n\nThe works of art depict the Vijayanagara Court\u2019s history and times. Paintings from a secular era decorate the walls of Lepakshi Temple. Eg: Virupaksha Temple, Hampi \u2013 consists of the history of the dynasty and stories of Ramayana and Mahabharatha.\n\nNayaka Paintings\n\nIt is the extension of Vijayanagara paintings. Depicting the story of Mucukunds, a legendary Chola King.\n\nKerala Murals Paintings\n\nInspired by Kathakali and Kalam Ezhuthu. The theme is mostly based on Hindu mythology. Eg: Vadakkunnathan temple, Thrissur, Padmanabhapuram palace, Trivandrum.\n\nAlso read: Indian Folk paintings\n\nMedieval Indian Paintings\n\nMedieval Indian paintings consist of miniature, Pala school, Mughal school, Rajasthani school, Bhundi school, Malwa school, Mewar school, Pahari style, Basohli school, Kangra school, Deccani school etc.\n\nMiniature\n\nAs soon as India made direct contact with Islamic civilization, miniature paintings began to fully blossom. The Mughal Empire (1526\u20131757 AD) brought about the establishment of studios at the Imperial court, which marked the start of a new stage in the development of Indian painting.\n\nFrom there, paintings such as portraits, genre or celebratory scenes, illustrated manuscripts, album miniatures, and a variety of other subjects travelled throughout India. A significant Persian influence was initially present in Indian miniature painting, but it was only temporary as the Indian artists quickly regained their independence and originality.\n\nPala School\u00a0 (8th century CE)\nThe illustrations of religious texts on Buddhism created under the Palas of eastern India and the Jain texts created in western India during the 11th and 12th centuries A.D. are the earliest examples of miniature painting in India.\nAt institutions like Nalanda, Odantapuri, Vikramsila, and Somarupa, a significant number of palm-leaf manuscripts relating to Buddhist themes were written and decorated with pictures of Buddhist deities.\nTo receive education and religious instruction, pilgrims and students from all over South-East Asia gathered there. They brought bronzes and manuscripts, which helped spread the Pala style to Nepal, Tibet, Burma, Sri Lanka, Java, etc., back to their home countries as examples of Buddhist art from the Pala period.\nThe majority of the Pala illustrated manuscripts that have survived are from the Vajrayana School of Buddhism.\nThe painting by Pala displays a naturalistic aesthetic and is distinguished by sinuous lines and subdued colour tones.\nThe Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita manuscript, also known as the perfection of Wisdom written in eight thousand lines, is one of the best examples. It is kept in Oxford, England.\nAfter Muslim invaders decimated the Buddhist monasteries in the first half of the 13th century, Pala art abruptly came to an end. Some of the artists and monks made their way to Nepal, where they helped to strengthen the country\u2019s already-strong artistic traditions.\nColours were used in this form of painting which had symbolic meanings\nMughal school\nIn India\u2019s history of painting, the founding of the Mughal School of Painting is regarded as a turning point.\nThe Mughal School of Painting began with the establishment of the Mughal empire in the reign of Akbar in 1560 CE, who was keenly interested in the art of painting and architecture.\nA painting studio was established at the start of his reign under the direction of two Persian masters, Mir Sayyed Ali and Abdul Samad Khan, who had previously worked for his father Humayun.\nTo work with the Persian masters, a sizable number of Indian artists from all over India were enlisted.\nThe Safavid school of Persian painting and the native Indian painting style came together in a harmonious way to form the Mughal style.\nIt is primarily aristocratic and secular, characterized by supple naturalism based on careful observation of nature and fine and delicate drawing.\nAn illustrated manuscript of the Tuti-Nama in the Cleveland Museum of Art (USA) appears to be the first work of the Mughal School.\nThe Mughal style is depicted in this manuscript\u2019s artwork in its early stages. Soon after, between 1564 and 1569 CE, a very ambitious project known as the Hamza-Nama illustrations on cloth was finished. It originally had 1400 leaves in 17 volumes.\nAlong with the two Persian masters already mentioned, other well-known painters who worked in Akbar\u2019s court included Dasvanth, Miskina, Nanha, Kanha, Basawan, Manohar, Doulat, Mansur,\u00a0\u00a0Kesu, Bhim Gujarati, etc.\nJahangir had a great fascination for nature and took delight in the portraiture of birds, animals, and flowers.\nImportant manuscripts that were illustrated during his reign include the Anwar-i-sunavli, another fable book, and the animal fable book Ayar-i-Danish.\nThe famous painters of Jahangir are Aqa Riza, Abul Hasan, Mansur, Bishan Das, Manohar, Goverdhan, Balchand, Daulat, Mukhlis, Bhim, and Inayat.\nThe portrait of Jahangir illustrated is a typical example of a miniature executed during the period of Jahangir.\nA series of the Razm-Nama dated 1616 CE, a series of the Rasikapriya (1610-1615), and a series of the Ramayana of circa 1610 CE are some other notable examples of the Mughal School.\nThe Gulistan and the Bustan of Sadi, which were copied for the emperor in the first and second years of his reign, and the Shah Jahan Nama, are two notable examples of such manuscripts. Other paintings depicting groups of ascetics and mystics as well as several illustrated manuscripts were also created during his time.\nBeing a puritan, Aurangzeb\u2019s reign saw a decline in the quality of painting and a significant loss of that quality. The provincial courts received a large influx of court painters.\nAfter Aurangzeb\u2019s neglect, there was a revival of Mughal painting during the reign of Bahadur Shah.\nAfter 1712 CE, the Mughal painting again started deteriorating under the later Mughals.\nRajasthani School\n\nAkbar, the succeeding Mughal Emperor, constructed an atelier for them to promote the rich art form. These artists, in turn, trained Indian artists who created paintings in a new distinct style inspired by the Mughals\u2019 royal and romantic lives.\n\nRajput or Rajasthani miniature is a style of miniature created by Indian artists. Several schools of painting emerged during this period, including Mewar (Udaipur), Bundi, Kotah, Marwar (Jodhpur), Bikaner, Jaipur, and Kishangarh.\n\nFeatures:\n\nThe cults of Vaishnavism, Saivism, and Sakti had a huge influence on this school\u2019s pictorial art.\nThe various Krishna cults provided a very rich field for the painter, who made a significant contribution to the development of Indian painting with his artistic skill and devotion.\nThe Rajasthani School of painting is marked by bold drawings and strong and contrasting colours.\nFigures are rendered flatly, with no attempt to depict perspective in a naturalistic manner.\nTo distinguish one scene from another, the surface of the painting is sometimes divided into several compartments of different colours.\nThe Mughal era\u2019s influence can be seen in the drawing\u2019s refinement and the introduction of some naturalism in the figures and trees.\nIn addition to illustrating Ramayana stories, kings\u2019 and queens\u2019 royal lifestyles were also shown.\nAdditionally, they illustrated social norms and the modifications made by kings to advance society. A distinctive aspect of the Rajasthani School was the background of the paintings.\nPaper, ivory, and silk were used as their canvas in this school of painting.\nBundi school\nThis style of painting is dated back to 1625 AD\nA painting showing Bhairavi Ragini, in the Allahabad Museum is one of the earliest examples of a Bundi painting.\nThemes from the life of Krishna are a major theme in this school of painting\nAn illustration of the aforementioned is found in the late 17th-century poem Rasikapriya, which contains a scene in which Krishna attempts to steal butter from a Gopi. However, when he discovers that the pot only contains a piece of cloth and a few other items, not butter, he realizes that the Gopi has tricked him. Trees can be seen in the foreground and a river is shown in the foreground with wavy lines. Flowers and a pair of waterbirds can be seen in the river. The border of the painting is a stunning shade of red.\nThe salient characteristic of this school of painting is the rich and glowing colours, the rising sun in golden colour, crimson-red horizon, overlapping and semi-naturalistic trees\nThe delicate drawing of the faces and the use of naturalism in the treatment of the trees are both examples of Mughal influence. On the top, the text is printed in black on a yellow background.\nMalwa School\n\nIt was most prosperous between 1600 and 1700 CE and is a prime example of Hindu Rajput courts. Malwa School rejects a specific centre for its origin and instead suggests a vast territory of Central India.\n\nThis contrasts with the specificity of Rajasthani schools, which emerged and thrived in precise territorial kingdoms and courts of their respective kings. After the 17th century came to an end, this conservative style vanished.\n\nSalient features of this form of painting\n\nMalwa paintings display a preference for rigidly flat compositions, dark backgrounds (often black or chocolate brown), figures set against solid colour patches, and vibrantly coloured architecture.\nThe school\u2019s most appealing features are a primitive charm and a simple childlike vision.\nThe first piece in this genre is an illustrated Rasikapriy from 1634, followed by a series of illustrations for the Amaru Ataka, a Sanskrit poem (1652).\nThe Bhagavata-Purana, the musical modes (Ragamala), and other Hindu literary and devotional works are also illustrated.\nMewar school\n\nOne of the most significant schools of Indian miniature painting from the 17th and 18th centuries is the Mewar painting. It was created in the Hindu principality of Mewar and is a school in the Rajasthani style (in Rajasthan state).\n\nSalient features\n\nThe works of the school are characterized by simple bright colours and direct emotional appeal.\nThe earliest known Mewar painting is a series of Ragamala paintings by Misardi that were created in 1605 CE in Chawand, a small town close to Udaipur.\nMost of the paintings of this series are in the collection of Shri Gopi Krishna Kanoria.\nThrough 1680, the expressive and dynamic style persisted in the region with some minor variations, after which the Mughal influence became more pronounced.\nDespite the popularity of religious subjects, portraiture and the life of the ruler occupied an increasing number of paintings.\nPahari Style\n\nIn sub-Himalayan India through Himachal Pradesh, from Jammu to Almora and Garhwal, the Pahari style developed and thrived between the 17th and 19th centuries. The Pahari paintings can be divided into two categories: Basholi and Kangra School and Jammu or Dogra School.\n\nThe bold, intense Basohli Painting, which originated in Basohli in Jammu and Kashmir, and the delicate, lyrical Kangra paintings, which came to be associated with the style before other schools of painting emerged, each produced stark variations within the genre.\n\nBasohli School\nThis school of Pahari painting received patronage from Raja Kripal Pal\nFamous works produced by this school include miniatures created in the style of Rasamanjari illustrations by a painter by the name of Devidasa in 1694.\n\nAnother well-known illustration from this school of painting dates to 1730 AD and is taken from a series of paintings by Manaku of the Gita Govinda.\n\nThe facial type changes, becoming a little heavier, and the tree forms take on a more naturalistic appearance, possibly as a result of the Mughal painting\u2019s influence.\n\nIn this miniature, it is possible to see the use of vibrant, contrasting colours, a monochromatic background, big eyes, bold lines, beetles\u2019 wings to depict diamonds in ornaments, a narrow sky, and a red border.\n\nKangra School\n\nThis collection of paintings is referred to as the Kangra style because Raja Sansar Chand of Kangra\u2019s portraits is the only other painter who painted in a similar manner to them. The Nainsukh family is primarily credited with creating paintings in the Kangra style.\n\nBeginning in the early 19th century, some Pahari painters received patronage from Maharaja Ranjit Singh and the Sikh nobility in Punjab, where they painted portraits and other miniatures in a modified Kangra style that persisted through the middle of the century.\n\nSalient features of this school of art:\n\nThis school of art is distinguished by its delicate drawing and naturalistic quality.\nThe Kangra style, which is distinguished by serene beauty and delicate execution, is unquestionably the most poetic of all Indian styles.\nThe most distinguishing aspect of this style is the way in which the female face is defined, with a straight nose that is parallel to the forehead, a trend that began in the 1790s.\nThe most popular themes that were painted were the Bhagvata Purana, Gita Govinda, Nala Damayanti, Bihari Satsai, Ragamala and Baramasa\nDeccani School\n\nThe Deccan painting was created in the Muslim capitals of the Deccan sultanates that emerged from the dissolution of the Bahmani Sultanate by 1520 in the Deccan region of Central India. Bijapur, Golkonda, Ahmadnagar, Bidar, and Berar were among them. The main period was from the late sixteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century, with a revival of sorts in the middle of the eighteenth century, which by that time was centred on Hyderabad.\n\nThe Deccan painting outperforms the early Mughal art that was developing concurrently with the north in \u201cthe brilliance of their colour, the sophistication and artistry of their composition, and a general air of decadent luxury.\u201d Other differences include painting \u201ctall women with small heads\u201d wearing saris and \u201cpoorly modelled\u201d faces in three-quarter view rather than mostly in profile in the Mughal style. Although there are many royal portraits, they do not accurately depict their Mughal counterparts. The representation of buildings is as \u201ctotally flat screen-like panels.\u201d\n\nSub-schools in the Deccani school of painting:\n\nAHMEDNAGAR\nA collection of poems written in honour of Hussain Nizam Shah I of Ahmednagar (1553\u20131565) and his queen contains the earliest examples of the Ahmednagar painting.\nThis manuscript, titled \u201cTarif-in-Hussain Shahi,\u201d dates from the years 1565 to 1569 and is kept at the Bharat ltihas Samshodaka Mandala in Poona.\nThe \u201cHindola Raga\u201d from around 1590 AD and portraits of Burhan Nizam Shah II of Ahmednagar (1591\u201396 AD) and Malik Amber from around 1605 AD, both found in the National Museum in New Delhi and other museums, are some additional fine examples of the Ahmednagar painting.\nPersian influence \u2013 high horizon, gold sky, and landscape.\nBIJAPUR\nAli Adil Shah, I, and his successor Ibrahim II in Bijapur were patrons of the painting.\nThe Najum-al-ulum (Stars of Sciences), an encyclopedia that is now housed in the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, was illustrated in 1570 AD during the reign of Ali Adil Shah I. an 876 miniatures in this manuscript\nThe women depicted in the illustrations are tall and slim and are dressed in South Indian attire.\nThe Deccani tradition is represented by the vibrant colour scheme, the palm trees, the animals, and both men and women. The Persian tradition is reflected in the lavish use of the colour gold, some flowering plants, and the arabesques on top of the throne.\nSome exhibit the Lepakshi temple murals\u2019 influence, especially in how women are portrayed.\nGOLCONDA\nThe earliest paintings recognized as being by Golconda are a collection of five charming works from around 1590 A.D. that are housed in the British Museum in London and were created during the time of Muhammad Quli Quta Shah (1580-1611) Golconda.\nThey show dancing girls entertaining the company.\nThe Golconda painting \u201cLady with the Myna bird,\u201d which was created around 1605 A.D., is yet another outstanding example.\nBoth the southern tradition of the Vijayanagar murals, as seen in the treatment of female types and costumes, and the northern tradition of pre-Mughal painting, which was thriving in Malwa, were influenced by this school of painting. The treatment of the horizon gold sky and landscape also shows the Persian painting\u2019s influence. In contrast to the northern painting, these colours are vibrant and rich.\nHYDERABAD\nThe establishment of the Asafjhi dynasty by Mir Qamruddin Khan marked the beginning of painting in Hyderabad.\nThe style of the painting is decorative.\nThe miniature exhibits typical Deccani facial types and attire, as well as rich colours, which are hallmarks of Hyderabadi paintings. It was created during the third decade of the 18th century.\nTANJORE\nIn South India during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a painting style characterized by bold drawing, shading strategies, and the use of pure and brilliant colours flourished at Tanjore.\nIndian Thanjavur paintings stand out from other types of paintings due to their dense composition, rich surface, and vibrant colours.\nThen, to further enhance their appeal, they are embellished with pearls, glass, and semi-precious stone accents. They appear to be three-dimensional due to the relief work. India\u2019s Tanjore Painting originated back in the sixteenth century.\nFrom the 16th to the 18th centuries, Maratha princes, Nayakas, Rajus communities of Tanjore and Trichi, and Naidus of Madurai were also patrons of Indian Thanjavur Paintings.\nThe majority of these paintings are based on saints and Hindu gods and goddesses.\nThe central figure of the painting is always the main subject. Tanjore paintings are known as \u201cPalagai Padam\u201d in the area because they are typically created on solid wood planks (palagai meaning wooden plank and Padam meaning picture).\nFolk paintings\n\nThe subjects of folk paintings, which are the visual expressions of local painters, are typically taken from epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata and the Bhagavata Purana, as well as from everyday village life, birds and animals, and natural objects like the sun, moon, plants, and trees.\n\nMadhubani Paintings or Mithila paintings\nIt derives its name from Mithila, the ancient Videha and birthplace of Sita\nFor ceremonial occasions, particularly weddings, it is believed that women in this region have painted figures and patterns on the walls of their mud homes for centuries.\nPeople of this area see the origin of this art form at the time Princess Sita gets married to Lord Rama.\nThese paintings, which stand out for their vivid colours, are primarily found in three areas of the house: the central or outer courtyards, the eastern wing, which serves as Kuladevi\u2019s, usually Kali\u2019s, residence, and a room in the southern wing, which contains the most important artwork.\nThe exterior central courtyard is vividly decorated with images of many armed gods and animals as well as women carrying water pots or winnowing grain, among other tasks.\nGriha devatas and kula devatas are painted on the inner verandah, which is where the family shrine\u2014devasthana or gosain ghar\u2014is situated.\nIn the recent past, numerous paintings have been produced for sale on fabric, paper, pots, etc.\nThe most extraordinary and vibrant paintings, however, are found in the area of the house known as the kohbar ghar, or an inner room. There, on the freshly plastered walls of the space, are magnificent depictions of kohbar, a lotus with a stalk in full bloom that has tantric and metaphorical meanings.\nArtists in Mithila dislike voids. They decorate the entire area with natural objects from the world around them, such as birds, flowers, animals, fish, snakes, the sun, and the moon. These objects frequently have symbolic meanings, such as those for love, passion, fertility, eternity, well-being, and prosperity.\n\nWomen use bamboo twigs to paint that have been attached to cotton swabs, rice straws, or fibre. In the past, they produced colours using natural materials like phalsa and Kusum flowers, bilwa leaves, kajal, turmeric, etc.\n\nPattachitra\n\nThe state of Odisha is famous for this form of folk painting. Some of the features of this form of painting are:\n\nPattachitra is a picture painted on a piece of cloth.\nThe Puri temple customs and the Shri Jagannath cult are both closely related to this style of art.\nIt is believed to have originated as early as the 12th century\nThia Badhia, which depicts the Jagannath temple, Krishna Lila, which shows Jagannath as Lord Krishna demonstrating his powers as a child, Dasabatara Patti, which shows the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu, and Panchamukhi, which shows Lord Ganesh as a five-headed deity are some of the popular themes represented through this art form. The themes, which conceptualize the significance of the paintings, are more important than anything else in the essence of the art form.\nMost of the materials used in this painting are natural substances\nIt is a structured art form with a number of guidelines. This must have a floral border around them, and the colours used must be natural.\nPaintings are executed primarily in profile with elongated eyes, as well.\nThe paintings end up depicting stark emotional expressions with great detail because of the use of such prominent solid shades.\n\nThe art form has changed and evolved over time in observable ways. The Chitrakars have painted on Tussar silk and palm leaves in addition to producing showpieces and wall hangings.\n\nKalighat Painting\nIt originated in the 19th century in West Bengal, India, in the vicinity of Kalighat Kali Temple, Kalighat, Calcutta\nThe Kalighat paintings evolved from the representation of Hindu gods, god, and other mythological figures to reflect a variety of subjects, including numerous depictions of daily life.\nPaintings of the life of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu are also quite common in this form of painting\nContemporary events like crime were also the subject of many paintings.\nAdditionally, the artists decided to depict secular themes and figures, contributing to the Independence movement in the process. Historical figures like Rani Lakshmibai and Duldul, the well-known horse of Imam Hussain of Karbala, were painted.\nThis school of painting is characterized by the use of watercolours on mill paper with brushes made of calf and squirrel hair.\n\nThese simple paintings and drawings, which could easily be reproduced by lithography influenced even modern artists like the late Jamini Roy.\n\nKalamkari\nA type of hand-painted or block-printed cotton textile known as kalamkari is made in the Iranian city of Isfahan and the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.\nOnly natural dyes are used in Kalamkari, which involves twenty-three steps\nArtists use a bamboo or date palm stick that is pointed at one end and has a bundle of fine hair attached to it as a brush or pen to draw design contours.\nThere are two distinctive styles of Kalamkari art in India \u2013 the Srikalahasti style and the Machilipatnam style.\nThis artistic movement thrived in temples that focused on forging distinctive religious identities. It can be seen on scrolls, temple hangings, chariot banners, and representations of gods and scenes from the Hindu epics (e.g. Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Purana).\nAs the first chairperson of the All India Handicrafts Board, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay popularised the art and is credited with giving the style its current status.\nWarli\nThe Warli community inhabits the west coast of Northern Maharashtra around the north Sahyadri range\nMarried women play a central role in creating their most important painting called Chowk to mark special occasions.\nChowk is dominated by the image of a mother goddess, Palghat, who is primarily worshipped as the goddess of fertility and represents the corn goddess, Kansari. She is closely associated with the rituals of marriage, fertility, harvest, and the new season of sowing.\nThe cord goddess is enclosed in a tiny square frame that is embellished on the outside with \u201cpointed\u201d chevrons that stand for Hariyali Deva, or the God of Plants.\nScenes of daily life, including hunting, fishing, farming, dancing, and animal myths are depicted around the central motif of Palaghat.\nThese paintings are traditionally painted with rice flour on the earth-coloured walls of their homes.\nThese simplistic wall paintings, which are monosyllabic in nature, use a very elementary graphic vocabulary like a circle, a triangle, and a square.\nTheir observations of nature led them to create the circle and triangle. The triangle shows mountains and conical trees, while the circle shows the sun and moon.\nModern Indian Paintings\n\nMany people believe that Indian art began to become modern around 1857. The National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi includes pieces from this era in its collection. The Impressionist movement conveniently marks the beginning of the modern era in the west. However, the Bengal School of Painting is usually where we start when discussing modern Indian art.\n\nModern or contemporary art is characterized by certain freedom from the invention, acceptance of an eclectic approach that places artistic expression in an international context as opposed to a regional one, a positive elevation of technique that has grown to be both widespread and supreme, and the emergence of the artist as a unique individual.\n\nEvolution of modern painting in India\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Indian painting as an extension of Indian miniature painting was declining. Only a few minor artistic expressions, such as the \u201cBazar\u201d and \u201cCompany\u201d styles of painting, as well as some regional folk arts, persisted during this time.\nThen emerged the recently introduced naturalism in the West, which Raja Ravi Verma was the leading proponent of.\nAbanindranath Tagore made an effort to stop this cultural muddle, and under his inspired leadership, a new school of painting that was initially distinctly nostalgic and romantic came into being. It maintained its position as the Bengal School of Painting, also known as the Renaissance School or the Revivalist School, for more than three decades.\nThe end of the Second World War unleashed unprecedented and entirely new political and cultural forces and situations that the artist had to deal with.\nSignificantly, the time frame was contiguous with the country\u2019s independence. Freedom brought with it previously unheard-of opportunities. A broad modernization and confrontational course were set for the artist, especially with the West, which had far-reaching repercussions. The artists accepted this change brought about by the circumstances and the desire for modernization (to adopt the ideas such as impressionism, expressionism, or post-expressionism in the realm of arts)\nThe fact that the technique and method have taken on new significance is one of the most distinguishing features of contemporary Indian painting. The content of a work of art became secondary to the form, which was increasingly valued as a distinct entity.\nThe lack of a genuine connection between the artist and the public has become a new issue with the rise of individualism as the dominant artistic ideology.\n\nMore on Bengal school of art\n\nThe Bengal School of Art commonly referred to as the Bengal School was an art movement and a style of Indian painting that originated in Bengal, and flourished throughout the Indian subcontinent, during the British Raj in the early 20th century.\n\nThe emergence of the Bengal school of Art:\n\nTraditional Indian painting techniques had lost favour during the British Raj, when the British crown ruled the Indian subcontinent, largely because they did not suit the tastes of British collectors.\nCompany Paintings, which catered to British sensibilities, were widely promoted in addition to the European painting techniques and subjects that were taught in art academies.\nCompany Paintings depicted Indian subjects such as native plant life or customary dress and rituals using both the European aesthetic and painting conventions.\nRather than celebrating Indian cultural traditions, it simplified them into exotica.\nBy drawing on Mughal influences, Rajasthani, and Pahari styles to present elegant scenes of uniquely Indian customs and daily life, the Bengal School emerged to combat such imagery.\n\nThe Main features of the Bengal School of Painting:\n\nBased on Indian Traditions: The Bengal School is entirely based on the Indian traditional style because it teaches subjects related to Indian culture.\nThe paintings based on Indian themes like \u2018Mahakali, \u2018Shiva Parwati\u2019Krishna and Gopis, etc. prove the Bengal School\u2019s Indian mentality.\nInfluence of Ajanta Paintings: Ajanta Art has an influence on Bengal Schools. Bengal School exhibits Ajanta Art characteristics like rhythm, grace, harmony, etc.\nLinear Delicacy: The lines of Bengal School resemble the Ajanta Paintings. Lines are delicate and rhythmic.\nSoftness and Rhythm in Figures: Bengal School\u2019s figures have a soft appearance; they lack hardness. They are delicate and graceful. These are rhythmic and give the eyes a pleasurable experience.\nBeautiful Colour Scheme: Bengal School\u2019s colours are very appealing. The Wash technique is employed, and the colours aren\u2019t at all garish or bright.\nInfluence of Mughal and Rajasthani Schools: Mughal and Rajasthani Schools\u2019 influence can also be seen in some places.\nLight and Shade: The softness in the paintings of Bengal School is due to its quality of brilliant light and shade.\n\nImpressive and Indian Subject Matter: Bengal School\u00a0is both Indian and very impressive. Themes from literature, religion, and history are all used.\n\nPrevious Year Questions UPSC Prelims\n\n1.

Read here to know more about it.\n\nLike all other aspects of society, the colonization of India also had a great impact on architecture. Colonization marked a new chapter in Indian architecture. Though the Dutch, the Portuguese, and the French made their presence felt through their buildings it was the English who had a lasting impact on the architecture of India. Colonial architecture plays an important role in making Indian history.\n\nAt the beginning of the colonial rule, there were attempts at creating authority through classical prototypes. In its later phase, the colonial architecture culminated into what is called the Indo-Saracenic architecture.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nColonial Architecture \u2013 European Influences\nPortuguese Architecture in India\nFrench architecture in India\nBritish Architecture in India\nIndo-Gothic Style/Victorian style\nNeo-Roman Design\nIndo-Saracenic movement\nColonial Architecture in the Post-Independence Era\nDifference Between Iberian and Gothic Architecture of Colonial Architecture\nMajor Colonial Architecture monuments built by various colonial empires\nSome Famous Colonial Architects of Modern India\nConclusion\nColonial Architecture \u2013 European Influences\n\nIndia has a great history of Architecture. The arrival of Europeans to India further enriched the architectural traditions of our country. It saw the synthesis of the indigenous architectural traditions of India with the European architectural styles.\n\nColonial architecture exhibited itself through institutional, civic, and utilitarian buildings such as post offices, railway stations, rest houses, and government buildings.\n\nPortuguese Architecture in India\nPortuguese established impressive churches in the Iberian style of architecture (for ex. churches of Goa. Francis Church at Cochin (1510) is believed to be the first church built by the Europeans in India.\nPortuguese used bricks as the main building material along with wooden roofs & stairs.\nMany of the early architecture of the Portuguese are manifested in churches, cathedrals, and schools. These churches were built in the Iberian style.\nWestern India, especially Goa and Daman and Diu have seen the maximum influence of Portuguese colonization.\nThey began by constructing\u00a0trading terminals and warehouses\u00a0along the coasts, which were subsequently transformed into fortified cities.\nThey also imported the notion of\u00a0\u2018patio homes\u2019\u00a0and the\u00a0\u2018Baroque style,\u2019\u00a0which were established in Europe in the late 16th century to symbolize the Church\u2019s strength.\nTo produce a dramatic impact, it featured an extensive, complex, and theatrical design. It necessitated the employment of clashing colors.\nSome of the prominent construction of this period includes:\nThe\u00a0S\u00e9 Cathedral in Goa, with its three stories and baroque style reminds one of the late Renaissance architecture, which was built in 1619 CE, and is one of the most prominent structures. It was constructed in the late Gothic Portuguese style. It contains a big bell that is known as the \u201cGolden Bell.\nBasilica of\u00a0Bom Jesus, Goa is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that was finished in 1604 in the Baroque style. It houses the relics of St. Francis Xavier.\nSt. Paul\u2019s Church in Diu was finished in 1610 and was built in the Baroque style.\nOn the shore of Diu island,\u00a0Diu Fort\u00a0was erected in 1535. There is a lighthouse on the fort\u2019s walls, as well as canons. Within the fort complex, there are three churches: St. Thomas Church, St. Paul\u2019s Church, and the Church of St. Francis of Assisi.\nTalaulim\u2019s St. Anne\u2019s Church (Goa) was created in the Baroque style and completed in 1695.\nOther famous Portuguese monuments in India include the\u00a0Bandel Church in West Bengal on the banks of the River Hooghly. In Mumbai, the Madh Fort, Castella de Aguada, and St. John\u2019s Baptist Church are structures that remain from the Portuguese colonial rule.\nFrench architecture in India\nThe Parisian architectural styles\u00a0can be seen in various places in India\nThe French architecture made use of\u00a0local raw materials and took into account the climatic conditions of the place\nFrench shutter windows, carvings on archways, and narrow street fronts were the French-style\nMonuments of this style can be seen in Puducherry, Bengal, Karaikal, Mahe etc\nFrench grid patterns, clear sectors, and perpendicular streets are the three distinct features that comprise the plan of the French towns\nSome of the noted buildings and monuments bearing French style include a statue of Joan of Arc at Dumas Street; \u2018Le Caf\u00e9\u2019; the\u00a0Mairie building that presently houses the Puducherry Municipality; the French consulate building; \u2018Le Foyer du Soldat\u2019, a legion hall for veteran soldiers.\nThe French brought with them the notion of\u00a0urban city planning.\nThe\u00a0Cartesian grid layouts\u00a0and scientific architectural designs were used to build the French colonies of Puducherry and Chandernagore (now Chandannagar, West Bengal).\nAs a display of authority, they constructed massive structures.\nThey also established the\u00a0notion of faceless architecture,\u00a0which is characterized by a basic facade devoid of embellishment or design, similar to modern structures.\nThe coastal cities of Mahe (Kerala), Karaikal (Tamil Nadu), and Yanam were also established by the French (Andhra Pradesh).\nPuducherry\u2019s Sacred Heart Church and Chandannagar\u2019s Sacred Heart Church\u00a0are two examples.\nBritish Architecture in India\nBritish followed various architectural styles viz. Gothic, Imperial, Christian, Palladian, and Victorian are prominent.\nBritishers used Red sandstone & coarse limestone as the main building material.\nThe Palladian style was sought to be introduced by a British officer in the 18th century. A famous example of a building of this style is, Constantia, which was erected by General Martin at Lucknow\nIn the 19th century, there grew a movement to combine the best elements from India and Western architecture. The pioneer of this movement was, FS Growse. The museum at Jaipur and the Moor Market in Chennai are examples of this form of architecture\nSardar Ram Singh, a master builder of Punjab, designed the Central Museum and the Senate House at Lahore (in Pakistan)\nWittet designed the Gateway of India in Mumbai, borrowing several elements of the Mughal style\nThe\u00a0Victoria Terminus station\u00a0in Mumbai is an example of Victorian Gothic revival architecture in India, deriving themes from Indian traditional architecture. It was designed by\u00a0FW Stevens\nThe\u00a0Gothic style of building was introduced by the British which\u00a0fused with Indian architecture to create the Indo-Gothic architectural style.\nAfter 1911, a new architectural style called Neo-Roman architecture\u00a0evolved.\nINDO-GOTHIC STYLE/VICTORIAN STYLE\nIt is also known as the\u00a0Victorian style;\u00a0it was a unique combination of Indian, Persian, and Gothic architectural elements.\nThe following are some of the characteristics of the Indo-Gothic style:\nThe structures were extraordinarily huge and intricately constructed.\nThe\u00a0arches were pointed,\u00a0unlike the curved arches of the Indo-Islamic era.\nOne of the distinguishing elements of the Victorian design was the use of\u00a0wide windows.\nIt followed sophisticated structural engineering requirements in Britain and featured a crucified ground design.\nSteel, iron, and poured concrete became popular.\nVictoria Memorial in Kolkata, Gateway of India in Mumbai, and so on are some examples.\nNEO-ROMAN DESIGN\nFollowing World War I, the British Raj built in the\u00a0Neo-Roman or Neo-Classical styles.\nThe best examples of this style were the buildings of New Delhi, designed by\u00a0Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker.\nIt is commonly referred to as the \u201cRome of Hindustan.\u201d\nThis phase contains the following characteristics:\nThe structures were unremarkable and without any distinguishing traits.\nIt was a mash-up of all architectural styles, resulting in a style that was crowded and limited the area for creative expression.\nBecause of the composite character of the buildings, simplicity, modernism, and usability were severely harmed.\nA special emphasis was placed on\u00a0circular structures.\nThe usage of Eastern themes to realize Western architectural styles was overdone.\nDuring this time, the notion of an\u00a0upturned dome\u00a0was developed, as seen on the top of the\u00a0Supreme Court and Rashtrapati Bhavan.\n\nRead: Gothic Architecture\u200b\u200b\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIndo-Saracenic movement\n\nAt the end of the Victorian era, India entered the era of national awakening and movement. The architecture represented the character of the time, a combination of imperial and national urges. It was this urge that led to the movement of Indo-Saracenic. This movement drew elements from the indigenous and Indo-Islamic architecture and combined it with the Gothic revival and Neo-classical styles favored in Victorian England.\n\nSalient features of this form of architectural style are:\n\nBulbous domes:\n\nThis is one of the most characteristic features of Indo-Saracenic buildings\nThe Bulbous dome is a hemispherical structure that evolved from an arch, usually forming a ceiling or roof.\nThe Dome is considered a symbolic representation of the Vault of heaven\nSome of the examples with Bulbous Domes are Egmore Railway Station, Chennai Museum\n\nOverhanging eaves (Chhajja):\n\nIt is a protruding structure which protects the lower walls\nThis feature was common in Mughal architecture. Ex: Tomb of Salim Chishti, Fatepur Sikri, India\nThis feature became part of the Indo-Saracenic architecture during the 19th\u00a0and 20th\u00a0Ex: Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Rashtrapati Bhavan\n\nVaulted roof:\n\nVaulted Roofs are ceilings with intersecting arches.\nThese roofs can be seen in the mausoleum which was built during the Islamic period.\nHowever, this feature was adopted by the British into the monuments they built during their time in Ex: St.Matthias\u2019 Church, Chennai.\n\nChhatris:\n\nChhatris are an elevated, dome-shaped pavilions used as an element in Indian architecture.\nThe word chhatri also refer to the small pavilions that mark the corners, and roof or entrance of a major building\nThese pavilions are purely decorative and have no utility, but they are a classic folly that represents status and wealth. Ex: Tomb of Humayun\nThis feature can also be found in the Indo-Saracenic style. Ex: Rashtrapati Bhavan.\n\nMinarets:\n\nIt is a tall spire with a conical or onion-shaped crown.\nMinarets are either free-standing or taller than the associated support\nThe basic form of a minaret includes a base, shaft, and gallery\nIn Chennai, the Senate house is the best example of Indo-Saracenic architecture with Minarets.\n\nPavilion:\n\nA pavilion refers to a subsidiary building that is positioned separately or as an attachment to a main building.\nPalaces or other large houses may have one or more subsidiary pavilions that are either freestanding or connected by covered walkways in the buildings of Mughal architecture.\nThese pavilions can be found in the forts and palaces of British architecture in Indo-Saracenic style.\n\nCusped arches:\n\nThe cusp in architecture is the intersections of lobed or scalloped forms, particularly in arches (cusped arches) and tracery (ornamental stonework)\nThe monumental cusped arch had become the standard Mughal-style component by the end of the 17th Century\nThe British builders also used the cusped-shaped arch universally and frequently enriched it with representations of leaves, flowers, or even human heads at the tip. Ex: Chennai corporation building, Rashtrapati Bhavan, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus\nColonial Architecture in the Post-Independence Era\nFollowing 1947, two architectural schools emerged:\u00a0Revivalist and Modernist.\nBoth schools, however, were unable to shake the colonial hangover. As a result, the quality of India\u2019s architectural traditions has deteriorated.\nFor example,\u00a0the Punjab government commissioned a French architect,\u00a0Le Corbusier, to construct Chandigarh.\nDifference Between Iberian and Gothic Architecture of Colonial Architecture\nBasis\n\t\nIberian Architecture\n\t\nGothic Architecture\n\n\nMaterial Used\n\t\nThe Portuguese employed brick as their primary building material. Roofs and stairwells were made of wood.\n\t\nThe most common materials utilized were red sandstone and coarse limestone.\n\n\nStructural Variations\n\t\nThe Portuguese maintained their Western customs and did not make any structural changes.\n\t\nThe Indo-Gothic style of architecture arose from the British adoption of Indian elements and forms.\nMajor Colonial Architecture monuments built by various colonial empires\n\nVictoria Terminus Station (Chhatrapati Shivaji station), Mumbai\n\nDesigned by the British architect F. W.

His father worked in Kumbakonam as a clerk in a cloth merchant\u2019s shop.\n\nWhen he was nearly five years old, Ramanujan entered the primary school in Kumbakonam although he would attend several different primary schools before entering the Town High School in Kumbakonam in January 1898.\n\nBefore turning 10, he passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography, and arithmetic with the best scores in the district. That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.\n\nBy age 11 he was recognized as a child prodigy as he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students who were lodgers at his home.\n\nBy age 13, he mastered advanced trigonometry and by age 14 he had started showing affinity to geometry and infinite series.\n\nRamanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902. He would later develop his method to solve the quartic. In 1903, he tried to solve the quintic, not knowing that it was impossible to solve with radicals.\n\nHe received a scholarship to study at Government Arts College, Kumbakonam. Still, he was so intent on mathematics that he could not focus on any other subjects and failed most of them, losing his scholarship in the process.\n\nHe then ran away from his house to Vishakapatnam where he continued his mathematical work, however, and at this time he worked on hypergeometric series and investigated relations between integrals and series. He was to discover later that he had been studying elliptic functions.\n\nIn 1906 Ramanujan went to Madras where he entered Pachaiyappa\u2019s College. He aimed to pass the First Arts examination which would allow him to be admitted to the University of Madras. He attended lectures at Pachaiyappa\u2019s College but became ill after three months of study. He took the First Arts examination after having left the course.\n\nHe passed mathematics but failed all his other subjects and therefore failed the examination. This meant that he could not enter the University of Madras.\nIn the following years, he worked on mathematics developing his ideas without any help and without any real idea of the then-current research topics other than that provided by Carr\u2019s book.\n\nHe became seriously ill again and underwent an operation in April 1909 after which it took him some considerable time to recover.\n\nHe married on 14 July 1909 when his mother arranged for him to marry a ten-year-old girl S Janaki Ammal.\n\nThe mathematical journey of Srinivasa Ramanujan\n\nContinuing his mathematical work Ramanujan studied continued fractions and divergent series in 1908.\n\nRamanujan continued to develop his mathematical ideas and began to pose problems and solve problems in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.\n\nHe developed relations between elliptic modular equations in 1910.\nAfter the publication of a brilliant research paper on Bernoulli numbers in 1911 in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society he gained recognition for his work.\n\nDespite his lack of a university education, he was becoming well known in the Madras area as a mathematical genius.\n\nRamanujan was able to get a job as a clerk in the madras post trust on the recommendation of EW Middlemast, a professor of mathematics in the Presidency college madras.\n\nIn January 1913 Ramanujan wrote to G H Hardy having seen a copy of his 1910 book Orders of infinity.\n\nHardy and Littlewood were very impressed by Ramanujan\u2019s work and helped him get a scholarship at the University of Madras in 1913.\n\nIn 1914, Hardy brought Ramanujan to Trinity College, Cambridge to begin an extraordinary collaboration.\n\nLife in Cambridge, England\n\nRight from the beginning, he had problems with his diet. The outbreak of World War I made obtaining special items of food (as he was a strict vegetarian) harder and it was not long before Ramanujan had health problems.\n\nRamanujan\u2019s collaboration with Hardy led to important results. But his lack of formal education did cause some problems, hence Littlewood was asked to help teach Ramanujan rigorous mathematical methods.\n\nHowever, Hardy said- \u201cit was extremely difficult because every time some matter, which it was thought that Ramanujan needed to know, was mentioned, Ramanujan\u2019s response was an avalanche of original ideas which made it almost impossible for Littlewood to persist in his original intention.\u201d\n\nOn 16 March 1916 Srinivasa Ramanujan graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts in Research (the degree was called a Ph.D. from 1920).\n\nHe had been allowed to enroll in June 1914 despite not having the proper qualifications.\nRamanujan\u2019s dissertation was on Highly composite numbers and consisted of seven of his papers published in England.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1918, he fell seriously ill and spent most of his time in various nursing homes.\n\nOn 18 February 1918 Ramanujan was elected a fellow of the Cambridge Philosophical Society and then three days later, the greatest honor that he would receive, his name appeared on the list for election as a fellow of the Royal Society of London.\n\nHe had been proposed by an impressive list of mathematicians, namely Hardy, MacMahon, Grace, Larmor, Bromwich, Hobson, Baker, Littlewood, Nicholson, Young, Whittaker, Forsyth, and Whitehead.\nHis election as a fellow of the Royal Society was confirmed on 2 May 1918, then on 10 October 1918, he was elected a Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge, the fellowship to run for six years.\n\nHe returned to India in 1919.\n\nHe died in 1920 at the age of 32 due to ill health.\n\nRamanujan\u2019s work in mathematics\n\nThe letters Ramanujan wrote to Hardy in 1913 contained many fascinating results.\n\nRamanujan worked out the Riemann series, the elliptic integrals, the hypergeometric series, and the functional equations of the zeta function.\nOn the other hand, he had only a vague idea of what constitutes mathematical proof.\nDespite many brilliant results, some of his theorems on prime numbers were completely wrong.\n\nRamanujan independently discovered the results of Gauss, Kummer, and others on hypergeometric series. Ramanujan\u2019s work on partial sums and products of hypergeometric series has led to a major development in the topic.\n\nRamanujan left several unpublished notebooks filled with theorems that mathematicians have continued to study.\n\nG N Watson, Mason Professor of Pure Mathematics at Birmingham from 1918 to 1951 published 14 papers under the general title Theorems stated by Ramanujan, and in all, he published nearly 30 papers that were inspired by Ramanujan\u2019s work.\n\nHardy passed on to Watson a large number of manuscripts of Ramanujan that he had, both written before 1914 and some written in Ramanujan\u2019s last year in India before his death.\n\nThe number 1729 is known as the Hardy\u2013Ramanujan number after a famous visit by Hardy to see Ramanujan at a hospital.\n\nIn Ramanujan\u2019s words, \u201cIt is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.\u201d\n\nIn his obituary of Ramanujan, written for Nature in 1920, Hardy observed that Ramanujan\u2019s work primarily involved fields less known even among other pure mathematicians.\n\nLegacy of Srinivasa Ramanujan\n\nThe year after his death, Nature listed Ramanujan among other distinguished scientists and mathematicians on a \u201cCalendar of Scientific Pioneers\u201d who had achieved eminence.\n\nRamanujan\u2019s home state of Tamil Nadu celebrates 22 December (Ramanujan\u2019s birthday) as \u2018State IT Day\u2019.\n\nStamps picturing Ramanujan were issued by the government of India in 1962, 2011, 2012, and 2016.\n\nIn 2012, former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh paid tribute to the mathematician during a ceremony in Chennai to commemorate Ramanujan\u2019s birth anniversary and declared December 22 National Mathematics Day.\n\nThe Ramanujan Math Park located in Kuppam, Andhra Pradesh, was inaugurated on this day in 2017.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

These texts throw invaluable light on the social and economic conditions of that era. They also make references to political events in the age of the Buddha.\nJaina\u2019s religious text: The Jaina texts commonly called\u00a0\u201cangas\u201d, were written in the Prakrit language, and contain philosophical concepts of the Jainas.\u00a0They contain many texts which help to reconstruct the political history of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the age of Mahavira.

(epigraphy \u2013 study of inscriptions). They usually record the achievements, activities and ideas of those who got them inscribed. Those inscriptions which are composed by poets in praise of kings and patrons are known as prashastis.\nThe earliest inscriptions were in Prakrit, a name for a language used by ordinary people. In later times, Tamil and Sanskrit were also used to write inscriptions.\nThe Mauryan king Ashoka was the first person to issue inscriptions. Most of his inscriptions are in Prakrit language written in the Brahmi script though, some in the northwest, were written in Kharosthi. And Aramaic and Greek scripts were used for inscriptions in Afghanistan.\nCOINS\nThe ancient Indian currency was not issued in the form of paper but as coins. were mostly minted in metals such as copper, silver, gold and lead. (Numismatics- study of coins)\nThe earliest coins found in India contained only a few symbols, punch-marked coins made of silver & copper, but later coins mentioned the names of the kings, gods, dates, etc.\nCoins throw light on the economic history of different dynasties and also provide input on different parameters involved such as the script, art, and religion of that time.\nARCHAEOLOGY\nArchaeology is a science that enables us to systematically dig the successive layers of old mounds and to form an idea of the material life of the people of the past on the basis of remains found there.\nArchaeological studies help in the period before the invention of writing. In the proto-historic phase, Harappans knew how to write but historians have not been able to read it. The first script to be deciphered was Brahmi which was used in the Ashokan inscriptions and belongs to the third century BC.\nIn south India, some people were buried along with their tools, weapons, pottery and other belongings under big and heavy stones. These graves are known as megaliths. Their dates are fixed according to radiocarbon dating.\nFOREIGN ACCOUNTS\nIndigenous literature can be supplemented. To India came the Greek, Chinese and Roman visitors, either as travellers or religious converts, and left behind a rich account of our historical past.\nSome of the notables among them were:\nGreek Ambassador Megasthenes wrote \u201cIndica\u201d and provided valuable information about the Mauryan society and administration.\n\u201cThe Periplus of the Erythrean Sea\u201d and \u201cPtolemy\u2019s Geography\u201d both written in Greek give valuable information about the ports and commodities of trade between India and the Roman empire.\nFa-Hein Faxien (337 CE \u2013 422 CE), a Buddhist traveller, left a vivid account of the age of the Guptas.\nHsuan-Tsang, a Buddhist pilgrim, visited India and gave details of India under the reign of King Harshavardhana and the glory of the Nalanda University.\nPre-historic India: Periods\n\nPre-historic India (Ancient history) can be divided into different periods according to the tools used by people then.\n\nPalaeolithic Period (Old Stone Age): 500,000 BCE \u2013 10,000 BCE\nMesolithic Period (Late Stone Age): 10,000 BCE \u2013 6000 BCE\nNeolithic Period (New Stone Age): 6000 BCE \u2013 1000 BCE\nChalcolithic Period (Stone Copper Age): 3000 BCE \u2013 500 BCE\nIron Age: 1500 BCE \u2013 200 BCE\n\nStone Age\n\nThe primary source of knowledge for the stone age is archaeological investigations because it belongs to the pre-historic India (era), or the time before the invention of writing. The Pallavaram hand axe was discovered by archaeologist Robert Bruce Foote as the country of India\u2019s first Palaeolithic tool.\n\nOn the basis of geological age, the type and technology of stone tools, and subsistence base, the\u00a0Indian stone age is classified primarily into three types-\n\nPalaeolithic age (old stone age): Period \u2013 500,000 \u2013 10,000 BCE\nMesolithic age (late stone age): Period \u2013 10,000 \u2013 6000 BCE\nNeolithic age (new stone age): Period \u2013 6000 \u2013 1000 BCE\n\n\u00a0\n\nPre-historic India: Palaeolithic Age (Old Stone Age)\n\nThe word \u201cPalaeolithic\u201d is a combination of the Greek words \u201cpalaeo\u201d for old and \u201clithic\u201d for stone. Consequently, the phrase \u201cPalaeolithic age\u201d refers to the pre-historic India stone period.\n\nThe Pleistocene epoch, often known as the Ice Age, is a geological era during which the globe was covered in ice and the climate was so cold that neither human life nor plant life could thrive.\n\nDuring this time, India\u2019s old stone age or Palaeolithic culture emerged. The earliest species of men, however, could have lived in a tropical area where ice had melted.\n\nMain characteristics of the Palaeolithic age\u00a0\u2013\nThe Indian people are believed to have belonged to the\u00a0\u2018Negrito\u2019 race,\u00a0and lived in the open air, river valleys, caves and rock shelters.\nThey were\u00a0food gatherers, ate wild fruits and vegetables, and lived on hunting.\nThere was no knowledge of houses, pottery, or agriculture. It was only in later stages they discovered fire.\nIn the upper Palaeolithic age, there is evidence of art in the form of paintings.\nHumans used unpolished, rough stones like hand axes, choppers, blades, burins and scrapers.\n\nPalaeolithic men are also called\u00a0\u2018Quartzite\u2019 men\u00a0in India as the stone tools were made of a hard rock called quartzite.\n\nThe old stone age or Palaeolithic age in India is divided into three phases according to the nature of the stone tools used by the people and also according to the nature of the change of climate.\n\nLower Palaeolithic Age: up to 100,000 BC\nMiddle Palaeolithic Age: 100,000 BC \u2013 40,000 BC\nUpper Palaeolithic Age: 40,000 BC \u2013 10,000 BC\nLOWER PALAEOLITHIC AGE (EARLY PALAEOLITHIC AGE)\nIt covers the greater part of the Ice Age.\nHunters and food gatherers; tools used were hand axes, choppers and cleavers. Tools were rough and heavy.\nOne of the earliest lower Palaeolithic sites is Bori in Maharashtra.\nLimestone was also used to make tools.\nMajor sites of the lower Palaeolithic age\nSoan valley (in present Pakistan)\nSites in the Thar Desert\nKashmir\nMewar plains\nSaurashtra\nGujarat\nCentral India\nDeccan Plateau\nChotanagpur plateau\nNorth of the Cauvery River\nBelan valley in UP\nThere are habitation sites including caves and rock shelters.\nAn important place is Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh.\n\u00a0MIDDLE PALAEOLITHIC AGE\nTools used were flakes, blades, pointers, scrapers and borers.\nThe tools were smaller, lighter and thinner.\nThere was a decrease in the use of hand axes with respect to other tools.\nImportant middle Palaeolithic age sites\nBelan valley in UP\nLuni valley (Rajasthan)\nSon and Narmada rivers\nBhimbetka\nTungabhadra river valleys\nPotwar Plateau (between Indus & Jhelum)\nSanghao cave (near Peshawar, Pakistan)\nUPPER PALAEOLITHIC AGE\nThe upper Palaeolithic age\u00a0coincided with the last phase of the ice age\u00a0when the climate became comparatively warmer and less humid.\nThe emergence of Homo sapiens.\nThe period is marked by innovation in tools and technology.\u00a0A lot of bone tools, including needles, harpoons, parallel-sided blades, fishing tools and burin tools.\nMajor sites of the Upper Palaeolithic age\nBhimbetka (South of Bhopal) \u2013\u00a0hand axes and cleavers, blades, scrapers and a few burins have been found here.\nBelan\nSon\nChota Nagpur plateau (Bihar)\nMaharashtra\nOrissa and\nThe Eastern Ghats in Andhra Pradesh\nBone tools have been found only at the cave sites of Kurnool and Muchchatla Chintamani Gavi in Andhra Pradesh.\nPre-historic India: Mesolithic Period (Middle Stone Age)\n\n\nGreek terms for \u201cmeso\u201d and \u201clithic,\u201d respectively, are the source of the phrase \u201cmesolithic.\u201d Meso means in the centre and lithic meaning stone in Greek. The Mesolithic period of prehistory is thus also referred to as the \u201cMiddle Stone Age.\u201d\n\nThe Mesolithic and Neolithic periods are both considered to be Holocene in age. A rise in temperature and a warming of the environment during this time period caused the ice to melt and brought about changes in the flora and fauna.\n\nCharacteristic Features of the Mesolithic Era\nThe people of this era believed in life after death and hence they buried the dead with food items and other goods.\nThe first animal to be domesticated was the wild ancestor of the dog. Sheep and goats were the most common domesticated animals.\nThe first human colonization of the Ganga Plains happened during this period.\nThe Mesolithic men started to wear clothes made of animal skin.\nThe people of this age\u00a0lived on hunting, fishing and food gathering initially but later on they also\u00a0domesticated animals and cultivated plants, thereby paving the way for agriculture.\nThe Mesolithic people lived in semi-permanent settlements occupying caves and open grounds.\nThe characteristic tools of this era were\u00a0microliths\u2013 the miniature stone tools usually made of crypto-crystalline silica, chalcedony or chert, both of geometrical and non-geometrical shapes. They were not only used as tools but were also used to make composite tools, spearheads, arrowheads, and sickles after hafting them on wooden or bone handles. These microliths enabled Mesolithic man to hunt smaller animals and birds.\nThe Mesolithic people were art lovers and initiated rock art. The subject matter of these paintings was mostly wild animals and hunting scenes, dancing and food collection were also depicted in such paintings. These rock paintings give an idea about the development of religious practices and also reflect the division of labour on the basis of gender.\nImportant Mesolithic Sites\nBagor in Rajasthan\u00a0is one of the biggest and best-documented Mesolithic sites in India. Bagor is\u00a0on river Kothari where microliths along with animal bones and shells have been excavated.\nAdamgarh in Madhya Pradesh\u00a0provides the earliest evidence for the domestication of animals.\nThere are about 150 Mesolithic rock art sites across India, with a rich concentration in Central\u00a0India such as Bhimbetka caves (Madhya Pradesh), Kharwar, Jaora and Kathotia (M.P), Sundargarh and Sambalpur (Odisha), Ezhuthu Guha (Kerala).\nMicroliths have also been found in some valleys of rivers Tapi, Sabarmati, Narmada, and Mahi.\nLanghnaj in Gujarat and Biharanpur in West Bengal are also important Mesolithic sites. Bones of\u00a0wild animals (rhinoceros, blackbuck, etc.) have been excavated from Langhnaj. Several human skeletons and a large number of microliths have been recovered from these places.\nThough pottery is absent at most Mesolithic sites, they have been found in Langhnaj (Gujarat) and in the Kaimur region of Mirzapur (U.P).\nPre-historic India: Neolithic Period (New Stone Age)\n\n\nNeolithic is a name that comes from the Greek words \u201cneo\u201d for new and \u201clithic\u201d for stone. As a result, the phrase \u201cNeolithic Age\u201d designates the \u201cNew Stone Age.\u201d Since it brought about numerous significant changes in man\u2019s social and economic existence, it is also known as the \u201cNeolithic revolution.\u201d In the Neolithic period, man transitioned from being a food gatherer to a food producer.\n\nCharacteristic Features of the Neolithic Age\nAgriculture\u00a0\u2013 The people of the Neolithic age\u00a0cultivated land and grew fruits and corn like ragi and\u00a0horse gram (kulati). They also domesticated cattle, sheep and goats.\nPottery\u00a0\u2013 With the advent of agriculture, people were required to store their food grains as well as to cook, eat the product, etc. That\u2019s why it is said that pottery appeared in this phase on a large scale. The pottery of this period was classified under grey ware, black-burnished ware, and mat-impressed ware. In the initial stages of the Neolithic age, handmade pottery was made but later on, foot wheels were used to make pots.\nTools and Weapons\u2013 The people used\u00a0microlithic blades in addition to tools made of polished\u00a0stones. The use of celts was especially important for ground and polished hand axes. They also used tools and weapons made of bones \u2013 such as needles, scrapers, borers, arrowheads, etc. The use of new polished tools made it easier for humans to cultivate, hunt and perform other activities in a better manner.\nHousing and Settled Life\u2013 The people of the Neolithic age lived in rectangular or circular houses which were made of mud and reeds. Neolithic men also knew how to make boats and could spin cotton, wool and weave cloth. The people of the Neolithic age led a more settled life and paved the way for the beginning of civilization.\n\nThe neolithic people did not live far away from the hilly areas. They inhabited mainly the hilly river valleys, rock shelters and the slopes of the hills since they were entirely dependent on weapons and tools made of stone.\n\nImportant Neolithic Sites\nBelan Valley\u00a0(which is located on the northern spurs of the Vindhyas and middle part of Narmada valley) \u2013 All three phases i.e., palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic ages are found in the sequence.\nBurzahom (Kashmir)\u2013 The domestic dogs were buried along with their masters in their graves; people lived in pits and used tools made of polished stones as well as bones.\nGufkral (Kashmir)\u00a0\u2013 This neolithic site is famous for pit dwellings, stone tools and graveyards in houses.\nKoldihwa and Mahagara (lying south of Allahabad) \u2013This site provides evidence of circular huts along with crude handmade pottery. There is also evidence of rice, which is the oldest evidence of rice, not only in India but anywhere in the world.\nMehrgarh (Balochistan, Pakistan) \u2013The earliest Neolithic site, where people lived in houses built of sun-dried bricks and cultivated crops like cotton and wheat.\nChirand (Bihar)\u2013 The neolithic men used tools and weapons made of bones.\nPiklihal, Brahmagiri, Maski, Takkalakota, Hallur (Karnataka) \u2013The people were cattle herders. They domesticated sheep and goats. Ash mounds have been found.\nPre-historic India: Chalcolithic Age (Stone Copper Age)\n\n\nStone and metal tools began to be used together for the first time during the Chalcolithic Age. Copper was the first metal utilised. The Chalcolithic period was generally considered to be the pre-Harappan period, but it actually began in many areas of the country after the bronze Harappan culture.\n\nCharacteristics of the Chalcolithic Age\nArt and Craft\u2013 The chalcolithic people were expert coppersmiths. They knew the art of copper smelting and were good stone workers as well. They knew spinning and weaving and were well acquainted with the art of manufacturing cloth. However, they did not know the art of writing.\nWorship\u2013 Small clay images of earth goddesses have been found in the chalcolithic sites. It is thus possible to say that they venerated the Mother Goddess. In Malwa and Rajasthan, stylised bull terracottas show that the bull served as a religious cult.\nPottery\u2013 The people of the stone-copper phase used different types of pottery, one of which is called black and red pottery and seems to have been widely prevalent in that era. The ochre-coloured pottery was also popular. The potter\u2019s wheel was used and painting with white linear designs was also done.\nRural settlements \u2013\u00a0The people living in the stone age were characterised by rural settlements and were not acquainted with burnt bricks. They lived in thatched houses made of mud bricks. This age also marked the beginning of social inequalities, as chiefs lived in rectangular houses while the commoners lived in round huts. Their villages consisted of more than 35 houses of different sizes, circular or rectangular in shape. The chalcolithic economy is considered a village economy.\nAgriculture & cattle rearing\u2013 The people living in the stone-copper age domesticated animals and cultivated food grains. They domesticated cows, sheep, goats, pig and buffaloes and hunted deer. It is not clear whether they were acquainted with the horse or not. People ate beef but did not take pork on any considerable scale. The people of the Chalcolithic phase produced wheat and rice, they also cultivated bajra. They also produced several pulses such as lentils (Masur), black gram, green gram, and grass peas. Cotton was produced in the black cotton soil of the Deccan and ragi, bajra and several millets were cultivated in the lower Deccan. The people belonging to the stone-copper phase in the eastern regions lived mainly on fish and rice, which is still a popular diet in that part of the country.\nInfant mortality\u00a0\u2013\u00a0 Infant mortality was high among the Chalcolithic people, as is evident from\u00a0the\u00a0burial of a large number of children in West Maharashtra.\u00a0In spite of being a food-producing economy, the rate of infant mortality was very high. We can say that the\u00a0Chalcolithic social and economic pattern did not promote longevity.\nJewellery\u00a0\u2013 The Chalcolithic people were\u00a0fond of ornaments and decoration.\u00a0The women wore ornaments of shell and bone and carried finely worked combs in their hair. They manufactured beads of semi-precious stones such as carnelian, steatite, and quartz crystal.\nImportant Chalcolithic Sites\nMalwa (Madhya Pradesh)\u00a0\u2013 The settlements of Malwa culture are mostly located on the\u00a0Narmada and its tributaries. It provides evidence of the richest chalcolithic ceramics, and also spindle whorls.\nKayatha (Madya Pradesh) \u2013The settlement of Kayatha culture was mostly located on the\u00a0Chambal River and its tributaries. Houses had mud-plastered floors, pre-Harappan elements in pottery along with copper objects with sharp cutting edges were found.\nAhar (Banas valley, South Eastern Rajasthan)\u00a0\u2013 The people of this region practised smelting and metallurgy, and supplied copper tools to other contemporary communities. Rice was cultivated here.\nGilund (Banas valley, Rajasthan)\u00a0\u2013 Stone blade industry was discovered here.\nDaimabad\u00a0(Ahmednagar, Maharashtra)\u00a0\u2013 The largest Jorwe culture site in Godavari valley. It is famous for the recovery of bronze goods such as bronze rhinoceros, elephants, two-wheeled chariots with a rider and buffalo.\nSongaon, Inamgaon and Nasik (Maharashtra)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Large mud houses with ovens and circular pit\u00a0houses have been discovered here.\nNavdatoli (on Narmada)\u00a0\u2013 It was one of the largest chalcolithic settlements in the country. It was\u00a0spread over 10 hectares and cultivated almost all food grains.\nNevasa (Jorwe, Maharashtra) and Eran (Madhya Pradesh)\u00a0\u2013 These sites are known for their non-Harappan culture.\nChirand, Senuar, Sonpur (Bihar), Mahishdal (West Bengal) \u2013These are the prominent\u00a0chalcolithic sites in these states.\n\nAlso, to read the evolution of paintings from the pre-historic Indian period to the present age click here.\n\nSince his appearance in the Pre-historic Indian period, humans have passed through many stages of cultural growth.\n\nArchaeological sources show his existence and subsistence pattern at various sites in different parts of the subcontinent.\n\nHe was a hunter-gatherer in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods.

The chaitya and viharas make up the majority of the excavations from this era. They were primarily made of wood.\n\nThere are still surviving examples of early Buddhist architecture in Karla, Kanheri, Nasik, Bhaja, and Bedsa, as well as in Ajanta.\n\nBeginning in the fifth century AD, rock-cut architecture underwent its second phase.\n\nThis stage was distinguished by the removal of wood and the addition of the Buddha image as the main focus of the architectural scheme.\n\nDuring this time, viharas underwent a small change; the inner cells, which had previously only housed the monks, now also contained the Buddha\u2019s image.\n\nThe Dravidian rock-cut style is the following and possibly most influential stage in the rock-cut architecture tradition.\n\nMandapa and ratha are this style\u2019s defining characteristics. An open pavilion made of rock is called a mandapa.\n\nIt resembles a straightforward columned hall with two or more cells built into the back wall. A monolithic shrine made out of a single rock is called the ratha.\n\nImportant Rock Caves\n\nA few Rock cut architecture (caves) and features have been given below. These are important from the exam point of view.\n\nKanheri caves\nThey are located near Mumbai\nThey span the years from the second to the ninth centuries AD.\nThey are from the Hinayana period of Buddhist building design.\nHowever, additions were made when Mahayana Buddhism was gaining ground. Ex: the 5th-century image of Buddha\nIt has around 100 caves.\nJogeshwari caves\nThese caves are located on the island of Salsette\nThey are the culmination of Mahayana Buddhism.\nThere are also Brahmanical shrines here.\nThey belong to the second half of the 8th century\nMontpelier\nIt is also called Mandapeswar caves.

Cave 15 of Ellora is known as Dashavatara cave.\nIt dates from the reign of Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta king. Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu are primarily represented in this cave in various forms. This two-story building has a sizable courtyard where a monolithic Nandi mandapa is located.\nThe \u201cVishvakarma cave,\u201d a chaitya worship centre constructed around 650 CE, is Cave 10, which stands out among the Buddhist caves. Because the rock has been given a finish that resembles wooden beams, it is also known as the \u201cCarpenter\u2019s Cave.\u201d\nThe five Jain caves of the Digambara sect, which were discovered at Ellora\u2019s northernmost tip and discovered during the ninth and early tenth centuries, are located there.\nA monolithic shrine can be found in the court of the two-story Indra Sabha (Cave 32), which was unearthed in the ninth century.\nThe Jain Yakshas were mistaken for different representations of Indra that could be found in Buddhist and Hindu artworks in the 19th century, leading to the erroneous name \u201cIndra Sabha\u201d for the temple.\nAjanta caves\nThe caves, which are a part of the Deccan Traps formed by numerous volcanic eruptions at the end of the Cretaceous geological period, are carved out of flood basalt rock of a cliff.\nThey are a collection of rock-cut caves along the Waghora River in Maharashtra\u2019s Sahyadri Mountains, not far from Aurangabad.\nThere are 29 caves altogether. These caves are all owned by the Buddhist faith.\nThe caves were developed in the period between 200 BCE to 650 CE. Vakatakas kings provided funding for the construction of the caves.\nThe Chinese travellers\u2019 Fa Hien and Hieun Tsang made observations that made mention of these caves.\nThe earliest group consists of caves 9, 10, 12, 13, and 15A. The murals in these caves depict stories from the Jataka\nIn the fifth century, work on the Ajanta Caves site\u2019s second phase of construction started. The theistic Mahayana is credited with initiating the second phase.\nElephanta caves\nIt is located in Mumbai. They belong to the 8th century AD\nOne of the earliest examples of a Brahmanical temple, the Ganesh Gumpha was excavated on a rock terrace. Its exterior features a columned verandah and steps flanked by carved elephants.\nOne of the masterpieces of this cave is the three faced-image of Shiva\nOther noteworthy sculptures in this location include those of Ravana shaking Kailasa, Shiva and Parvati getting married, Shiva performing the Tandava dance, and Ardhanariswara.\nUdaygiri caves\nThese caves are located in MP\nThey include some of India\u2019s oldest still-standing Hindu temples and iconography.\nThey are the only location whose inscriptions can be used to confirm a monarch from the Gupta era.\nThe iconography of Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaktism (Durga and Matrikas), and Shaivism can be found in the Udayagiri caves (Shiva)\nThey are famous for the ancient monumental relief sculpture of Vishnu, who is depicted as the man-boar Varaha in Hindu mythology, saving the earth while Bhudevi is holding on to the boar\u2019s tusk.\nThe site contains significant Gupta dynasty inscriptions from Kumaragupta I and Chandragupta II, who both ruled between 375 and 415.\nTwenty caves make up the Udayagiri Caves complex, of which one is devoted to Jainism and the others to Hinduism.\nThe contribution of Pallavas\n\nNo other empire has possibly received as much praise for its contribution to rock-cut architecture as the Pallavas.\n\nBecause of their beauty and the artists\u2019 talent, some of the monuments built by the Pallavas during their rule have won praise from people all over the world.\n\nBetween the 6th and 9th centuries AD, the powerful ancient dynasty known as the Pallavas, which had Kanchipuram as its capital, ruled over a sizable portion of Southern India, including what is now Tamil Nadu.\n\nThey are recognized for having popularised the Dravidian style of temple construction. Rock-cut architecture (cave) temples were the original Pallava shrines.\n\nThese gradually developed into monolithic shrines hewn from enormous rocks, and ultimately culminated in \u201cstructural temples\u201d constructed from the ground up.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTheir contribution to the realm of rock-cut architecture could be seen in Mahabalipuram. Some of these are highlighted below:\n\nThere are numerous rock-cut shrines, which are made up of verandahs or mandapas that resemble caves and have rows of pillars.\nAs is typical of almost all Pallava architecture, the bases of the majority of the pillars are decorated with carved lions.\nHindu mythology is depicted in great detail on the panels, and sculpted gods are frequently housed in niches inside the caves. Beautiful carvings depicting Varaha, Lord Vishnu\u2019s boar-like avatar, are found on the Varaha Mandapa in Mahabalipuram.\nThe Trimurti Mandapa honours the trinity of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, while the Mahishamardini Mandapa honours Mahishamardini, a manifestation of Goddess Durga.\nThe Govardhanadhari panel, which depicts Lord Krishna supporting the fabled Govardhana hill to shield the inhabitants of his village from torrential rains, is a masterpiece found in the Krishna Mandapa.\n\nTo learn more about Pallava architecture click here\n\nArticle Written by Remya"

Puppetry has been infused with other artistic mediums, including painting, sculpture, music, dance, and theatre, creating a distinctive form of artistic expression.\n\nHowever, this creative genre has been steadily diminishing in recent years because of a lack of devoted fans and financial uncertainties.\n\nClassification of Indian puppetry\n\nPuppetry in India can be classified into four categories:\n\n1. String Puppet\n\nKundhei\nKathputli\nBommalattam\nGombeyatta\n\n2. Shadow Puppet\n\nTogalu Gombeyatta\nRavanachhaya\nTholu Bommalatta\n\n3. Rod Puppet\n\nYampuri\nPutul Nachh\n\n4. Glove Puppet\n\nPavakoothu\nString Puppetry\n\nIn Indian culture, string puppets are also referred to as marionettes.\n\nThe puppets are typically chiselled wooden replicas that are eight to nine inches long.\n\nOil paint is used to colour the wood and add other facial features such as eyes, mouth, nose, and other facial traits.\n\nLittle wooden pipes are connected to the body to create the limbs.\n\nThe body is then stitched together and covered in brightly coloured little clothing.\n\nTo make it look more lifelike, tiny diamonds and other decorations have been added.\n\nThe strings that are tied to tiny holes in the hands, head and back of the body are moved by the puppeteer.\n\nEither leg, arm, and shoulder, as well as the lower back and each side of the head, are connected by strings. A hand controller in the form of the letters H or X is attached to the strings. In other instances, additional strings are connected to various parts of the marionette\u2019s body.\n\nThe most prominent examples of string puppets are:\n\nKundhei\n\nKundhei is the name of the string puppets of Odisha.\n\nThey are made of light wood, and their skirts are long.\n\nThe puppeteer can move around with more ease because the puppets have more joints.\n\nThe strings are held together by a triangular prop.\n\nThe Odissi dance is prominently featured in Kundhei puppet shows.\n\nKathputli\n\nKathputli, a traditional string puppet from Rajasthan, derives its name from the Hindi terms for wood and doll, respectively, \u201cKath\u201d and \u201cputli.\n\nThe puppets wear colourful traditional Rajasthani clothing.\n\nThe presentation is accompanied by a dramatic folk music score, and the puppeteer\u2019s finger is attached to the strings.\n\nThe absence of legs on the puppets is a defining characteristic.\n\nBommalattam\n\nPuppetry called \u201cbommalattam\u201d has its roots in Tamil Nadu.\n\nIt combines elements of rod puppetry and string puppetry.\n\nThe puppeteer wears an iron ring on his head that is attached to the strings.\n\nWith some standing up to 4.5 feet tall and weighing up to 10 kilogrammes, the Bommalattam puppets are the biggest and heaviest marionettes in India.\n\nThe four distinctive stages of the Bommalattam theatre are Vinayak Puja, Komali, Amanattam, and Pusenkanattam.\n\nGombeyatta\n\nIt is a traditional puppet show from Karnataka.\n\nThey are modelled after the many characters from the Yakshagana Theatres.\n\nOne noteworthy feature of this puppet is the use of more than one puppeteer to control the puppets.\n\nShadow Puppetry\n\nShadow puppetry has a long history in India and has been handed down through the generations.\n\nFlat figures made of leather are used as shadow puppets.\n\nThe miniatures are painted identically on both sides of the leather.\n\nOn a white screen, puppets are positioned, and light is flashed on them from behind to cast a shadow.\n\nThe figurines are altered such that the silhouettes they produce on the white screen tell a compelling story.\n\nShadow puppet tradition is still prevalent in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Odisha.\n\na few well-known examples of shadow puppetry:\n\nTogalu Gombeyatta\n\nIt is the renowned shadow theatre of Karnataka.\n\nA distinctive feature of Togalu Gombayetta puppets is the variation in puppet size based on social rank, with enormous puppets portraying monarchs and religious leaders and smaller puppets representing the underprivileged and slaves.\n\nRavanchhaya\n\nThis style of shadow puppetry is the most dramatic, and it\u2019s very well-liked in Odisha.\n\nThe puppets made of deer skin are posed in dramatic and bold.\n\nSince they don\u2019t have any joints, learning this art is very challenging.\n\nIt is common to employ puppets that are not human, such trees and animals.\n\nBecause they have acquired in-depth instruction in their field, the Ravanchhaya artists are able to produce poetic and delicate theatrical narratives.\n\nTholu Bommalata\n\nIt is the shadow theatre of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nWith a classical musical background, the presentation focuses on legendary and holy stories from the Epics and Puranas.\n\nThe puppets have different colours on both sides and are larger.\n\nRod Puppetry\n\nIn Eastern India, it is most often used. Rod puppet performances are well-known in West Bengal and Odisha.\n\nThese puppets are controlled by the puppeteer with the help of rods.\n\nThree joints normally make up these puppets.\n\nBoth hands are connected to the rods at the shoulder, and the principal rod supports the puppet\u2019s head, which is connected to the neck.\n\nThe primary rod is concealed by the puppet\u2019s attire. The action rods are connected to the puppet\u2019s hands.\n\nThe puppeteer creates movement by moving their hands.\n\nBamboo, rice husk, and hay are used to create the puppet\u2019s body and hands.

They are little figurines with a head, arms, and a skirt that is long and flowing.\n\nAlthough there are notable exceptions, most puppets are made of fabric or wood.\n\nThese puppets look like limp dolls, a talented puppeteer can make them move in a number of ways.\n\nThe head is made of papier-mache, linen, or wood, and two hands protrude from right below the neck. The rest of the body is covered with a long, flowing skirt.\n\nThe human hand manipulates the puppet by placing the first finger on the head and the middle and thumb on the puppet\u2019s two other fingers.\n\nglove puppets are a common practice in Kerala, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Odisha\n\nIn Odisha, glove puppet shows focus on Radha and Krishna stories, in contrast to Uttar Pradesh where they primarily address societal issues.\n\nPavakoothu\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe traditional glove puppet show called Pavakoothu is presented in Kerala.\n\nIt developed in the 18th century as a result of the influence of Kerala\u2019s renowned classical dance-drama known as Kathakali on puppet shows.\n\nA puppet in Pavakoothu can be between one and two feet tall. Wooden arms and a wooden head are joined by thick fabric that has been cut and sewed into a small bag-like structure.\n\nThe puppets\u2019 faces are adorned with paint, tiny pieces of thin gilded zinc, peacock feathers, and other decorations.\n\nThe musical instruments used during the concert were chenda, chengila, ilathalam, and shankh .\n\nIn the majority of the world\u2019s areas, puppetry has been a crucial component of information exchange.

Although the majority of the ancient Indian literary works that have survived are religious texts, it is erroneous to characterise ancient Indian literature exclusively in terms of religion.\n\nIndian literature spans a variety of literary forms, including epics, songs, dramatic and didactic poetry, narrative and scientific writing, as well as oral poetry and music. Two ancient Indian epics are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Prior to the Gupta dynasty, a lot of secular literary works were produced. During this time, poetry and drama were in their prime.\n\nThe principal topics of these works included political events, allegories, comedies, romances, and philosophical issues. In Southern India, ancient Indian writings were written in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam, four Dravidian languages that also established their own literature and script.\n\nThe earliest of these, with literature from the first decades of the Christian era, is Tamil. Three Sangams (meetings of poets and writers) held at separate eras resulted in this development. Sangam literature frequently explores the topics of politics, love, and war.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n\u00a0Vedic Literature\nBetween the end of the Indus Valley Civilization and the start of the second urbanisation in the central Indo-Gangetic Plain in 600 BCE, India\u2019s history is known as the Vedic period, or Vedic age (c. 1500\u2013c. 500 BCE).\nWhen the Vedic literature, which includes the Vedas, was written in the northern Indian subcontinent (1300-900 BCE).\nThe Vedas are vast collections of religious writings from ancient India that were written in Vedic Sanskrit.\nThey are the earliest texts in both Sanskrit literature and Hinduism.\nIt is said that the Vedas were transmitted orally from one generation to the next.\nThey are frequently referred to as Shruti as a result. The four Vedas are Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, Atharva Veda, and Rig Veda.\nThe mantra text of each Veda is known as a Samhita.\n\nThere are two types of Vedic literature:\n\n\u00a0 Shruti Literature\n\u00a0 Smriti Literature\n\nShruti literature\u2013 The term \u201cShruti Literature\u201d refers to the sacred texts, which include the Vedas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, and Upanishads and is derived from the word \u201cShruti,\u201d which means \u201cto hear.\u201dSince it is canonical, contains revelation, and contains unquestionable truth, shruti literature is regarded as eternal.\n\nSmriti literature\u2013\u00a0The word \u201cSmiriti,\u201d which refers to supplementary information that could change over time, literally means \u201cto be remembered.\u201dVedanga, Shad Darshana, Puranas, Itihasa, Upveda, Tantras, Agamas, and Upangas are all part of the Smriti literature.\n\nRamayana And Mahabharata\nTwo ancient Indian epics are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.\nThese have been in their current form for millennia and represent the ethnic memory of the Indian people.\nThey were transmitted orally over the years by singers and storytellers, and they were probably first recorded in the second century BCE.\nGenerally credited to Maharishi Valmiki is the epic Ramayana.\nThe 24000 verses that make up the Ramayana are organised into seven Khandas, or volumes.\nIt\u2019s written in a poetic style with both entertainment and education in mind. It is Rama\u2019s story, and it describes how to achieve the four Purusharthas of human existence: Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha.\nWith one million lines, The Mahabharata is the longest poem ever written.\nThe Itihasa Purana, or Mythical History, is what it is called (because this history is not merely the depiction of events that happened, but these are the events that will always happen and repeat).\nIt was written by Vyasa and recounts the succession struggle between the Pandavas and the Kauravs for the crown, weaving together numerous incidents to create one epic.\nIn addition to the main story of the fight, a later addendum to the Bhagavad Gita also includes an integrated view of Dharma (performance of righteous duty in the selfless way of Nishkama Karma).\nPuranas\n\nThey helped Hinduism develop from the ancient Vedic faith. In Sanskrit, the word \u201cPurana\u201d literally translates as \u201cto resurrect the old.\u201dMost likely during the third and eleventh centuries AD, the Puranas were written.\n\nThe literature of the Puranas is broad and addresses a variety of subjects, including but not limited to:\n\nCosmology\nGenealogy/Medicine\nAstronomy\nGoddesses and Gods\nGrammar\nDemigods\nHeroes\nSages\n\nThey were written in order to show the populace the veracity of the Vedas. The Puranas impart philosophical and theological principles via well-known folklore and mythological tales.\n\nThe Puranas contain numerous tales and anecdotes from India\u2019s religious, social, and cultural past when paired with the Ithihas (Ramayana and Mahabharata).\n\nBased on the writings of Lomaharshana (a Ved Vyasa), the 18 Upa Puranas\n\nEarlier Buddhist writings\nThe Buddha\u2019s teachings were rehearsed and approved in the First Council in 483 BC, and then they were divided into the Three Pitakas.\nHis instructions were recorded in Pali somewhere around 25 BCE.\nThe earliest Buddhist literature is in Pali. The Sutta Pitaka is a collection of conversations between the Buddha and his followers.\nA compendium of rules for monastic organisations is known as the Vinaya Pitaka.\nThe Abhidhamma Pitaka is a systematised philosophical analysis of monks\u2019 academic and teaching output.\nThe Divyavadana, Dipavamsa, Mahavamsa, and Milind Panha, among others, are important Buddhist texts.\nThe Milindapanho is a compilation of conversations between the Indo-Greek king Menander and the Buddhist Nagasena.\nThe Jatakas are an important part of early Buddhist literature and are a collection of tales that have been incorporated into many sculptures.\nAshvaghosha is the author of the Sanskrit book Buddhacharita, which details the Buddha\u2019s life.\nImportant Indian ancient Sanskrit literary works\n\nSome of the ancient Indian literary works include the following:\n\nMudrarakshasa\nTime period-4th century to the 8th century CE\nAuthor \u2013 Visakhadatta\nVishakadatta\u2019s political intrigue Mudrarakshasa, which was written in the sixth century CE, is set in an intriguing era of Indian history. At the beginning of the play, Chanakya tries to persuade Rakshasa to join his cause so that Chandragupta can have a capable minister on his side. The name Mudrarakshasa alludes to Rakshasa\u2019s signet ring. It was taken by a spy for Chanakya.\nArthashastra\nTime period-2nd century BCE and 3rd century CE\nAuthor-Kautilya\nAn ancient Indian text written in Sanskrit on statecraft, political science, economics, and military strategy is known as the Arthashastra. The Arthashastra is a text on politics, economics, military strategy, governmental function, and social organisation that is attributed to the philosopher and prime minister Kautilya (also known as Chanakya).\nMalavikagnimitram\nTime period-5th century\nAuthor-Kalidasa\nKalidasa wrote the Sanskrit play Malavikagnimitram.It is his first play, and it is based on a number of incidents that took place under Pushyamitra Shunga. The tale of Agnimitra, the Shunga Emperor in Vidisha, and his love for the lovely handmaiden of his chief queen is told in Malavikagnimitram.\nVikramorvasiyam\nTime period-5th century CE\nAuthor-Kalidasa\nIn the fifth century CE, Kalidasa wrote the play Vikramorvasiyam.The plot centres on a human who develops feelings for a celestial girl. The piece is renowned for a \u201ccrazy scene\u201d in which the bereaved monarch wanders through a beautiful forest while apostrophizing different flowers and trees as if they were his love. One interpretation states that the term \u201cVikrama\u201d in the title refers to Vikramaditya, the patron king of Kalidasa.\nRaghuvamsa\nTime period-5th century CE\nAuthor-Kalidasa\nThe great poet Kalidasa created the literary masterpiece Raghuvamsa. The drama\u2019s creator, Raghuvamsa Kalidasa, is honoured. The drama centres on Lord Rama\u2019s ancestors, descendants, and the legendary warrior Raghu. The heroism and power of the legendary warrior Raghu are major themes of Raghuvamsam. It chronicles the lives of some of India\u2019s greatest military rulers. Lord Rama is without a doubt the most well-known of them all, as his life\u2019s story was preserved in the ancient epic Ramayana.\nMricchakatika\nTime period \u2013 5th century CE\nAuthor-Sudraka\nMricchakatika is a drama that takes place during the rule of King Plaka of the Pradyota dynasty in the historic city of Ujjayanai, India. Vasantasena is a wealthy courtesan or nagarvadhu who falls in love with Charudatta, a noble but poor young Brahmin. The play stands out among the existing Sanskrit plays for concentrating on a hypothetical situation rather than a classic tale or legend.\nKiratarjuniya\nTime period-6th century\nAuthor-Bharavi\nThe epic poem Kiratarjuniya by Bharavi is regarded as the most potent piece of Sanskrit literature. In eighteen cantos, Lord Shiva\u2019s battle with Arjuna (who took the form of a kirata, or \u201cmountain-dwelling hunter\u201d) at Indrakeeladri Hills near Vijayawada is described. It is one of the three main Sanskrit mahakavyas, or great epics, together with the Naisadhacarita and the Shishupala Vadha.\nSisupalavadha\nTime period- 7th or 8th century\nAuthor- Magha\nMagha created the Shishupala Vadha, a masterwork of classical Sanskrit poetry, in the 7th or 8th century (kavya). This Sanskrit poem, or kavya, is based on one of the epics, specifically the Mahabharata. Lord Krishna is enraged by Shishupala, the king of the Chedis in central India after he insults him repeatedly in an assembly. Shishupala is then killed.\nKamasutra\nTime period-400 BCE to 300 CE\nAuthor-Vatsyayana\nThe Kamasutra stands out among Sanskrit literature for having a nearly complete disregard for caste and class (varna) (jati). The writing style combines prose with poetry in the anustubh metre. The literature makes reference to the Purusharthas, or acceptable life goals, which are defined as desire, sexuality, and emotional fulfilment. The chapters of the book cover a variety of topics, including courtship, finding a partner, flirting, and maintaining authority in marriage.\nSangam Literature\nAround the third century B.C. to the third century A.D., South India (the region south of the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers) saw the Sangam Period.\nFour Dravidian languages\u2014Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam\u2014evolved their own literature and script and were used to transcribe ancient Indian manuscripts in Southern India.\nThe best work was published in anthologies, which were censored by distinguished thinkers who congregated at the sangams.\nThese literary works served as the earliest illustrations of Dravidian literature.\nThe earliest of them, Tamil, has literature that dates back to the very beginning of the Christian era.\nThis developed throughout the period of three Sangams, which were gatherings of poets and scribes that took place at various times.\nPolitics, love, and war are all common themes in Sangam literature.\nEttutogai, Pattuppattu, and Tolkappiyam are two significant works from the era.\nThe most well-known author of our time is Thiruvalluvar, who wrote Kural, a book that touches on many facets of life and religion.\nElango Adigal penned Silappathikaram, and Sittalai Sattanar wrote Manimegalai, the two sagas.\nAdditionally, they provide insightful information on Sangam politics and society.\nImportance of Ancient literary works\nThere is a great deal more to understand and absorb from ancient Indian literature than only the Vedas and epics.\nAncient literature also explains the Dharmashastras, which define a person\u2019s obligations and describe how a person should develop as a character. Shastras encompassed mathematics and science.\nKautilya\u2019s book Arthashastra, written in Sanskrit, discusses economic and governmental policy.\nThe popularity of Buddhist literature written in the Pali language also increased. It includes works of Buddhist literature like poetry, philosophy, and some grammar.\nAncient Indian literature is both beautiful and challenging to read and understand.\nThe formation of a person\u2019s character and the quest for happiness are both facilitated by the Vedas, Shastras, and Upanishads.\nThe primary subjects of old Sanskrit poets included love, nature, panegyric, moralising, and narrative.\nThe ancient poets spoke passionately of physical love when it came to love; they saw nature in connection to man rather than for its own sake.\nThe Sanskrit Kavya reaches a level of quality and perfection unmatched in Kalidasa\u2019s literature.\nConclusion\n\nIn its broadest sense, Indian literature encompasses both religious and commonplace writing, epic and lyric poetry, dramatic and didactic poetry, narrative and academic prose, as well as oral poetry and music. There is perhaps no other region of the world that has produced such a vast array of knowledge and wisdom books. Indian literature from the past is both beautiful and challenging to read and comprehend.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

He was well aware of Delhi\u2019s vulnerability to the Mughal emperors.\nThe idiom \u201cAttock to Cuttack\u201d refers to the Maratha Kingdom that Baji Rao-I imagined and wanted to raise the Saffron Flag above the ramparts of Attock.\nBaji Rao-I participated in 41 wars and never suffered a defeat.\nThis astute Maratha Prime Minister was successful in uniting the Marathas who had scattered after Shivaji\u2019s demise.\nThe Scindias, under the leadership of Ranoji Shinde of Gwalior, the Holkars, under Malharrao of Indore, the Gaekwads, under Pilaji of Baroda, and the Pawars, under Udaiji of Dhar, are all members of the Confederacy.\nHe was able to acquire one-third of Bundelkhand upon the passing of Maharaja Chhattrasal.\nMastani, his half-Muslim sweetheart from Bundelkhand, was not accepted into Maratha culture.\nHe moved the Marathas\u2019 administrative centre from Satara to Pune.\nBalaji Baji Rao succeeded his father Baji Rao-I when the latter passed away in 1740 due to sickness.\nMarathas versus British\n\nThe English finally prevailed in three battles between the Marathas and the English for governmental hegemony during the latter quarter of the 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th century. These conflicts resulted from the English\u2019s great ambition and the Marathas\u2019 split house, which gave them a reason to believe their endeavour would succeed.\n\nThe English in Bombay planned to establish an administration resembling that of Clive in Orissa, Bihar, and Bengal. The Marathas\u2019 disagreement over succession provided the English with a long-awaited opportunity.\n\nCauses of the Conflicts\n\nThe Great Maratha Wars or the Anglo-Maratha Wars refer to the three conflicts fought in India between the British East India Company and the Maratha confederacy or the Maratha Empire.\n\nThe Maratha Empire in India was destroyed along with the British victory in the wars, which started in 1777 and ended in 1818.\nThe third Peshwa, Balaji Baji Rao, passed away on June 23, 1761, the day after the Marathas were beaten at the Battle of Panipat.\nAfter his death, his son Madhav Rao took over as ruler.\nHe was a capable and competent commander who kept his nobles and chiefs united and swiftly succeeded in regaining the lost power and dignity of the Marathas.\nAs the Marathas\u2019 authority increased, the British grew more cautious of them and worked to prevent their restoration.\nThe British were free to assault the Marathas after Madhav Rao\u2019s death in 1772.\nAnglo-Maratha War I (1775\u201382)\nThe British\u2019s increasing intervention in Maratha internal and external matters, as well as the rivalry for power between Madhav Rao and Raghunath Rao, were the primary causes of the first Maratha war.\nWhen Peshwa Madhav Rao passed away, his younger brother Narain Rao succeeded him as Peshwa, but Raghunath Rao actually wanted the position.\nSo, in exchange for Salsette and Bessien as well as income from the Surat and Bharuch provinces, he asked the English to help kill him and make him Peshwa.\nRaghunath Rao received help from the British, who also provided him with 2,500 troops.\nThe Peshwa was invaded and defeated by the English and Raghunath Rao\u2019s combined force.\nThe Pact of Surat was signed on March 6, 1775, but it was not approved by the British Calcutta Council. Colonel Upton, who abandoned Raghunath\u2019s sovereignty and only promised him a pension, revoked the contract in Pune.\nRaghunath was given shelter notwithstanding the Bombay administration\u2019s denial of this.\nNana Phadnis gave the French a port on the west coast in 1777, breaking the agreement with the Calcutta Council.\nAs a result, fighting broke out between British and Maratha forces at Wadgaon, just outside of Pune.\nFirst Anglo-Maratha War\u2019s outcome\nThe East India Company held Salsette and Bessien.\nThe Marathas also gave it a guarantee that they would get their Deccan holdings back from Hyder Ali of Mysore.\nIn addition, the Marathas swore not to give the French any other provinces.\nEvery year, Raghunathrao was to receive a pension of Rs. 3 lakh.\nFollowing the Purandar Treaty, the British handed over to the Marathas all areas they had taken by force.\nMadhavrao II, Narayanrao\u2019s son, was recognised as the Peshwa by the English.\nAnglo-Maratha War II (1803\u201305)\nThe British East India Company and the Maratha Empire engaged in combat in Central India between 1803 and 1805 during the Second Anglo-Maratha War.\nThe second Maratha war was primarily sparked by the Holkars, one of the major Maratha clans, defeating Peshwa Baji Rao II.\nAs a result, Peshwa Baji Rao II signed the Treaty of Bassein in December 1802, requesting British protection.\nOther Maratha kings, such as the Gwalior-based Scindia rulers and the Nagpur and Berar-based Bhonsle rulers, would not accept this and attempted to fight the British.\nAs a result, in Central India, the second Anglo-Maratha war broke out in 1803.\nSecond Anglo-Maratha War\u2019s outcome\nIn these battles, the Maratha army was completely routed by the British.\nAn infant was installed on the throne under British guidance.\nThe Peshwa gave up in 1818.\nAfter being removed, he withdrew to a small estate in Bithur (near Kanpur). The Bombay Presidency took over most of his territory.\nHis adopted son, Nana Saheb, served as the revolt\u2019s leader in Kanpur in 1857.\nThe Central Provinces of British India were created from the Pindaris\u2019 territories.\nThe outcome of this fight was the demise of the Maratha Empire. The Maratha kingdoms were all seized by the British.\nAn unidentified Chhatrapati Shivaji ancestor was appointed as the Maratha Confederacy\u2019s ceremonial leader in Satara.\nThe British were given the territory of Rohtak, Ganga-Yamuna Doab, Gurgaon, the Delhi-Agra region, Broach, numerous Gujarati districts, portions of Bundelkhand, and the Ahmednagar fort when the Scindias signed the Surji-Anjangaon Treaty in 1803.\nThe Treaty of Deogaon, which was signed by the Bhonsle in 1803, gave the English control over Cuttack, Balasore, and the area west of the Wardha River.\nIn 1805, the Holkars agreed to the Treaty of Rajghat, which gave the British Tonk, Bundi, and Rampura.\nThe British took over substantial portions of central India as a result of the conflict.\nAnglo-Maratha War III (1817\u201319)\nThe rising Maratha desire to restore their lost territory and the British\u2019s oppressive rule over Maratha nobles and chiefs were the two main factors that led to the third and final conflict between the British and the Marathas.\nThe British dispute with the Pindaris, who the British thought was being protected by the Marathas, was another factor in the war.\nDuring the years 1817 and 1818, the conflict took place in Maharashtra and the neighbouring areas.\nThe Peshwa defeated the Maratha chiefs in places like Ashti, Nagpur, and Mahidpur when they invaded the British Residency in November 1817.\nOn November 5, 1817, the Treaty of Gwalior was signed, and Sindia was relegated to the role of a bystander in the fight.\nMalhar Rao Holkar and the British agreed to the Treaty of Mandsaur on January 6, 1818, which led to the deposition of the Peshwa and his pension.\nThe British seized more of his holdings, thus solidifying their control over India.\nThird Anglo-Maratha War\u2019s outcome\nDespite not taking part in the war, Sindia and the British signed the Treaty of Gwalior in 1817.\nIn accordance with the conditions of this treaty, Sindia gave the British Rajasthan.\nThe Rajas of Rajputana retained the Princely States until 1947 after consenting to British rule.\nThe Treaty of Mandsaur was drafted and signed by the British and the Holkar kings in 1818.\nCauses of Marathas\u2019 Demise: Inept Leadership\nThere was a dictatorial element to the Maratha state. The state\u2019s activities were greatly influenced by the personality and character of the ruler.\nHowever, later Maratha leaders like Bajirao II, Daulatrao Scindia, and Jaswantrao Holkar were useless and egotistical.\nAgainst English authorities like Elphinstone, John Malcolm, and Arthur Wellesley, they had little hope (who eventually led the English to victory against Napoleon).\nReasons for Maratha\u2019s defeat\nThe cohesiveness of the Maratha state\u2019s populace was constructed and accidental rather than organic, making it unstable.\nSince Shivaji\u2019s reign, no attempt has been made to put together a well-planned effort to develop the community, spread knowledge, or bring the populace together.\nThe religious-national movement helped the Maratha state to rise to power.\nThis shortcoming was exposed when the Maratha kingdom was placed against a European force constructed after the best Western models.\nThe Chhatrapati and the Peshwa were in charge of the loose confederation known as the Maratha empire.\nWhile giving lip service to the Peshwa\u2019s authority, strong rulers like the Gaikwad, Holkar, Scindia, and Bhonsle carved out established semi-independent kingdoms for themselves.\nIn addition, the various parts of the confederacy were at constant odds with one another.\nThe Maratha chief regularly sided with one or the other side.\nThe Maratha kingdom suffered from the lack of cooperation among the Maratha leaders.\nDespite their power and bravery, the Marathas fell short of the English in terms of effective leadership, troop organisation, and military equipment.\nMany of Maratha\u2019s defeats were caused by the centrifugal tendencies of fragmented leadership.\nThe Maratha army was weakened by treason within the ranks.\nThe Marathas\u2019 application of modern military techniques was insufficient.\nThe Marathas disregarded the vital importance of artillery. An artillery department was set up by the Poona administration, although it was ineffectual.\nThe Maratha leadership was unable to create a sound economic strategy to satisfy the period\u2019s changing demands.\nThere were no businesses or chances for international trade.\nBecause of this, a stable political system was not supported by the Maratha economy.\nThe English were better at using diplomacy to gain allies and isolate their enemies.\nThe division among the Maratha leaders made the work of the English simpler.\nThe English were able to attack the goal right away thanks to their superior diplomatic position.\nThe English maintained a well-oiled spy network to gather information regarding their adversaries\u2019 potentialities, strengths, vulnerabilities, and military strategies, in contrast to the Marathas\u2019 ignorance and lack of information about their opponent.\nThe forces of the Renaissance raised the English from the dead, releasing them from the Church\u2019s control.\nThey focused their efforts on colonial conquest, lengthy ocean voyages, and scientific discoveries.\nOn the other hand, medievalism, which was characterised by antiquated dogmas and beliefs, was still rife among Indians.\nThe day-to-day administration of the state didn\u2019t worry the Maratha chiefs.\nImperial merging was rendered impossible by the insistence on preserving the social stratification that existed due to the influence of the priestly class.\nConclusion\n\nThe Anglo-Maratha Wars I, II, and III all played significant roles in Indian history. The Mughal Empire was already under British rule at the time. However, despite their best efforts, the British were unable to seize control of the southern regions, which were governed by Maratha chieftains.\n\nAs a result of treaties with princely states, the British gained substantial holdings and territory in India, and India was unquestionably the crown jewel of the British Empire. These wars led to the collapse of the Maratha Empire. India was entirely governed by the British.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nIn truth, after the battles, India was claimed by the British, who defined it in an Orientalist fashion and mapped it according to their own concepts.\n\nArticle Written By:\u00a0 Atheena Fathima Riyas"

Some of them are as follows\n\nSocio-Political Contributions\nEquality: Regardless of caste, Basava thought that all people were formed as equals. To combat caste, class, and gender inequality, Basavanna joined forces with several other followers.\nWomen\u2019s empowerment: One of his numerous contributions to the renewal of today\u2019s tradition-bound society was his recognition of women\u2019s identity and rights. There is no denying that a society\u2019s view of women\u2019s status is a key indicator of its level of culture.\nVeerashaiva movement: Basavanna was a strong proponent of social change. He advanced to become the movement\u2019s leader for Veerashaiva. He established a cult that is still well-known today. The previous class of priests was eliminated. The mass dissemination of the ultimate truth was decided upon using the vernacular. It gave women a significant place in social and religious life. It gave everyone, regardless of wealth or poverty, a single ideal realization.\nAnubhava Mantapa: Basavanna firmly believed in the idea of a caste-free society where everyone had an equal opportunity to succeed. He founded the AnubhavaMantapa, a Lingayata academy of mystics, saints, and philosophers, to accomplish the noble goal.It acted as a clearinghouse for ideas regarding universal human values and ethics. Anubhava Mantapa has been referred to as \u201cThe First Religious Parliament of the World\u201d by the late Dr S. Radhakrishnan, a prominent philosopher and former president of India.\nPromoted inter-caste marriages: The social revolution of the twelfth century reached its pinnacle with the union of a Brahmin woman and an outcast cobbler\u2019s son from Harijan.\nPioneer of Democracy: A democratic social structure was to be established as Basavanna\u2019s strong and ultimate goal.\nGender equality: According to Basavanna, in the early Vedic era, men and women had equal rights. The wife and husband were regarded as being on an equal footing and shared in all social and religious obligations.\nPromotion of local language: The people\u2019s local language should be used as the medium for delivering secular and spiritual education.\nRespect towards women: Basavanna describes how women should be viewed in seven vachanas. In all of these vachanas, Basavanna emphasizes to his followers that it is wrong to want the wife of another man and that it is even worse to view a woman as anything other than a sister or mother. As a result, he creates a set of guidelines for his adherents.\nRejected caste system: He strongly opposed the caste system and the idea that some communities are superior to others, and he rid his associates of any sense of superiority or inferiority complexes.\nDignity of labor: By claiming that work is worship. He argued that all manual labour should be viewed with love and regard, even the grunt work people detested.\nLiterary Contributions\nCovered every shade of expression: From the utterance of seekers who have suffered from social injustices and differences to the joyful exclamation of the experience of Divine Bliss, his artistry has spanned every shade of expression.\nDenied superiority of Sanskrit in literature: Basava produced numerous vachanas. Writing religious and ethical literature in Sanskrit was customary before the advent of Basava. However, Basava started composing them in the common people\u2019s language, Kannada.\nReached the heart of the reader: Basavanna has done a commendable job of having each topic he addressed resonate with the reader\u2019s emotions. His vivid imagination and the emergence of figures and pictures were the results of his rich life experience, perceptive insight, and flexible brilliance.\nVachanas: Basavanna promoted social awareness through his poetry, known as Vachanas. The Shat-sthala-vachana (discourses on the six phases of salvation), Kala-jnana-vachana (forecasts of the future), Mantra-gopya, Ghatna Chakra-vachana, and Raja-yoga-vachana are only a few examples of the different Vachana that fall under this category.\nSpiritual And Philosophical Contributions\nHumanism: Basavanna was a well-known humanist who promoted a new way of living in which caste, gender, and social distinctions were meaningless and the divine experience was at the centre of existence.\nKayaka-Work Doctrine: According to Basaveshwara\u2019s philosophy of Kayaka (Work doctrine), everyone should earn their living by labour performed not just with the sweat of their brow but also to dedicate that labour to God. Work is viewed spiritually in Kayaka.\nMonotheism: The profound monotheistic belief in God as the absolute and highest Self known as Lord Shiva served as the movement\u2019s cornerstone.\nPromoted devotional worship: Devotional worship, which rejected Brahmin-led temple practices, was espoused by Basavanna. He was in favour of personalized, direct worship of Shiva through rituals like wearing icons and symbols like little lingas on one\u2019s person.\nDenied orthodox funeral practice: The Lingayats hold that there would be no return to this world after death since they will immediately join Lingaikya, who is considered to be God. Therefore, the Lingayats do not require traditional funeral grounds and bury their deceased as is customary for holy men.\nMoral teacher: People looked to Basaveshwara as a moral example of how to conduct themselves in society, live a pure life, and find salvation.\nCompassion: For Basava, compassion was not built on faith but it was supported by reason and science\nAgainst renunciation: Renunciation and dwelling in the forest are ruled out as cowardly tendencies to escape from life\nReason and experience: Reason and experience are the only guiding lights for free thinking and spiritual advancement.\nNon\u2013Violence: He strongly opposed human and animal sacrifices as a major proponent of ahimsa (non-violence).\nBasavanna and Sharana movement:\nThe Sharana movement he presided over attracted people from all castes. Like\u00a0most strands of the Bhakti movement, produced a corpus of literature, the vachanas, that unveiled the spiritual universe of the Veerashaiva saints.\nThe egalitarianism of Basavanna\u2019s Sharana movement was too radical for its times.\nHe set up the Anubhava Mandapa, where the Sharanas, drawn from different castes and communities, gathered and engaged in learning and discussions.\nSharanas challenged the final bastion of the caste order, they organized a wedding where the bridegroom was from a lower caste, and the bride a Brahmin.\n\nThe legacy of Basava and his contemporaries Sharanas (commoners who attained self-realization via Lord Basava\u2019s divine guidance and grace) is undoubtedly a live tradition that can still motivate a community even nine centuries later.\n\nThe vitality of that tradition and its attractiveness, even in modern times, are primarily due to the fusion of real spirituality and social awareness.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

Numerous academics and literary celebrities visited his court because of his enthusiasm for learning and liberal outlook.\n\nZia-ud-din Barani\n\nrenowned historian supported by Sultan Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq for approximately seventeen years.\n\nSanai-Muhammadi, Salat-i-Kabir, Inayat- Nama-i-Illahi, Massir-i-Saadat, and Hasrat-Nama are only a few of Barani\u2019s literary creations.\n\nHe is also noted for his well-known historical works Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi and Fatawa-i-Jahandari.\n\nBadr-ud Din Muhammad of Chach\n\nwas another eminent Persian scholar and poet who resided at the court of Muhammad ibn Tughlaq.\n\nHe composed the Shahnama, qasidas, ghazals, qitas, and rubais that make up Diwan.\n\nThe following emperor, Firoz Tughlaq, was likewise a big supporter of education. He used to offer learned persons and poets 36 lakh tankas. His court was graced with a number of academics,\n\nShams-i-Siraj Afif\n\nHe was the most notable poet in Firoz Tughlaq court.\n\nTarikh-e-Firoz Shahi is one of his major works written in five sections.\n\nHe documented the history of Firoz Tughlaq\u2019s reign in this extensive work.\n\nMuhammad Bihamad Khan\n\nThe Tarikh-i-Muhammad, which covers the history from the time of the Prophet Muhammad to 1439, is another great book created during the reign of Firoz Tughlaq.\n\nA few notable Persian literary works were also produced during the latter Tughlaq period.\n\nThese include Yahya bin Ahmad of Sirhind\u2019s Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi. This work is most likely the sole contemporary work that provides us with information about the Sayyid dynasty.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe heyday of Indo-Persian literature occurred during the reign of the first six Mughal emperors (1525\u20131707).\n\nIt was revived by new waves of talented Safavid Persian emigrants as well as growing Hindu participation in Persian writing, especially after the advent of Lodi rule (1451\u20131526), when Persian language and literature started to reach the Hindu administrative class.\n\nLike the Delhi Sultanate, Persian continued to be the official language of the Mughal court.\n\nWith his literary interests, Babur had his memoirs translated into Persian by Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khanan.\nBabar\u2019s autobiography, Tuzuk-I-Babari, which was written in Turkish, offers crucial details regarding the Mughal conquest of India.\nOne of the most significant sources about Jahangir\u2019s reign was Tuzuk-I-Jahangiri.\n\nAnother significant work that details Humayun\u2019s life and ascent to the throne is the poem Humayun-nama, which was penned by his half-sister, Gulbadan Begum.\n\nThe greatest emperor of this period was Akbar, The best literary works from Akbar\u2019s era are :\n\nAin-e Akbari and Akbarnama, authored by his court historian Abul Fazl.\u00a0\nThe Ramayana, Bhagwat Gita, and various Upanishads are among the Sanskrit literature that he translated into Persian.\nThe Mahabharata, a richly drawn work from this time period that was translated into Persian as Razmnama\nHamzanama, tells the tale of the legendary Persian hero Amir Hamza.\n\nTwo other significant authors from this time period were :\n\nBadauni, who wrote about the ethics of political rule\nFaizi\u00a0is regarded as a master of Persian poetry.\n\nMany books were produced under Shah Jahan\u2019s rule, especially those that were dedicated to the emperor, such Inayat Khan\u2019s Shah Jahan-nama.\n\nShah Jahan hired Abdul Hamid Lahori, the author of the Badshah Nama, to create a chronicle of his reign that would be similar to the Akbar Nama.\n\nPadshahnama was written by Abdul Hamid Lahori. It is a tale involving Shah Jahan.\n\nDuring Aurangzeb\u2019s reign, various satirists, like Mir Jafar Zatalli, published their Kulliyat (collection of verses).\n\nTexts such as Tabqat-i-Alamgiri aid in understanding the eighteenth century.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndo-Persian poetry progressively lost its position as Urdu literature took over with the entry of the British and the growing demand for a native reaction to the encounter with European culture.\n\nHowever, the uniqueness and significance of Indian contributions to the history of Persian literature, which can be found in nearly every discipline of literary output, merits additional and more complete investigation.\n\nArticle written by: Aryadevi"

        "[CONTENT]": "The Tebhaga movement was a notable peasant agitation that was started in Bengal by the All India Kisan Sabha of the Communist Party of India\u2019s peasant front (1946\u20131947).\n\nIt was the most intense peasant revolution in Indian history. On the eve of Bengal\u2019s division and India\u2019s independence, there was a violent peasant rebellion.\n\nLiterally, Tebhaga means \u201cthree shares of the crop.\u201d\n\nThe Tebhaga movement was the movement of sharecroppers (tenants).\n\nTwo-thirds of the produce from the land was demanded by tenants, with the remaining third going to the landlords. Basically, the term \u201cTebhaga\u201d movement derives from this principle demand.\n\nAlso read: Land Reforms in India \u2013 History and Status\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBackground of the movement\nThe Movement\nBackground of the movement\nBargadar was a person who, in accordance with the adhi, barga, or bhag system, cultivated another person\u2019s land in exchange for that person giving up a portion of the land\u2019s harvest.\nThe zamindars\u2019 relationship with the British government was based on the size and quality of the lands they held, which determined the amount of yearly tax the zamindars had to pay.\nThe class of jotedars, to whom the zamindars gave lands under the Pattani system, was below them.\nThe lands and agriculture were directly related to the jotedars class.\nThe total production from the land was set by jotedars to be split equally between the farmer and the jotedar, the landowner. Adhiary Pratha, or the \u201chalf-half system,\u201d was the name given to this method of land cultivation, which was most popular in north Bengal.\nA cultivator\u2019s labour was previously exploited by jotedars in a variety of ways, thus turning the poor bargadar into the landowner\u2019s slave.\nHe was always under threat from the jotedar that if he did not obey, he would take away the land and the bargadar would have to go hungry. This was an oppressive system.\nIn the early aftermath of a devastating famine in Bengal (1942), peasants\u2019 complaints rose as the nation\u2019s economic situation deteriorated.\nThe movement afterwards known as Tebhaga Andolan was sparked by the poor economic conditions, political turmoil, and intolerable social conditions of the peasants (Movement).\nThe Movement\n\nThe leaders of the Communist Party and the Krishak Samity profited greatly from the disturbance and gained the support of the destitute peasants and landless agricultural labourers.\n\nIn the Dinajpur district, the movement began in a region governed by PS Chirirbandar.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhen the farmers were all together, they declined to grant 50% and instead offered 33% of the total crop.\n\nArmed jotedars men and the adamant peasants got into a major altercation that left both sides hurt.\n\nHowever, after arresting the leaders and followers, the police seized control of the area.\n\nAdditionally, following the Bengal famine of 1943, the Communist-led Bengal Provincial Kishan Sabha called for a widespread movement among sharecroppers in September 1946 to retain Tebhaga (two-thirds) of the harvested crops.\n\nThis demand had been included in Kishan Sabha programmes since the 1930s, and the Floud Commission, which examined the awful situation of Bengal\u2019s agriculture in 1939\u20131940, had also deemed it to be just.\n\nThe Floud Commission, a land revenue commission established by the Bengali government in 1938, had shown the flaws in the then-current system that required sharecroppers to give up half of their produce as rent and, on top of that, to pay dozens of illegal cesses.\n\nCommunists organised peasants to transport the gathered crop to their threshing floor and make the two-thirds\u2019 share a reality by going out into the countryside.\n\n\u201cAdhi noy, tebhaga chai\u201d (we want two-thirds to share, not half) echoed around the room.\n\nThey began transporting harvested crops to their yards.\n\nThey only gave the jotedars a third of the crop share.\n\nNumerous fights followed by arrests, lathi charges, and gunfire resulted from this.\n\nAdditionally, by the end of 1946, Bengal\u2019s sharecroppers (bargadars, bhagchasis, or adhiar) started to assert that they would only give the jotedars a third of their crop instead of a half share, and that the crop would be stored in their khamars (godowns) rather than those of the jotedars before division.\n\nThe Floud Commission\u2019s recommendation of tebhaga should be put into effect via widespread resistance, the Bengal Provincial Kishan Sabha urged in September 1946.\n\nCommunist cadres travelled into the countryside to organise bargadars, who had grown to be a significant and expanding segment of the rural population, including many students from urban regions.\n\nLater, when the Muslim League Ministry under Suhrawarddi released the Bengal Bargadars Temporary Legislation Bill in the Calcutta Gazette on January 22, 1947, the agitation gained momentum.\n\nThe police made an effort to repress the peasants while the jotedars appealed to the government.\n\nHowever, other political developments made it more difficult for the administration to pass the Barga Bill into law.\n\nThe campaign persisted even after the Bargadari Act was passed in 1950.\n\nThe Act recognised the sharecropper\u2019s entitlement to two-thirds of the produce in exchange for his contribution of inputs.\n\nThe Bargadari Act of 1950 recognised bargadars\u2019 entitlement to a larger part of the crops produced on the land they tilled, but it was never put into practice.\n\nLarge expanses of land that were over the permitted land ceiling remained in the hands of wealthy landowners.\n\nA peasant rebellion protesting the lack of implementation of land reform legislation occurred in West Bengal in 1967.\n\nMajor land reforms were implemented in West Bengal starting in 1977 under the leadership of the Left Front government.\n\nPeasants were given access to land that was obtained over the land ceiling.\n\n\u201cOperation Barga\u201d was then launched with the intention of securing the peasants\u2019 tenancy rights.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the movement represented a turning point in India\u2019s history of agricultural movements since it showed the emergence of the poor peasants\u2019 and tribal sharecroppers\u2019 political consciousness. As a result, the Tebhaga movement is arguably the biggest peasant movement in India\u2019s history.\n\nAlso read: Popular Uprisings and Revolts against the British\n\nArticle Written By: Aryadevi E S"

Read the article to know more about Vijayanagara Art and Architecture.\n\nThe Vijayanagara emperors presided as Lord Virupaksha\u2019s representatives. They used the immense riches and resources they had amassed, to maintain the old temples as a whole. They also built many new temples, giving the architects, room to try out different designs and ideas.\n\nThe fervour to build new temples and add on to the old temples\u2019 existing buildings influenced and inspired the best sculptors, artists, and architects of the Empire, who channelled their creative energy into building monuments of unsurpassed magnificence.

Manuscripts, which are made of an even more fragile material than temples, degrade and crumble.\nThe excellent painters of the Vijayanagara Empire are still visible in a few temples, like the Virabhadra Temple in Lepakshi, and some museums have fragments of texts that were written and painted on cotton and other materials.\nVijayanagara Style of Architecture\nThroughout its reign, the Vijayanagara Empire constructed numerous temples. Granite was the primary material employed by the empire, while soapstone was used for the reliefs and sculptures that adorned the temples.\nThe Hoysala, Chola, and Chalukya empires, as well as other earlier empires, provided the architectural inspiration for the Vijayanagara Empire, which combined these aspects to produce its own distinctive architectural compositions.\nThey adopted the Dravidian architectural style and then added certain distinctive elements, giving it the name Vijayanagara style.\nLocal firm granite was the preferred building material because of its durability, much as it had been for the Badami Chalukyas.\nStrong fences surround the Vijayanagara temples, which are distinguished by elaborately pillared Kalyana mandapa (marriage halls), tall rayagopurams (carved colossal towers at the entrance of the temple), and life-size statues of gods and goddesses.\nDuring Krishnadeva Raya\u2019s rule, the Dravida style gained popularity, and during the following two centuries, many South Indian temples were built in this style.\nMortar combined with other materials is typically used in Vijayanagara\u2019s courtly architecture.\nTypically constructed of mortar and stone shards, Vijayanagara\u2019s courtly architecture frequently features secular designs with Islamic-inspired arches, domes, and vaults.\n\u00a0Distinctive elements of Vijayanagara architecture\nTemples honouring numerous monarchs were built throughout the Vijayanagara Empire, and their entrances were adorned with gigantic gates known as Raya Gopurams. These gates featured intricate carvings that significantly adorned their surface.\nHorses were the most popular theme for the carved pillars in open pavilions with platforms supporting monolithic statues, like Ganesh.\nElaborately pillared Kalyana mandapa (marriage halls)\nThe image of the god to whom the temple was dedicated was kept in the garbhagriha, the most sacred room in the temple, which was situated in the heart of the structure.\nAmman Shrines, which were shrines dedicated to the god\u2019s bride or wives\nArchitectural Wonders of Vijayanagara\nQueen\u2019s Bath\n\nA water pavilion, used for bathing, is a sizable square structure with a simple exterior and a multi-lobed arch doorway, but an elaborate, open-air interior with pointed arches, plaster-decorated domes and vaults, and corridors with projecting balconies that surround an interior pool. Today, this structure is known as the \u201cqueen\u2019s bath.\u201d It was possibly used by royal members as a personal bathing chamber or a cool relaxation area.\n\nLotus Mahal\n\nThe two-story pavilion known today as the \u201cLotus Mahal,\u201d which combines aspects of Islamicate architecture with those of temple architecture (the base, roof, and some stucco ornamentation), likely served as an event space or a meeting area for the emperor and his advisors. It features multi-lobed, recessed arches for its entrances, plastered ornamentation for the vaults and domes, and a stepped, pyramidal roof with finials reminiscent of temples.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nWhile the base, the multi-layered roof design, and the stucco ornamentation display an Indic temple style, the cusped arches, variously designed vaults, and the decoration in geometric and foliated motifs on the walls and ceilings indicate an Islamic character. Additional evidence of a thriving exchange between Turko-Persian and Indic cultures and a great desire to participate in the larger cosmopolitan culture beyond Vijayanagara\u2019s imperial borders.\n\nElephant stables\n\nThe elephant stables, which housed the royally utilised ceremonial elephants, are the most impressive of all courtly buildings in the city. The Vijayanagara army would need many more elephants than could fit in the stables (or twenty-two, if two were housed inside). The open area in front might have been used as a parade ground.\n\nRoyal platform\n\nA large platform dominates the royal centre. This multi-story stone theatre is surrounded by horizontal bands of low-relief friezes that portray many aspects of courtly life (such as the march of war animals, hunting scenes, soldiers engaged in combat, ladies performing traditional dances with sticks, and musicians).\n\nWater tanks\n\nNear the Mahanavami Dibba, a sizable water tank (pushpakarni) with a square shape is surrounded by a series of steps that descend to a lower level in a semi-pyramidal arrangement of black schist stone. Its design made it simple for individuals to enter and exit the water.\n\nThe reservoir was apparently utilised by royal members for ritual bathing and purification before prayers or for the immersion of metal deity incarnations during religious events. It was fed by the neighbouring Tungabhadra River by an aqueduct system.\n\nVirupaksha temple\nThe Virupaksha temple is the oldest Hindu shrine within the imperial complex that is still actively used for worship today.\nThe Vijayanagara rulers\u2019 patron deity was Virupaksha, a manifestation of the Hindu god Shiva.\nSince many Hindu temples face the rising sun, pilgrims typically enter from the east side of the walled temple complex\u2019s 160-foot-tall entrance tower (gopura).\nThe marriage of Virupaksha and his spouse, the regional folk goddess Pampa, after whom the settlement of Hampi gets its name, is commemorated with annual ceremonies at the temple.\nThe Vittala temple\nThe Vittala temple, which is devoted to a form of Vishnu, is the most impressive structure in the capital\u2019s sacred core. The complex, which includes the primary temple and many auxiliary shrines, dates to the fourteenth century. It is located inside a rectangular court.\nThe open, multi-pillared \u201cmarriage hall\u201d (Kalyana mandapa), which is utilised for events involving the symbolic marriage of the temple\u2019s deity to his wife, is a significant and defining feature of Vijayanagara art.\nThe hall features external piers with riders on rearing yalis (mythical beasts) and elaborate brackets. It consists of an elevated platform surrounded by rows of large, artistically carved granite columns.\nSince the fifteenth century, yalis, which represent a hybrid of a horse and a human, have been a prominent motif in south Indian temples.\nThe unique aspect of the temple is a stone chariot, or Garuda shrine, which is meant to resemble a wooden chariot used to transport metal representations of gods during religious festivals.\nGaruda is Vishnu\u2019s animal mount (vahana), and as is typical in temples, it stands facing the god who is revered there. In the inner sanctum of the temple, immovable deities are present.\nMonolithic sculptures\n\nLarge monolithic engravings are also present at the location, which made use of the enormous stones that dot the landscape around the city. For instance, Krishnadevaya, regarded as the greatest emperor of the Vijayanagara empire, contributed a magnificent sculpture of Narasimha, the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu, depicting him reclining in a yoga position beneath a seven-hooded serpent (though is sometimes shown with five or ten-heads).\n\nThe serpent known as Adisesha, upon which Vishnu is said to sleep, served as a seat for Narasimha in one of his incarnations.\n\nConclusion\n\nVijayanagara was the first southern Indian kingdom to encompass the three primary linguistic and cultural regions of this area\u2014Kannada, Telugu, and Tamil\u2014and the greatest and most powerful empire in pre-colonial south Indian history.\n\nThe impressively destroyed capital today testifies to the grandeur of an empire that was ruled from that city, as well as to the extent to which Islamic-inspired forms and practises altered Indic courtly life during the Vijayanagara period and its importance as a major population centre and nexus of trade routes.\n\nIn 1986, UNESCO declared the remains at Hampi in Karnataka a World Heritage Site in recognition of the importance of Vijayanagara.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

The understanding of the diversity and richness of our culture has been made possible due to the development of the Sanskrit language during those times.\n\nIt is the most ancient language of our country and is one of the 22 scheduled languages listed in the Constitution.\n\nSanskrit is the only language that transcended the barriers of region and boundaries. From north to south and from east to west, there is no part of India that has not contributed to or has not been affected by the Sanskrit language.\n\nDevelopment of Sanskrit literature\n\nThe development of Sanskrit grammar began with Panini in 400 BC with his book Asthadhyayi being the oldest book in Sanskrit grammar.\n\nThe chaste form of Sanskrit developed between 300 to 200 BC and was a refined version of Vedic Sanskrit.\n\nThe first evidence of the use of Sanskrit can be found in the inscriptions of Rudradaman at Junagarh in the present Southern Gujarat region.\n\nHowever,\u00a0 The Gupta period when the use of Sanskrit in poetries can be traced. This is totally a period of creation of pure literature which is evident in works such as Mahakavyas ( epics ) and Khandakavyas (semi-epics).\n\nIn the field of Sanskrit literature,\u00a0The Gupta period is known as the period of unique creation because a variety of literary works developed during this reign.\n\nAnother important aspect of it is related to the ornate style in literary works. Many of the plays developed during the Gupta period were also written in Sanskrit.\n\nHowever, it is to be noted that one of the features of these plays was the use of Sanskrit language by the characters of high varna and the use of Prakrit language by women and Shudras.\n\nAlso read: Salient Features of Indian Society\n\nClassical Sanskrit Literature\n\nMost of the literature in Sanskrit has been divided into the Vedic and Classical categories.\n\nThe two epics: Mahabharata and Ramayana are also part of the classical category. Irrespective of their centrality to the Hindu religion, these epics can also be considered to be the pre-cursors of Sanskrit Kavya ( epic poetry ), nataka ( classical drama ), and other treatises on medicine, statecraft, grammar, astronomy, mathematics, etc.\n\nMost of this Sanskrit literature was bound by the rules of grammar that have been explained brilliantly in Panini\u2019s Ashtadhyayi, a treatise on the rigid rules which bind the Sanskrit language.\n\nAshtadhyayi:\n\nThe only surviving foundational and analytical source of Sanskrit grammar, Ashtadhyayi (literally, \u201ceight chapters\u201d), was written by Panini and is believed to have been published in the 4th century BCE.\n\nDespite the fact that India has more than 5000 spoken languages, everyone agrees that Sanskrit is the only sacred language and the source of all known sacred literature. The standardization of the language, which is still used in various forms now, was done by Panini.\n\nSanskrit Poetry\n\nThis genre is also called Kavya or poetry.\n\nUnlike the drama section where the story is the main focus of the text, poetry concentrates more on the form, style, figure of speech, etc.\n\nOne of the greatest Sanskrit poets is Kalidasa who wrote Kumarasambhava ( the birth of Kumar or Kariya, the son of Shiva and Parvati ), and Raghuvamsa ( the dynasty of the Raghus ).\n\nHe also wrote two smaller epics called Meghaduta ( the cloud messenger ) and Ritusamhara ( medley of seasons ).\n\nOne should not forget to mention the contribution of poets like Harisena who wrote during the Gupta period.\n\nHe wrote several poems in praise of the valor of Samudra Gupta and it was so well appreciated that it was inscribed on the Allahabad pillar.\n\nAnother extremely popular Sanskrit poet was Jayadeva who wrote Gita Govinda in the 12th century. It concentrates on the life and escapades of Lord Krishna.

These were compiled alongside the smritis that are known as Dharmashastras.\n\nThese are the basis of the laws governing the subjects of most of the Hindu kingdoms. These not only elucidate the rules according to which property could be held, sold, or transferred but also elaborate on the punishments for offenses ranging from fraud to murder.\n\n\u00a0Manusmriti ( laws of Manu ):\n\nWhich defines the role of men and women in society, their interaction at a social plane, and the code of conduct that they were supposed to follow.\u00a0 The Manusmriti might have been written and compiled between 200 BC and 200 AD.\n\nArthashastra:\n\nOne of the most famous texts about statecraft from the Mauryan period is Kautilya\u2019s Arthashastra.\n\nIt concentrates on the economic and social conditions of the Mauryan empire.\n\nThe due focus was also given to the military strategy which should be employed by the State.\n\nThe text mentions that \u2018 Kautilya \u2018 or \u2018 Vishnugupta \u2018 wrote it. Historians argue both these names were an alias for Chanakya who was a learned scholar at the court of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya.\n\nWhile Sanskrit was the preferred language of the courts in the ancient period, it got an impetus in the Gupta period, which employed many great poets, dramatists, and scholars of various subjects.

Read the article to learn more about the Doctrine Of Lapse.\n\nThe British East India Company used the doctrine of lapse, which was regarded as an expropriation and annexation tactic, to enlarge the British Empire\u2019s borders on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nDuring the years 1848 to 1856, Lord Dalhousie, the then-Governor General of India, mostly implemented this annexation/expropriation program.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWho was Lord Dalhousie?\nWhat was the Doctrine of Lapse?\nFeatures of the Policy\nThe Doctrine of Lapse: States Annexed\nConsequences of the Doctrine of Lapse\nWho was Lord Dalhousie?\n\nKnown as Lord Dalhousie, James Andrew Broun Ramsay served as both the Governor General of India from 1848 to 1856 and as the 1st Marquess of Dalhousie.\n\nThe Doctrine of Lapse is not really credited to Lord Dalhousie, despite the fact that he is widely regarded as having developed it. The British East India Company created the doctrine of lapse immediately before Lord Dalhousie came to power in 1847, or in the year 1847.\n\nWhat was the Doctrine of Lapse?\n\nThe doctrine was rooted in the British belief that they had a moral and legal obligation to modernize and stabilize Indian states, which they considered to be mismanaged by native rulers. By annexing states without a male heir, the British claimed they were preventing chaos and ensuring good governance.\n\nIf the prince of a princely state passed away without a natural or biological male successor, the doctrine of lapse said that the kingdom would be put under the control of the British East India Company\nThe British East India Company actively applied the Doctrine of Lapse until 1859. The policy was viewed as illegal since it was believed to have been used to fraudulently acquire princely states. This approach was also thought to be one of the driving forces behind the 1857 uprising.\n\nWhat characteristics do the Doctrine of Lapse and earlier methods of adopting an heir share?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nLong before the Doctrine of Lapse came into effect, a ritualised procedure of choosing an heir from a group of candidates was used to determine who would succeed the prince if his natural or biological male heir could not be produced.\n\nIn any case, if the prince passed away prior to choosing the heir or candidate for the throne, one of his widows would be qualified to choose the heir from the group as the successor to the kingdom and was subject to release all of his natural relatives.\n\nFeatures of the Policy\nAccording to the doctrine, if a princely state\u2019s prince died without a natural or biological heir, the state would be subjected to British East India Company authority.\nAlthough Lord Dalhousie did not create this idea, he was the one who recorded it and got it widely recognised in order to extend the British East India Company\u2019s sway.\nBefore Lord Dalhousie declared the Doctrine a national policy, it had already been developed and stated by the Court of Directors of the British East India Company in early 1847. A few small princely states had been acquired or seized as a result of this approach.\nAccording to the theory, an adopted heir would only be eligible to inherit the prince\u2019s personal possessions and properties rather than the kingdom.\nAccording to the concept, the Prince of the princely state\u2019s adopted son would not be qualified to receive any of the pensions that his father had been getting.\nThe policy had opposed the Indian princes\u2019 customs of adopting an heir to the throne of their choosing.\nOne of the primary drivers of the Revolt of 1857 is thought to have been this philosophy.\nThe British East India Company annexed the princely kingdom of Kittur in 1824 under the terms of the Doctrine of Lapse, which was established well before the Governance of Lord Dalhousie.\n\nRead:\u00a0India\u2019s Struggle for Independence: Indian Freedom Movement \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nThe Doctrine of Lapse: States Annexed\nState\n\t\nYear of annexation/seizure\n\n\nJaintia\n\t\n1803\n\n\nKozhikode\n\t\n1806\n\n\nGuler\n\t\n1813\n\n\nKannanur\n\t\n1819\n\n\nKittur\n\t\n1824\n\n\nKutlehar\n\t\n1825\n\n\nKodagu\n\t\n1834\n\n\nKangra\n\t\n1846\n\n\nSatara\n\t\n1848\n\n\nAngul\n\t\n1848\n\n\nJaitpur\n\t\n1849\n\n\nSambalpur\n\t\n1849\n\n\nBaghat\n\t\n1850\n\n\nUdaipur\n\t\n1852\n\n\nJhansi\n\t\n1853\n\n\nNagpur\n\t\n1854\n\n\nArcot\n\t\n1855\n\n\nJaswan\n\t\n1849\n\n\nKachar\n\t\n1830\n\n\nKullu\n\t\n1846\n\n\nPunjab\n\t\n1849\n\n\nSurat\n\t\n1842\n\n\nChhattisgarh\n\t\n1854\n\nAccording to the concept, Kittur was acquired by the East India Company in 1824 before Dalhousie.\n\nThe titles and pension were denied to Nana Sahib, Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao II\u2019s adopted son.\n\nAwadh was annexed to the English East India Company on February 7, 1856 CE due to internal misrule, under the rules and conditions of the Doctrine of Lapse. This annexation was one of the main causes of the Revolt of 1857.\n\nConsequences of the Doctrine of Lapse\nDue to the lack of a biological heir to the throne, several of the Indian princely states lost their lands to the British East India Company under the Doctrine of Lapse.\nAfter the policy\u2019s empowerment, a large number of Indian princes lived unhappy lives, which ultimately contributed to the Revolt of 1857.\nNana Sahib and the Rani of Jhansi had issues since the pensions for the heirs were restricted and treated disrespectfully. The introduction of the policy prevented the Rani of Jhansi\u2019s adoptive son from succeeding to the throne.\nAfter Lord Dalhousie, the Governor General left for Britain in 1856, there was the revolt of 1857, which led to harsh criticism of Lord Dalhousie\u2019s lead.\n\nAfter Dalhousie\u2019s tenure, the Doctrine of Lapse was abandoned by his successors. The new policy was to recognize adopted heirs, and the British became more accommodating in their approach to princely states.\n\nThe Doctrine of Lapse left a legacy of distrust between the British and Indian rulers. It contributed to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (also known as the Indian Mutiny or Sepoy Mutiny), as many Indian states saw the British as untrustworthy and encroaching on their rights.\n\nThe Doctrine of Lapse represents one of the many policies and actions taken by the British East India Company and the British Crown during their rule over India. It remains a historical point of contention and a symbol of colonial overreach in Indian history.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas"

What was the background for such a pact? what was its nature? What were the results of the pact? Read further to know more about the Lucknow Pact.\n\nThe All India Muslim League and the Indian National Congress agreed to the Lucknow Pact in Lucknow in December 1916. The agreement was made at the yearly meetings of both parties to lay out the shared political principles, including the demands for India\u2019s \u201cSelf-Governance\u201d after the war.\n\nA participant from both parties, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, urged that pressure be applied to the British government to liberalize the nation and give its residents more autonomy.\n\nThe All India Muslim League and the Indian National Congress developed cordial relations as a result, and Mohammed Ali Jinnah was awarded the title of \u201cAmbassador of Hindu-Muslim Unity\u201d by the nightingale of India, Sarojini Naidu.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBackground of the Lucknow Pact\nThe Lucknow Pact\u2019s nature\nUnderstanding the Lucknow Pact\nResults of the Pact\nConclusion\nBackground of the Lucknow Pact\nBy 1906, a League had been formed with the primary goal of forging good ties with the British. This League was then known as the \u201cAll India Muslim League\u201d in a moderate sense.\nThe League, however, chose to shift its support towards the British due to the British decision to divide Bengal.\nAt the time, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, a member of the All India Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, decided to take advantage of the situation to push for British reforms on behalf of both parties.\nFor the first time during a combined session, both parties sat silently.\nThe Hindu Muslim Unity idea originated when the extremists led by Tilak and the moderates led by Gokhale decided to meet in Bombay. There, they were joined by the Muslim League and developed their constitutional demands through mutual debate.\nThe leaders of the two parties subsequently assembled in one location with identical ideas and arguments in support of their demands.\nA total of 19 elected members from both parties sent a message to the Viceroy for discussion of the constitutional revisions in October 1916, just a few months after the Bombay meeting.\nThe ideas from the earlier meeting were considered and adopted in the subsequent meeting in Calcutta in November 1916.\nThe Lucknow Pact, 1916, as it was then known, was finally reaffirmed by the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress in their respective annual sessions held in Lucknow in December 1916.\nThe Lucknow Pact\u2019s nature\n\u201cSelf-government\u201d will be available to Indian citizens.\nThe Indian Council shall cease to exist.\nInstead of using Indian finances, the British government will be responsible for paying the Secretary of State\u2019s salary for any Indian concerns.\nThe Legislative Assembly\u2019s members will choose the president from among themselves.\nThe Legislative Assembly\u2019s term will be for a period of five years.\nA distinct electorate shall be established for each community until needed.\n150 people will make up the Central Legislative Council.\nIndian citizens must make up at least half of the Council\u2019s membership.\nThe remaining 4/5 of the members will be elected once around 1/5 of them are nominated.\nWith an average weighting of roughly one-third of the total members, Muslims should be granted representation in the Central Council.\nAll candidates, save those nominated, will be chosen using the adult franchise.\nIn proportion to their population, minorities must be represented.\nThe proportion of Muslims in provincial legislatures will be determined by the provinces.\nCongress endorsed the Muslim League\u2019s position on separate electorates, which would be maintained until any one community wanted joint electorates, even though the League committed to present the government with common constitutional proposals.\nAdditionally, a set percentage of members in both the national and provincial legislatures were allocated to Muslims.\n\nIndia\u2019s Struggle for Independence: Indian Freedom Movement \u2013 ClearIAS\n\nUnderstanding the Lucknow Pact\nThe Muslim League and the Indian National Congress both agreed on the idea of a separate electorate, demonstrating that both parties were aware of the importance of local politics and how the selfish interests of various communities living in India contributed to the partition of the country in 1947.\nThe importance of the Muslim community\u2019s representation was acknowledged, but this left the door open for future increases in communal politics.\nPrior to the Lucknow Pact in 1916, the League had no political presence.\nWhen it became apparent that there was ongoing discord between the people and their leaders, riots for communalism broke out in Bihar, the United Provinces, and Bengal.\nIf the 3/4th of members of any religion disagreed, the legislature could not pass the decision. As a result, the Indian legislature adopted a communalism veto.\nThe most significant error was approving one-third of Muslim representations on the grounds that they were a minority, even if the Muslims earned it on the one hand and communal politics on the other.\nThe agreement made it explicit that each of India\u2019s diverse communities had its own interests.\nProvince by province, the legislative representation of Muslims was determined. One of the most perilous pacifist initiatives of Congress was this one. It acknowledged both collective term and collective privileges.\nNevertheless, the Lucknow Pact was hailed as a sign of Hindu-Muslim harmony at the time. The togetherness only lasted a short time.\nResults of the Pact\nThe Congress accepted the idea of separate electorates, which suggested that the Congress and the Muslim League joined together as different political entities, despite the fact that both organizations made a deliberate effort to show a united front.\nIn the Muslim League\u2019s development of the two-nation thesis, this was a turning point.\nAttempts to unite the masses of the two communities were ignored when the leaders of the two factions met.\nOn the other hand, the difficult choice by Congress to embrace the idea of two electorates was a real attempt to ease minority concerns about majority dominance.\nIn addition, the individuals were really excited about this reunion.\nEven the government made the decision to placate nationalists by stating in Montagu\u2019s August 1917 declaration that it would eventually allow Indians to self-rule.\nConclusion\n\nA turning point in the nationalist movement for liberation might be seen in the Lucknow Pact between Congress and the Muslim League. The Lucknow Pact created the appearance of Hindu and Muslim political harmony in the country. However, it was simply a fleeting impression. The parties\u2019 agreement formally established the establishment of a separate communal electorate.\n\nArticle Written By: Atheena Fathima Riyas\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)"

Yes\n\nThey adopted both the North Indian Nagara Bhumija style and the South Indian Dravida style.\n\nThe most significant of these temples are those at Palampet (Ramappa temple), Hanamkonda (Thousand Pillared temple), and the temples in the Warangal fort, including the vast, abandoned Swayambhunadha temple complex.\n\nWho built Thousand Pillared Temple?\n\nThe Thousand Pillar Temple also called the Rudreshwara Swamy Temple was constructed by Rudra Deva in 1163 AD. This temple is one of the finest examples of Kakatiya architecture and sculpture.\n\nKeerthi Thoranas at Gateway\n\nAnother illustration of a distinctive Kakatiya style used only in this area for the entrances to temple complexes is Keerthi Thoranas.\n\nEarthquake-Resistant structures using Sandbox Technology & Iron Dowels\n\nAlmost 800 years back, Kakatiya built great constructions that can withstand severe earthquakes.\n\nThe Ramappa Temple and the 1000 Pillar Temple are two excellent examples of sandbox-built buildings that are resistant to earthquakes.\n\nThe sand was used by Kakatiya in the construction\u2019s foundations. For the sand mixture to become strong, foundations were filled with a powdered mixture of granite, jaggery, and Terminalia chebula (known as karakakaya in Telugu), depending on the size.\n\nThey have only erected large, heavy constructions on this Sand Mixture foundation.\n\nTo lessen the effects of earthquake vibrations, they also used iron dowels to secure the stones of walls, pillars, and temple rooftops.\n\nMelted iron was poured through tiny tunnels or holes drilled in each of the rocks used to build these dowels.\n\nAs a result, these dowels hold the rocks together strongly making the total construction fit like a frame and stronger.\n\nElaborate Carvings\n\nThe temples have multi carvings of different themes from upana to the prasthara.\nThe elegant open works by which the bracket shafts are attached to the pillars, as well as the lattice window and doorframes, are the other most interesting features.\n\nClose Proximity to Tank, Temple, and Town\n\nAnother distinct feature of Kakatiya Architecture is the common linkage characteristic of the Tank, Temple, and Town.\nThey constructed the temples near the water bodies (such as lakes and tanks) that they had created.\nWater tanks (water conservation structures) invariably resulted in the rise of flourishing towns with temples knitted together.\n\nNandi Mantapa\n\nAs with any Shiva temple, there is a massive Nandi at the entrance to the Shiva shrine.\nNandi\u2019s massive structure is carved from a single piece of black basalt.\n\nShiva Shrines Facing East\n\nShiva\u2019s shrine faces east, while the other shrines face south and west.\nThis was because the Kakatiya was Lord Shiva devotees who desired early morning sun rays to fall directly on Shiva Lingam.\n\nStar Style\n\nAll of the Kakatiya temple structures are in the shape of a star, as is the Ramappa temple.\n\nFeatures of Ramappa Temple\n\nRecharla Rudra, a general of Kakatiya king Ganapati Deva, built the Ramappa temple in 1213 AD during the reign of the Kakatiya Empire.\n\nRamalingeswara Swamy is the presiding deity here (Shivalingam).\n\nIt is also known as the Ramappa temple, after the sculptor who worked on it for 40 years.\n\nIt is the only temple that has been named after its sculptor.\n\nThe construction of the temple, where the Ramalingeswaram is housed, started in 1173 AD and was finished 40 years later, in 1213 AD.\n\nMaterials Used\n\nStone is used to build the temple. But in order to reduce the weight of the temple in accordance with the soil\u2019s characteristics, the Sanctorum was constructed of thin brick.\n\nThese bricks are smaller than those used today and float in water. Such bricks have never been used in the nation, and it is still unclear how they were made.\n\nThe maha mandapam and some of the sculptures are constructed entirely of black stone inside the temple, while red and white stones are used to construct the exterior.\n\nSculptures / Motifs\n\nShivatandavam, Sivakalyanam dance forms, the Ramayana, and the Mahabharata are all depicted in lovely sculptures.\n\nThe sculptures also depict key scenes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Ksheera Sagara Mathanam, and Sivaparvati Kalyanam. Dance and martial arts are also included.\n\nTwelve sculptures of Madanikas, Naginis, and Koyastris in different positions surround the temple. A few of the statues represent the importance of women in the Kakatiya dynasty as well as their jewelry.\n\nThe Kateshwara temple is on the left, the Kameshwara temple is on the right, and the Nandi idol faces the sanctum.\n\nThe Perini Shivatandava were the main subjects of the sculptures in the temple.\n\nDrainage and Lakes\n\nThe rainwater drainage system that was built around the temple provides insight into the Kakatiyas\u2019 technical prowess.\n\nA short distance from the temple, Ramappa Lake is constantly full of water.\n\nBetween the two mounds, a levee and sluices were used to create the lake.\n\nIt can store 2,912 TMC, and the water level is 35 feet. The pond measures 610 meters.\n\nFarmers cultivate two crops a year on about 10,000 acres with two sluices. This is still the main pond in the area.\n\nEarthquake Technology\n\nBecause the 800-year-old Ramappa temple was built using sandbox technology, it is still standing today.\n\nAt the temple construction site, a three-meter-deep foundation is dug and filled with sand. Make sure to maintain moisture.\n\nThe temple was built by stacking stones on the sand.\n\nOther Features\nIn the Sanctorum, the Shivalingam is visible even without electric lighting. There are four substantial black stone pillars in the mahamandapana in front of the Sanctorum. As the outside light hits the lingam, it appears to be brighter.\nImages of Egyptian and Persian people can be seen in some locations. During the Kakatiya era, they are known to have interacted with foreigners. Additionally, there are some sculptures of Buddhists and Jains.\nBrief on Kakatiya Dynasty\nBetween the 12th and 14th centuries, the Kakatiya dynasty of South India ruled the majority of the eastern Deccan region, which includes Telangana and Andhra Pradesh today, as well as a small portion of eastern Karnataka and southern Odisha.\nTheir capital was Orugallu, now known as Warangal.\nFor more than two centuries, the early Kakatiya kings were subject to the Rashtrakutas and Western Chalukyas as feudatories.\nIn 1163 CE, under Prataparudra I, they seized control of the region by putting down other Chalukya subjects in Telangana.\nIn the 1230s, Ganapati Deva (1199-1262) significantly increased Kakatiya territory and brought Telugu-speaking lowland delta regions near the Godavari and Krishna rivers under Kakatiya rule.\nRudrama Devi (1262\u20131289), one of the few queens in Indian history, succeeded Ganapati Deva.\nWhen Marco Polo travelled to India in 1289\u20131293 he was complimentary of Rudrama Devi\u2019s rule and personality.\nShe was successful in stopping Devagiri Yadavas (Seuna) incursions into Kakatiyan territory.\nThe Delhi Sultanate\u2019s Alauddin Khilji invaded the Kakatiya region in 1303, which resulted in disaster for the Turks.\nThe Kakatiya army put up a brave fight against Ulugh Khan\u2019s second assault in 1323, but they were ultimately overcome.\nA distinctive architectural style was also developed during the Kakatiya era; notable examples include the Warangal Fort, the Thousand Pillar Temple in Hanamkonda, the Ramappa Temple in Palampet, and the Kota Gullu in Ghanpur.\nInscriptions, including about 1,000 stone inscriptions and 12 copper-plate inscriptions, provide a lot of information about the Kakatiya era.\nOne of the sources is a 1978 book on the history of the Kakatiyas written by P.V.P. Sastry and published by the Government of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nMust-Know Facts about UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India click here\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

He is known as the father of Radio science as well. Read here to learn more about the multi-faceted life of J.C Bose.\n\nSir Jagadish Chandra Bose was an eminent Indian scientist who was way ahead of his time concerning his work and scientific endeavours.\n\nThe founder of Bengali science fiction is regarded as Bose. He created the crescograph, a tool for gauging plant growth. In his honour, a moon crater was named.\n\nThe unheard contributions of Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose are immense in the walks of the pre-independence era as a scientist and a freedom fighter.\n\nJ C Bose discovered wireless communication and was named the Father of Radio Science by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering.\n\nHe was responsible for the expansion of experimental science in India.

He met Jesuit Father Eugene Lafont there, and he credits him with greatly influencing the growth of his interest in the natural sciences.\n\nIn 1879, he graduated with a BA from the University of Calcutta.\n\nBose was admitted to Christ\u2019s College, Cambridge, to study natural sciences on the advice of Anandamohan Bose, his brother-in-law and the first Indian Wrangler at the University of Cambridge.\n\nHe earned a BSc from University College London, which was connected with the University of London in 1883, and a BA (Natural Sciences Tripos) from the University of Cambridge in 1884.\n\nIn 1887, Bose married feminist and social worker\u00a0Abala Bose.\n\nScientific journey of Jagadish Chandra Bose\n\nBose was appointed as an officiating professor of physics at Presidency College, Kolkata in 1885. In those days, such posts in were mostly given to Europeans, and Indians were only appointed temporarily with 1/3rd of the pay.\n\nBose was popular among the students for his teaching style and demonstration of experiments. After three years of work in this temporary post, the value of his professorial work was recognized and the administration made Bose\u2019s appointment permanent, with retrospective effect.\n\nBose invented the Mercury Coherer which is a radio wave receiver. This device was used by Guglielmo Marconi to build a radio. Bose was thus a key figure in the invention of the modern radio and also in sonic technology.\n\nFollowing is a brief timeline of his scientific activities.\n\n1894-1899: Jagadish Chandra Bose Created radio waves as short as 5mm.\n\nSuch waves are now better known as microwaves and are used in radars, ground and satellite communication, remote sensing, and microwave ovens.\nAlso devised a portable apparatus (10\u2033 x 12\u2033) for the study of their optical properties.\nIt had the earliest waveguide and horn antenna of today\u2019s microwave engineering.\n\n1895: He was the first to demonstrate the wireless transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves at Presidency College (now Presidency University), Kolkata.\n\nThese waves had a frequency of 60 GHz and traveled a distance of over 23 meters.\nA plaque from IEEE, immortalizing this landmark achievement exists today at Presidency University, Kolkata.\nBose was a pioneer of multimedia communication in every way.\nBose made improvements on another instrument called \u2018the coherer\u2019, for detecting the radio waves.\n\n1899-1902: Initiated detailed study of coherer leading to his discovery of the common nature of the electrical response to all forms of stimulation, in animal and plant tissues as well as in some inorganic models.\n\nIn 1900, his paper titled \u201cOn the Similarity of Responses in Inorganic and Living Matter\u201d at the International Congress of Physics, Paris garnered huge appreciation.\n\n1902-1907: He continued efforts to devise inorganic models of the biophysical phenomena underlying electrical and mechanical responses to stimulation, the transmission of excitation in plant and animal tissues, and vision and memory.\n\n1907-1933: During this period he devoted himself mainly to the study of response phenomena in plants, the complexity of whose responses lies intermediate between those of inorganic matter and animals.\n\nJagadish Chandra Bose contrived a very sophisticated instrument called the crescograph, which could record and observe plants\u2019 minute responses to external stimulants.\nIt was capable of magnifying the motion of plant tissues to about 10,000 times their actual size and, in doing so, found many similarities between plants and other living organisms.\n\nInspired by nationalistic ideals, on 30th November 1917, he founded the Bose Institute in Calcutta.\n\nOn this occasion, he delivered his famous address \u201cThe voice of life\u201d and dedicated the institute to the service of the nation.\n\nSwami Vivekananda, Sister Nivedita (whose influence is reflected in the institute\u2019s emblem of vajra), Sara Chapman Bull (whose generous philanthropy was significant in setting up the Institute), and Rabindranath Tagore were among those who inspired and supported J. C. Bose in his endeavors.\n\nAt the institute, he continued efforts to devise inorganic models of the biophysical phenomena underlying electrical and mechanical responses to stimulation, the transmission of excitation in plant and animal tissues, and of vision and memory.\n\nLater Life and Death\n\nJagadish Chandra Bose authored two illustrious books; \u2018Response in the Living and Non-living\u2019 (1902) and \u2018The Nervous Mechanism of Plants (1926).\n\nHe was knighted in 1917 and elected the Fellow of the Royal Society in 1920 for his amazing contributions and achievements.\n\nHe died aged 78, on 23 November in 1937, in Giridih, India.\n\nLegacy of Jagadish Chandra Bose\n\nOn the occasion of the 164th birth anniversary of legendary Indian scientist Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose and as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsava, Vijnana Bharati and Ministry of Culture, Govt. of India organized an \u201cInternational conference on the contributions of J C Bose: A Satyagrahi Scientist\u201d, at Inter-University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi.\n\nBose holds the first patent in the world for a solid-state diode detector used to detect electromagnetic waves. He was averse to all forms of patenting and patented the diode only due to pressure from his colleagues.\n\nIn 1896, Jagadish Chandra Bose wrote Niruddesher Kahini (The Story of the Missing One), a short story that was later expanded and added to the Abyakta collection in 1921 with the new title Palatak Tuphan (Runaway Cyclone). It was one of the first works of Bengali science fiction.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

        "[CONTENT]": "What are the ideological similarities and differences between Gandhi and Ambedkar?\n\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi also known as the \u2018Father of the Nation\u2019, was the main architect of the Indian freedom struggle, and B.R. Ambedkar was the main architect of the Constitution of independent India.\n\nBoth leaders had played a prominent part in the making of India. Both of them had many concepts in common, despite having different convictions in many areas.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIdeological Differences between Gandhi and Ambedkar\nSimilarities between Gandhi and Ambedkar\nConclusion\nIdeological Differences between Gandhi and Ambedkar\nBoth Gandhi and Ambedkar believed in democracy as a method of government but their ideology differs on the nature and scope of democracy. As Ambedkar believed in the parliamentary form of government as a system for independent India. Whereas, Gandhi had little respect for the parliamentary form of government.\nBecause of his social activist nature, Ambedkar had very rigid principles whereas Gandhi had no rigidity to ideology except the uncompromising principle of non-violence.\n\nExample: Ambedkar, in his early age also believed in reform and reconstruction of the evil practices that prevail in Hinduism but in the later phase, he left Hinduism, denounced it, and wanted to destroy it fully as he started believing that there is no scene of reform.\n\nThere is no doubt that Ambedkar was vocal for lower caste people and was not ready to compromise on their rights but Ambedkar\u2019s politics highlighted the aspect of Indian disunity, on the other hand, Gandhian politics was more inclined toward Indian unity.\n\nExample:\u00a0Under Communal Award 1932- a separate electorate provision for SC/STs in the state legislature and parliament was agreed by Ambedkar but Gandhi went on fast unto Death for this provision.\n\nGandhi always believed that even prior to imperial rule, India has always been a nation and it was the British who distorted the cultural unity of India. On the other hand, Ambedkar believed that this notion of Indian unity is a byproduct of Imperial rule over India which wasn\u2019t consciously done by the Britishers but their legal system, suppressive policies, white man\u2019s supremacy, oppression, and destruction had created a sense of unity and oneness among the people of India that helped them unite.\nGandhi believed in \u2018Ramraj\u2019 and \u2018Gramraj\u2019 as the real independence for India. But for Ambedkar, untouchability, casteism, etc is the real nature of a village at that time that denies equality, fraternity, and also liberty to most individuals. Ambedkar believed that \u2018Gramraj\u2019 would continue the social hierarchy based on inequality and discrimination.\nGandhi and Ambedkar highly disagreed on the concept of mechanization of production and the use of heavy machinery. Ambedkar believed that machinery and modern civilization will benefit all but Gandhi blamed mechanization for the exploitative socio-economic order in the world.\nAmbedkar held that man and man should be the center of religion and everyone should be treated equally whereas Gandhi believed that the center of religion must be between man and God alone.\nAmbedkar did not believe in the varna system or caste hierarchy whereas Gandhi said there is nothing wrong with caste hierarchy its just those evil practices that needed reform.\nAmbedkar denounced Vedas and scriptures and believed that the caste system and untouchability were the manifestations of the Hindu religious scriptures. On the contrary, Gandhi believed that the caste system has nothing to do with religious spirituality.\nAmbedkar believed in freedom of religion, free citizenship, and separation of state and religion. Gandhi also is a firm believer in freedom of religion but never believed in the idea of separation of politics and religion.\nGandhi believed in the principle of satyagraha, non-cooperation, hartal, and civil disobedience as a weapon to make a change. On the contrary, Ambedkar believed in constitutional agitation as a means of change.\nFor Ambedkar, the untouchable was not a part of the Hindu community and regarded them as a religious minority. He preferred to call them a \u2018minority by force\u2019 or \u2018religious minority\u2019. On the contrary, For Gandhi, untouchables were an integral part of India and untouchability was a social evil prevailing in the society.\nAmbedkar wanted to solve untouchability through laws and constitutional ways, whereas Gandhi sees untouchability as a moral stigma.\nSimilarities between Gandhi and Ambedkar\nThe symbolism included in some of both people\u2019s activities bears a remarkable resemblance. Gandhi\u2019s burning of foreign clothing and Ambedkar\u2019s burning of Manusmriti should not be viewed as sentimental actions. Manusmriti and foreign clothing instead stood in for India\u2019s enslavement and confinement.\nGandhi and Ambedkar, both leaders believed in the idea of education to make the individual\u2019s desire for change, integration, and reform.\nBoth prominent leaders of India believed in freedom of religion, free citizenship, etc. Both believed in religion as an agent of social improvement and change.\nAmbedkar and Gandhi both believed in the limited sovereign power of the state and limited authority of the government. They believed that people should be the ultimate sovereign. Gandhi in fact believed that the least governance is the best governance.\nBoth Gandhi and Ambedkar believed in non-violence but for Ambedkar, the application of non-violence is different than Gandhi\u2019s concept of non-violence. For Gandhi, it\u2019s remaining non-violent in every situation, but Ambedkar believed in relative violence if necessary.\nThey never believed in violent overthrow of any kind. Both Gandhi and Ambedkar believed in the idea of social transformation through peaceful and democratic means. Both of them wanted to solve the problem of disintegration and disharmony prevailing in society through the peaceful rehabilitation of the oppressed/depressed classes.\nConclusion\n\nMany people around the world have tremendous regard for these two guys and have also voiced criticism. In addition to aiding in India\u2019s independence, they worked to solve the social issues of the day. The issues that the lower castes were recognized by both of them, and they assisted in their empowerment.\n\nThey made an effort to alter the existing systems and guide India\u2019s development. They had different strategies for getting rid of untouchability, despite agreeing that it was the main problem facing the social order. Additionally, they cleared the ground for India\u2019s independence.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

His parents were unable to respond to his inquiries concerning life, death, and the afterlife.\n\nWhen Mool Shankar was asked to get married in accordance with social customs, he fled his house. For the next 20 years, he traveled the land, stopping at temples, shrines, and other revered locations.\n\nHe spoke with yogis who lived in the mountains or forests and questioned them about his problems, but no one was able to provide him with the ideal solution.\n\nFinally, he reached Mathura, where he encountered Swami Virajananda. Swami Virajananda took Mool Shankar on as a pupil and gave him the instruction to study the Vedas directly.\n\nThroughout his study, he discovered the answers to all of his questions about life, death, and the hereafter. Mool Shankar was given the responsibility of disseminating Vedic knowledge across society by Swami Virajananda, who also gave him the new name Rishi Dayanand.\n\nWhat were his spiritual beliefs?\n\nMaharishi Dayanand was a proponent of Hinduism as it is described in the Vedas, free from distortion and trimmings. He placed the highest priority on maintaining the integrity of the faith.\n\nHe was a fervent supporter of the ideas of Dharma, which he held to be impartial and representative of truth. Anything that did not conform to reality was unjust or unfair, or went against the Vedic principles was considered Adharma in his eyes.\n\nHe supported the practice of Ahimsa, or non-violence, and held reverence for human life regardless of circumstances.\n\nBack to Vedas: A call by Dayanand Saraswati\n\nHinduism, in Swami Dayanand\u2019s opinion, has deviated from its core, and many of the traditions that are still practiced are in conflict with the Vedas.\n\nHe saw the Vedas as \u201cIndia\u2019s Rock of Ages,\u201d the infallible founding text of Hinduism. So he coined the phrase \u201cBack to the Vedas.\u201d\n\nAs he accepted modernity, the phrase \u201cBack to the Vedas\u201d did not call for a return to the Vedic era. Instead, it was a plea for the resurgence of Vedic knowledge and religious purity.\n\nHe criticized the ignorant priests and subsequent Hindu literature (such as the Puranas) for corrupting Hinduism.\n\nArya Samaj of Dayanand Saraswati\n\nDayanand Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj in Bombay on April 7, 1875. It was a \u201csociety of the nobles\u201d or a Hindu reform movement. The Samaj was founded with the intention of removing bogus notions from Hinduism.\n\nThe Samaj\u2019s motto was \u201cKrinvan to Vishvam Aryam,\u201d which translates to \u201cMake this world honorable.\n\nThe Samaj commands its adherents to denounce ritualistic behaviors such as idol worship, pilgrimage, bathing in sacred rivers, animal sacrifice, offering in temples, supporting the priesthood, etc.\n\nAdditionally, rather than blindly adhering to traditional rites and ideas, the Samaj urged its adherents to think for themselves.\n\nThe Arya Samaj tried to eliminate a number of social problems in addition to seeking a spiritual restructuring of the Indian mentality. The education of women and widow remarriage were foremost among these.\n\nIn the 1880s, the Samaj started initiatives to encourage widow remarriage. Maharishi Dayanand opposed child marriage and emphasized the need of educating girls. He declared that for the sake of society as a whole, an educated man needs an educated wife.\n\nSwami Dayanand wrote the book \u201cSatyarth Prakash\u201d in 1875. It contains the clarifications of Vedic principles & his socioreligious views.\n\nShuddhi Movement by Dayanand Saraswati\n\nMaharishi Dayanand created the Shuddhi Movement to convert Hindus who had either freely or involuntarily converted to other religions like Islam or Christianity back to Hinduism.\n\nThose who wished to return to Hinduism were given Shuddhi, or purification, and the Samaj did a good job of gaining access to the various social classes and bringing the downtrodden masses back into the folds of Hinduism.\n\nClick here to read more about socio-religious movements\n\nWhat were his contributions to the education field?\n\nMaharishi Dayanand was very certain that ignorance was the primary cause of Hinduism\u2019s adulteration. To teach his disciples the Vedic knowledge and to help them spread it further, he established a number of Gurukuls.\n\nAfter his passing in 1883, his followers founded the Dayanand Anglo Vedic College Trust and Management Society ( DAV School) as a result of his beliefs, teachings, and concepts.\n\nOn June 1st, 1886, Lala Hans Raj was appointed headmaster of the first DAV High School, which was founded in Lahore.\n\nConclusion\n\nThough the Arya Samaj and Maharishi Dayanand were never directly involved in the fight for Indian independence, their lives and teachings had a significant impact on a number of significant figures, including Lala Lajpat Rai, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Madam Cama, Ram Prasad Bismil, Mahadev Govind Ranade, Madan Lal Dhingra, and Subhash Chandra Bose.\n\nArticle written by : Jis John Sebastian"

Moreover, the right to amend was reserved by the British Parliament.\n\nNationalists\u2019 Response\n\nNearly all the sections and Congress unanimously condemned the GoI Act of 1935.

However, the diarchy system remained complex and was criticized for being cumbersome.\n\nFoundation for Post-Independence Governance:\n\nThe Act laid the foundation for the administrative structure that India would adopt after gaining independence in 1947. Many features of the Act influenced the design of the Indian Constitution, which came into effect in 1950.\n\nCommunalization of Politics:\n\nThe continuation of separate electorates and the reservation of seats for various religious and social groups contributed to the communalization of Indian politics. This had lasting implications for post-independence India, leading to the demand for a separate Muslim state and the eventual partition in 1947.\n\nLegal Framework:\n\nThe establishment of the Federal Court provided a legal framework for adjudicating constitutional matters. This experience contributed to the development of the judicial system in post-independence India.\n\nEmergency Powers:\n\nThe emergency provisions in the Act foreshadowed similar provisions in the post-independence Indian Constitution. The lessons learned from the use of emergency powers during British rule influenced the drafting of constitutional provisions related to emergencies.\n\nRepresentation of Minorities:\n\nWhile the Act attempted to address the representation of minorities, the communal approach to political representation persisted and continued to influence Indian politics even after independence.\n\nPrincely States and Federal Structure:\n\nThe inability to fully integrate princely states into the federal structure outlined in the Act had implications for India\u2019s post-independence territorial integrity. The issue of integrating princely states was resolved during the integration process that followed independence.\nConclusion\n\nThe Government of India Act, of 1935, played a crucial role in shaping the administrative and constitutional trajectory of India. While it fell short of fully addressing the aspirations of Indian leaders for self-governance, it provided important lessons and experiences that contributed to the development of independent India\u2019s administrative and constitutional framework.\n\nArticle Written By: Priti Raj"

Jyotirao Phule was one such reformer whose efforts in fighting against the caste system are remembered till date.\u00a0\n\nThe world-renowned political philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, once said, \u201cMan is born free, but everywhere he is in chains\u201d.\n\nThis was particularly true in the case of pre-Independent India riddled with redundant caste hierarchies that valued and ranked people based on their birth.\n\nThe lower castes were subjugated to undue violence and deprivations and were effectively excluded from mainstream society. Let us examine how Jyotirao Phule, played a role in mitigating the rigidities of the caste system and what efforts he had put into women\u2019s emancipation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nJyotirao Phule: A brief introduction\nPhule\u2019s childhood and early life\nSocial movements\nPhule\u2019s efforts towards women education\nThe fight against caste discrimination\nSatya Shodak Samaj\nDeath\nConclusion\nJyotirao Phule: A brief introduction\n\nJyotirao \u201cJyotiba\u201d Govindrao Phule was a well-known social reformer and thinker of India during the nineteenth century. He served as the leader of the movement against India\u2019s pervasive caste system. He rose up against the Brahmins\u2019 rule and fought for the rights of peasants and other members of the lower castes.\n\nThroughout his life, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule battled for the education of girls and was a pioneer for women\u2019s rights in India. He is credited with founding the first Hindu orphanage for the unfortunate kids.\n\nPhule\u2019s childhood and early life\n\nIn 1827, Jyotirao Govindrao Phule was born in Maharastra\u2019s Satara district. Govindrao, his father, ran a vegetable stall in Poona. The original name of Jyotirao\u2019s family was \u201cGorhay,\u201d and they belonged to the \u201cmali\u201d caste. Malis were socially avoided by Brahmins because they were seen as belonging to a lower caste. The family adopted the name \u201cPhule\u201d as a result of Jyotirao\u2019s father and uncles working as florists. When Jyotirao was only nine months old, his mother died.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nJyotirao was a bright young man who had to give up on his education at a young age due to his family\u2019s financial situation. He began by working on the family farm and assisting his father. A neighbour who saw the little prodigy\u2019s talent convinced his father to enrol him in school. Jyotirao enrolled in the Scottish Mission High School in Poona in 1841 and graduated in 1847. He made a Brahmin acquaintance there named Sadashiv Ballal Govande, who remained a close buddy of his throughout his life. Only thirteen years old at the time, Jyotirao wedded Savitribai.\n\nSocial movements\n\nA social revolution in Indian society began in 1848 as a result of an incident that motivated Jyotiba to fight against the social injustice of caste discrimination. Jyotirao received an invitation to one of his friends\u2019 wedding who was from a high caste Brahmin family. However, after learning about Jyotiba\u2019s background, the bridegroom\u2019s family humiliated and assaulted him at the wedding. Jyotirao fled the ceremony because he was determined to oppose the existing caste system and social constraints.\n\nHe made it his life\u2019s mission to relentlessly push against social majoritarian dominance and worked toward the emancipation of all people who were affected by this social injustice.\n\nThomas Paine\u2018s beliefs had a big impact on Jyotirao after reading his well-known book, \u201cThe Rights of Man.\u201d He thought that the best way to address social ills was to educate women and members of lower castes.\n\nPhule\u2019s efforts towards women education\n\nSavitribai Phule, Jyotiba\u2019s wife, backed his efforts to guarantee women and girls the right to an education. Savitribai, one of the few literate women of her day, learned to read and write from her husband Jyotirao.\n\nJyotiba founded a ladies\u2019 school in 1851 and invited his wife to instruct the students there. Later, he established two additional schools for girls in addition to an indigenous school for members of the lower castes, namely the Mahars and Mangs.\n\nAfter realising the miserable conditions faced by widows, Jyotiba founded an ashram for young widows and finally came to support the concept of widow remarriage.\n\nHis era\u2019s society was patriarchal, and women\u2019s status was especially appalling. Both female infanticide and child marriage were frequent occurrences, with minors occasionally becoming married to men who were significantly older. Before they reached adolescence, these ladies frequently lost their husbands, leaving them without any familial support.\n\nIn 1854, Jyotiba, who was distressed by their situation, founded an orphanage to protect these poor children from the society\u2019s unkind treatment.\n\nAlso read: Women freedom fighters: The unsung heroines\n\nThe fight against caste discrimination\n\nThe traditional Brahmins and other upper castes were attacked by Jyotirao and labelled as \u201chypocrites.\u201d He ran an anti-authoritarian campaign and exhorted the \u201cpeasants\u201d and \u201cproletariat\u201d to resist the limitations placed on them.\n\nHe welcomed guests of different backgrounds and castes into his home. He supported gender equality, and he put his views into practise by including his wife in all of his social reform initiatives. He thought that the Brahmin used religious symbols like Rama as a tool to oppress the lower caste.\n\nThe society\u2019s traditional Brahmins were incensed by Jyotirao\u2019s actions. They accused him of corrupting societal rules and regulations. He was accused of\u00a0promoting the Christian Missionaries by many. However, Jyotirao was adamant and chose to carry on the movement. It\u2019s interesting to note that Jyotirao had several Brahmin acquaintances who contributed to the movement\u2019s success.\n\nSatya Shodak Samaj\n\nJyotiba Phule founded the Satya Shodhak Samaj in 1873. (Society of Seekers of Truth). He conducted a systematic deconstruction of historical ideas and beliefs before rebuilding one that promoted equality. The Hindus\u2019 ancient holy texts, the Vedas, were harshly denounced by Jyotirao. He used a number of other ancient writings to trace the origins of Brahmanism and accused the Brahmins of creating cruel and exploitative regulations in an effort to preserve their social supremacy by repressing the \u201cshudras\u201d and \u201catishudras\u201d in society.\n\nThe Satya Shodhak Samaj\u2019s mission was to rid society of caste prejudice and free the oppressed members of lower castes from the stigmas imposed by Brahmins. The word \u201cDalits\u201d was initially used by Jyotirao Phule to refer to everyone who the Brahmins regarded as belonging to a lower caste and being untouchable. Everyone was welcome to join the Samaj, regardless of caste or class.\n\nAccording to some documented accounts, they even encouraged Jews to join the Samaj. By 1876, the \u201cSatya Shodhak Samaj\u201d had 316 members. Jyotirao made the decision to build a communal bathing tank outside his home in 1868 to demonstrate his tolerant attitude toward all people and his desire to eat with anyone, regardless of caste.\n\nDeath\n\nJyotiba Phule spent his entire life working to free the untouchables from Brahmins\u2019 oppression. He was not just a social reformer and activist, but also a successful businessman. He worked for the Municipal Corporation as a contractor and cultivator as well. Between 1876 until 1883, he was the Poona Municipality\u2019s Commissioner.\n\nAfter having a stroke in 1888, Jyotiba became paraplegic. Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, a renowned social reformer, died on November 28, 1890.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ideas underpinning Mahatma Jyotirao Phule\u2019s never-ending struggle against societal stigma, which are still incredibly relevant today, may be his greatest legacy. People in the nineteenth century were accustomed to accepting these discriminatory practises as social norms that had to be upheld without question, but Jyotiba worked to end this caste, class, and colour discrimination.\n\nHe was the forerunner of novel social reform concepts. He began awareness efforts that eventually served as an inspiration for people like Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, who later took significant steps to end caste discrimination.\n\nArticle written by: Caroline Abraham"

        "[CONTENT]": "It is important to know about the fight of Sree Narayana Guru against the caste system for social equality in the caste-ridden Kerala society of the 19th and 20th centuries. Read this Article to know more about Guru and his message to the world.\n\nIn 1888, back in a day when only Brahmins were allowed to install idols, Narayana Guru visited Aruvippuram, a village located in the southern district of Thiruvananthapuram. He picked up a rock from Neyyar River and consecrated it as Lord Shiva. His reply to a group of agitated Brahmins who reached the spot the next day was \u201cthis is not a Brahmin Shiva, but an Ezhava Shiva\u201d. The Brahmins left tongue-tied. It was the turning point in a significant change in the social structure of the day.\n\nRelated link: Socio-religious movements in India\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWho was Sree Narayana Guru?\nImportant teachings of Sree Narayana Guru:\nHis contributions:\nConclusion:\nWho was Sree Narayana Guru?\n\nSree Narayana Guru is considered as a hero and prophet of the Kerala Renaissance. Born to Madan Asan and Kuttiyamma in an Ezhava family in 1856, in Chempazhanthy village near Thiruvananthapuram, he grew up to be a social reformer, philosopher, and educationist. The Guru, who was a scholar in Hindu philosophy and Sanskrit, dedicated his life to eradicating the social and economic backwardness of the Ezhavas and other underprivileged groups. He was born into an Ezhava family during a time when a caste-based society in Kerala severely oppressed members of such communities, known as Avarna.\n\nSree Narayana Guru has a vision of a world where all humanity is united. The Guru made efforts to get rid of whatever was preventing society and the human mind from anything that stood in the way of such. The Shiva idol on the stream made the first sound of that attempt in 1888. Those who see the statue only as a temple statue are unable to comprehend the act\u2019s conceptual underpinnings. It is committed to realizing the potential of philosophy to change people both internally and externally.\n\nImportant teachings of Sree Narayana Guru:\nThe Guru\u2019s great message that \u2018one caste one religion and one god is mankind\u2019 is the most discussed in society.\nVidya\u2019s purpose is to know and communicate, not to debate or win.\nWhatever a man\u2019s religion may be, as long as it improves him as a person, it is acceptable.\nWhen acting for one\u2019s own benefit, one should also consider others\u2019 needs.\nAsk not, Say not Think not caste.\nIt is not right to be lazy.\nLiquor is poison Make it not, Sell it not, Drink it not.\nWhatever may be the difference in men\u2019s creed, dress, language, etc they all belong to the same kind of creation; there is no harm at all in their dining Together or having marital relations with one another.\nDevoid of dividing walls of caste or race or hatred of rival faith we all live here in Brotherhood.\nHis contributions:\nIn order to give everyone, especially members of the lower caste and oppressed groups in society, the ability to practice their religion, the Guru went on to establish more than 40 temples throughout the state of Kerala.\nThe Guru also led the \u2018Vaikom Satyagraha\u2019 protest movement against caste discrimination, untouchability, and inequality.\nIn order to promote the virtues of cleanliness, education, devotion, agriculture, handicrafts, and trade, the Guru founded the Sivagiri foundation in 1924.\nHe dedicated a temple to Lord Shiva and placed a slab with the phrases Truth, Ethics, Compassion, and Love written on it. In Kerala\u2019s Aruvippuram hamlet, this was the first time a Hindu idol was ordinated by a non-brahmin, which set off an anti-caste movement against the upper-caste people.\nIn his poetry, he conveyed the essence of Indianness and emphasized the unity that underlies the world\u2019s seeming diversity.\nHe also founded an Advaita Ashram in Kalady.\nHe kept mirrors in place of idols in one of the temples he erected in Kalavancode. This represented his teaching that each person possessed a spark of the divine.\nHe wrote various books in different languages. A few of them are Advaitha Deepika, Asrama, Thevarappathinkangal, etc.\n\nHe was also known for his \u2018liberating humor\u2019. Once when Guru was asked by a judge whether burning or burying was the right way to dispose of dead bodies, he replied, \u201cCrush them in an oil press, they will make good manure.\u201d When the judge wailed, Guru asked him: \u201cWhy? Will it hurt?\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe path to enlightenment and liberation, according to Guru, was modern education and learning English. However, it is saddening to see that Guru\u2019s writings still don\u2019t find a place in Kerala\u2019s syllabuses. To counter the propaganda and polarisation efforts of Hindutva groups, Kerala and the rest of India must treasure and celebrate the secular and pluralistic legacy of Narayana Guru.\n\nWe can perceive that Sree Narayana Guru, a pioneer in social work and philosophy, envisioned a future in which all people would live in harmony. Anything that was hindering society and the human mind was attempted to be removed by Sree Narayana Guru. The Guru also wanted to build a community that was above the bounds of caste and religion. Similarly, from this, we can understand religion and God from the perspective of Sree Narayana Guru. What Sree Narayana Guru says about religion in this article\u00a0makes it abundantly evident that self-identification is every religion\u2019s ultimate objective.\n\nArticle written by: Krishnapriya JR"

Despite having several pupils, four of them became the most significant Shankaracharya adherents and rose to fame. They were also in charge of the four monasteries founded by Shankaracharya. The following are Shankara\u2019s four closest disciples:\n\nHis 4 main disciples were:\n\nPadmapada,\nTotakacharya,\nHasta Malaka,\nSureshvara.\n\nPadmapada\n\nPadmapada, one of Adi Shankaracharya\u2019s most ardent students, was born there. Sanandana, according to historical accounts, was drying his master\u2019s garments on the Ganges River\u2019s banks.\n\nSanandana began to cross the mighty Ganges while Shankaracharya begged for his clothes, holding his master\u2019s attire close to his bosom.\n\nTotakacharya\n\nHe was born in Giri and was an Adi Shankaracharya follower. The other Shankaracharya pupils thought Giri was a fool since he was completely devoted to his master\u2019s mission and showed no interest in academics.\n\nPadmapada persuaded his teacher to begin teaching him while Shankaracharya waited for Giri because he believed it would be a waste of time. Then Shankaracharya decided to honor Giri\u2019s devotion by giving him access to all of his knowledge.\n\nGiri earned the moniker Totakacharya for his poetry \u201cTotakashtakam.\u201d The Vadakke Modam monastery, today known as the Vadakke Madom temple, was built in Thrissur by Totakacharya.\n\nHasta Malaka\n\nA Brahmin called Prabhakara met Shankaracharya with his little son at a village close to Kollur (Karnataka). Prabhakara, the father\u2019s son, warned him that his father\u2019s child is a psychopath with no redeeming qualities.\n\nWhen Shankaracharya saw his child, he inquired as to what the child was doing. The small child responded by explaining Advaita philosophy in detail.\n\nHe was given the name Hasta Malaka by Shankaracharya and accepted as a student.\u00a0\n\nSureshwara\u00a0\n\nSureshvara first lived the life of a typical homeowner. Misra, the foremost practitioner of Nirakara Mimamsa, was close to Shankaracharya. At some point, Mandana Misra was met by Shankaracharya and challenged to a discussion.\n\nAfter months of debate, Mandana Misra finally conceded and consented to become Shankaracharya\u2019s pupil. He built the \u201cNaduvil Matham\u201d at Thrissur, under the name Sureshvara.\n\nContributions of Adi Shankaracharya\nPhilosophical contributions\nCreated the \u201cShanmata\u201d system of six sects of worship, which highlighted the five principal gods: Vishnu, Siva, Shakti, Muruka, Ganesha, and Surya.\nRestored the dasanami structure (Dashanami Sampradaya), in which monks were arranged under ten titles, and strengthened the sannyasa tradition.\nLiterary contributions\nComposed 72 devotional and meditative hymns like Soundarya Lahari, Sivananda Lahari, Nirvana Shalkam, etc.\nHe authored books on the fundamentals of Advaita Vedanta including VivekaChudamani, AtmaBodha, VaakyaVritti, and UpadesaSahasri.\nWrote 18 commentaries on the major scriptural texts including the Brahma Sutras, the Bhagavad Gita, and 12 major Upanishads.\nHis review of \u2018Brahma Sutra\u2019 is known as \u2018Brahmasutrabhasya\u2019, and it is the oldest surviving commentary on \u2018Brahma Sutra\u2019.\nHealing of a religion\nBy the time Shankara was born, Hinduism was in retreat and was paralyzed by its rigid practice of orthodoxy, ritualism, and formality.\nThe ascetic Mahavira Jaina (c. 599 BCE-527 BCE) and Gautama Buddha (c. 563 BCE-483 BCE), whose adherents split off into new religions that were independent of Mimamsa Brahminism, which was practiced by the majority of Hindus, presented a threat to it.\nAdi Shankara\u2019s Advaita Vedanta, which combined various ideas and Hindu practices into a philosophy based on the Vedic maxim \u201cOne Truth, Many Expositions,\u201d was the theoretically robust response to that period of chaos.\nFour ashrams\n\n\u00a0He established 4 ashrams in four corners of India.\n\nJyotirMatha in Badrinath, Uttarakhand \u2013 It advocates \u2018Ayamatma Brahma\u2019 (This Atman is Brahman) and was formed based on Atharva Veda. Totakacharya was the head of this matha\n\nGovardhana Matha in Puri, Odisha -part of the famous Jagannath temple, it advocates \u2018Prajnanam Brahma\u2019 (Consciousness is Brahman). It was formed based on Rig Veda. Padmapada was made the head of this monastery.\n\nKarnataka\u2019s Sringeri Matha is located there. It was founded on the principles of the Yajur Veda and is situated along the Tunga River\u2019s banks. Its motto is \u201cAhamBrahmasmi\u201d (I Am Brahman). This matha\u2019s leader was appointed as Sureshvara.\n\nThe Sarada Matha in Dwarka, Gujarat, was founded on the principles of the Sama Veda and promotes the idea of \u201cTattvamasi\u201d (That thou art). The leader of this matha was appointed Totakacharya.\n\nRelevance of Adi Shankaracharya in Today\u2019s world\nIt is necessary for this spiritual knowledge to diffuse from the mountainsides into the towns, cities, and villages\u2014but most importantly, into the hearts and minds of people.\nIt is past time to revive this culture, this piety, and this attitude of humility, which has benefited us greatly. We must learn to lower ourselves.\nThis has been our strength, our path, the process and method of our development and realization.\nHe constructed \u201cChaturamnaya peethas,\u201d or monastic institutions, in each of India\u2019s four directions. And he may have been the first person to employ a structural and institutional framework to unify our entire nation, much before the British.\nIn addition to codifying their powers and responsibilities, he created intricate selection processes for spiritual leaders to fill these pontifical offices, which are still used today.\nFew philosophers have created institutions and ensured their long-term sustainability without the aid of political or military backers. This is possibly Shankara\u2019s most impressive accomplishment.\n\nAccording to Adi Shankaracharya, the nirguna brahman can be defined in any way and is identical to the most aggressive personality, God.\n\nHe became well-known as one of the best Vedic teachers in the short time of his 32-year existence.\n\nOnly by using spirituality and a thorough comprehension of the universe was he able to accomplish this achievement. Shankara, Lord Shiva\u2019s manifestation, is highly regarded.\n\nMore than any other spiritual leader, Adi Shankaracharya is considered a philosopher and preacher who had a significant impact on Hinduism.\n\nIn the course of his life, he is credited for bringing together the various Hindu religious factions, founding organizations in all four corners of the nation, penning all significant religious treatises, and establishing Sanatan Dharma practices through discourse.\n\nTo read more about other social reformers Sree Narayana Guru, click here\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

One early morning, while Guru Nanak Dev was taking a bath in \u201cVain Nadi,\u201d a little river, he received a call from God to devote himself entirely to serve people .\n\nGuru Nanak Dev completed four significant spiritual trips over the following 30 years, traveling around 30,000 kilometres across India, South Asia, Tibet, and Arabia with Bhai Mardana by his side.\n\nGuru Nanak Dev and religionism\n\nHe preached the new definition of God during these journeys: \u201cSupreme, All-Powerful and Truthful, Formless (Nirankar), Fearless (Nirbhau), Without Hatred (Nirvair), the Sole (Ik), the Self-Existent (Saibhang), the Incomprehensible and Everlasting Creator of All Things (Karta Purakh), and the Eternal and Absolute Truth (Satnam).\u201d\n\nGuru taught people that all of God\u2019s creations include the \u201cOne\u201d God and that everyone has direct access to God without the need for priests or ceremonies.\n\nGuru Nanak Dev opposed the stronghold of the Hindu Caste System and denounced the theocracy of the Mughal emperors, erecting a distinctive spiritual, social, and political platform founded on equality and fraternal love.\n\nHe warned the crowd about the perils of egotism, deception, and hypocrisy while urging them to express their worship through the \u201cNaam\u201d (God\u2019s name).\n\nHis emphasis was on a householder\u2019s (family) life centred on moral behaviour, selfless service (Sewa), and ongoing devotion to the memory of God\u2019s name. He opposed the road of renunciation (Tyaga).\n\nAsserting the equality of women was a particular focus of Guru Nanak Dev\u2019s advocacy for human equality and the issues of the oppressed and the underprivileged.\n\nGuru founded and made his home in the Punjabi township of Kartarpur, also known as the \u201ccreator\u2019s town,\u201d in the last years of his life.\n\nHe put on the garb of a peasant here and worked the field to make an honest living for himself. People from near and far gathered to hear the master\u2019s speech.\n\nAt Kartarpur, he established the Langar (free communal kitchen) institution, establishing the fundamental equality of all individuals regardless of their social or economic status.\n\nTeachings Of Guru Nanak Dev\n\nGuru Nanak Dev founded and formalized the three pillars of Sikhism:\n\nNaam Japna:\n\nSimran and Naam Japna are practices that Guru introduced the Sikhs to first. Simran is a form of meditation on God that involves repeating, chanting, singing, and persistent remembering, followed by in-depth study and comprehension of God\u2019s Name and attributes.\nTo pursue and walk the path of Dharam (righteousness) in actual life, the Sikh\u2019s inner mind is therefore perpetually engulfed in adoration and awe of the Creator and the ONE ETERNAL GOD Waheguru.\n\nKirat Karni:\u00a0\n\nHe expected the Sikhs to practice Kirat Karni, which means to honestly earn money via physical and mental labour while accepting both pleasures and sorrows as God\u2019s gifts and blessings.\nOne is to stay truthful at all times and fear none but the Eternal Super Soul.\nLive a life founded on decency immersed in Dharam \u2013 a life controlled by high spiritual, moral, and social values.\n\nVand Chakna:\u00a0\n\nThe Sikhs were asked to share their wealth within the community by practicing Vand Chakna \u2013 \u201cShare and consume together\u201d.\nAn essential component of Sikhism is the Sadh Sangat or community. One must be a part of a group that upholds the ideals that the Sikh Gurus set out, and each Sikh is required to give back to the group in whatever way they can.\nSikhism also lays a lot of importance on charity and selfless service.\nMany concepts of Hinduism are also seen in Sikhism such as the concept of Maya, Kali Yuga, Jivamukta (salvation), reincarnation, and karma.\nMany believe Sikhism to be a bridge between Hinduism and Islam.\nGuru Nanak Dev denounced idol worship and pilgrimages.\nLessons from Guru Nanak Dev\n1. Never Forget the Poor\n\nThis mantra was held in 1500, a time before the idea of poverty alleviation, and it is true today when poverty still exists in many parts of the world.\n\nAt the age of 12, Guru Nanak Dev\u2019s father gave him Rs. 20 to start a company. Nanak purchased food for 20 rupees and distributed it.\n\nNanak explained to his father that this investment was a \u201creal business\u201d when he questioned him about it.\n\nToday, a Gurudwara named Sacha Sauda (true business) exists, where Guru Nanak Dev fed the poor.\n\n2. There is one God\n\nIt is terrible to classify people based on their religious beliefs. \u201cThere is neither Hindu nor Muslim,\u201d the Guru said.\n\nHe observed folks in Hardiwar offering Ganges water toward the sun in the east as a sacrifice to their departed ancestors in heaven. He started tossing water in that direction.\n\n3. Women are Equal to Men\n\nGuru Nanak Dev allowed women to attend religious gatherings and freely laud God at a period when other Indian religions demanded quiet, demure women in the temple and no women in the mosque.\n\n4. Running Away to a Forest Won\u2019t Give You Enlightenment\n\n\u201c\u2026Remember the essence of religion/ is meekness and sympathy/ But a life of goodness and purity/ amid the world\u2019s temptations\u2026\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013 Guru Nanak Dev Ji\n\nIn the past, perhaps, one could find enlightenment in the woods, but not anymore. Furthermore, Guru Nanak doesn\u2019t even demand that you do anything.\n\nHe thought that staying at home was preferable to leaving for the pursuit of the ultimate truth. Even after attaining knowledge, Nanak continued to be a farmer.\n\n5. These Five Evils are Probably Ruining Your Life\n\n1. Ego\n2. Anger\n3. Greed\n4. Attachment\n5. Lust.\n\nMost, if not all, the suffering of big city life comes from these five evils.\n\n6. Find Your Guru\n\nTo learn how to live morally, you need a mentor. According to Guru Nanak Dev, practicing righteousness is far preferable to traveling to holy places.\n\n7. Be Selfless\n\nEvery single day, more than 100,000 people of different faiths are fed at the Golden Temple in Punjab. It is a religious obligation, not because there is some sort of divine advantage.\n\nThe idea of unselfish service was a way of life for Nanak.\n\n8. Fight Superstition of Any Kind\n\nNanak spent his entire life challenging formal procedures, caste, and traditions that were absurd. By removing the clutter of what society tells you to do, you may find meaning and purpose in your own life in the simplest possible way.\n\n9. Simplicity is Beautiful\n\nIt is not hard to practice the tenets of Sikhism. There are only three:\n\ni.\u00a0Vand Chako:\u00a0Sharing with others\n\nii.\u00a0Kirat Karo:\u00a0Making an honest living\n\niii.\u00a0Naam Japna:\u00a0Remembering God at all times\n\n10. Travel\n\n\u00a0Your travels will benefit you greatly. At a time when religious leaders didn\u2019t leave their communities, Guru Nanak Dev travelled by foot to Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Ladakh, and Tibet.\n\nGuru Nanak Dev: Rise of the Sikh Power\nSikhism was founded by Guru Nanak Dev at the beginning of the sixteenth century.\nHe was always prone to profound thought and had no interest in everyday living. Upon turning thirty, he attained enlightenment.\nAfter that, he preached his message while traveling virtually the entire nation and crossing into Mecca and Baghdad. He was succeeded by nine further Gurus in succession after his death.\n\u00a0Guru Angad Dev Ji (1504-1552) was Guru for thirteen years (1539-1552). He created a new script Gurmukhi and gave the Sikhs a written language.\nAfter his death, Guru Amar Das Ji (1479-1574) followed in succession.He showed great devotion and made the langar an integral part of Sikhism.\nGuru Ram Das Ji took over as the fourth Guru, he composed hymns, which were later incorporated into the sacred writings.\nGuru Arjan Dev Ji was elected as the fifth Sikhism guru. In Amritsar, he constructed the renowned Harmandar Sahib, also called the Golden Temple.\nAdditionally, he wrote the holy Granth Sahib, a Sikh holy book. After the martyrdom of Guru Arjan Dev in 1606 came Siri Guru Hargobind(sixth guru), who had a standing army and symbolically donned two swords, signifying spiritual and material authority.\nGuru Siri Har Rai, the seventh Guru was born in 1630 and spent most of his life in devotional meditation and preaching the teachings of Guru Nanak.\nHe passed away in 1661 and ordained his second son, Harkishan as the Guru. Guru Siri Har Krishan Ji got enlightenment in 1661.\nHe died while helping and mending Delhi\u2019s epidemic-stricken residents. He passed away in Delhi, at the well-known Gurdwara Bangla Sahib, which is located there. In 1664, Siri Guru Tegh Bahadur attained guru status.\nGuru Tegh Bahadur decided to fight when the Mughal Governor of Kashmir used coercion to convert Hindus. Delhi\u2019s Gurdwara Sisganj and Gurdwara Rakabganj are located at the locations of Guru Sahib\u2019s martyrdom and cremation, respectively.\nThe tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, was born in 1666 and became Guru after the martyrdom of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur.\nWhen Guru Gobind Singh passed away, he invested the \u201cGuru Granth Sahib\u201d as the Sikhs\u2019 supreme leader, effectively ending the practice of choosing a religious leader.\n\nRead more about Adi Shankaracharya click here.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

The same was the case with John Ruskin\u2019s \u2018Unto This Last\u2019.\n\nGandhiji paraphrased Ruskin\u2019s book \u2018Unto This Last\u2019 as \u2018Sarvodaya\u2019, which meant the upliftment of all.\n\nThe goal of Gandhi was to change society and each individual using the values of honesty and nonviolence.\n\nThese ideas were further developed by many followers of Gandhi who proudly called themselves \u201cGandhians\u201d.\n\nThose who actively followed Gandhian principles in life include Vinoba Bhave,\u00a0 Jayaprakash Narayan, and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nAlso read: Acharya Vinoba Bhave\n\nImportant Gandhian Philosophies\n1. Truth and Non-Violence\n\nThese are generally considered to be the two key ingredients of Gandhian thought.\n\nIt is possible to pursue one without the other. Thus, seeking the truth can be done violently. Nations enter conflicts assuming they are on the side of truth or that the truth is on their side.\n\nThose who are more sensitive and think the truth is on their side demand that a just war should be fought instead of one that is avoided at all costs.\n\nThe most sensitive were the pacifists among them. By avoiding violence altogether. But it could be argued that in doing so they have gone too far and abandoned truth, especially when interpreted as justice.\n\nEven Mahatma Gandhi argued that although he was opposed to war, the two parties engaging in it may not stand on the same plane: the cause of one side could be more just than the other so that even a nonviolent person might wish to extend his or her moral support to one side rather than to the other.\n\nThus just as it is possible to pursue truth without being nonviolent, it is also possible to pursue nonviolence without pursuing truth.\n\nIt could be proposed that such a disjunction between the two runs the risk of cowardice being mistaken for, or masquerading as nonviolence.\n\nThe point becomes clear if we take the word \u201ctruth\u201d to denote the \u201cright\u201d thing to do in a morally charged situation.\n\nGANDHI\u2019S OPINION ON THE NON-VIOLENT WAY\n\nBy using a non-violent approach, we aim to eliminate capitalism, not the capitalist. We encourage the investor to think of himself as a trustee for people who rely on him to create, hold onto, and grow his capital.\n\nThe worker is not required to wait for his conversion. Work is power if money is. Both are depending upon one another.\n\nThe moment the worker recognizes his potential, he is in a position to stop being the capitalist\u2019s slave and start sharing in his success.\n\nIf he aims at becoming the sole owner, he will most likely be killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.\n\nNo need for me to worry that someone will replace me if I refuse to cooperate. Because I hope to persuade my co-workers to oppose my employer\u2019s wrongdoing, This method of mass worker education is undoubtedly a slow one, but as it is also the most reliable, it must also be the fastest.\n\nIt is simple to show in the end that the worker is right and that no human being is so flawless as to merit his eliminating the person whom he mistakenly believes to be completely evil.\n\n2. Satyagraha\n\nThe concept was introduced in the early 20th century by Mahatma Gandhi and designated a determined but nonviolent resistance to evil.\n\nThe supreme idea of truth naturally leads to the Gandhian ideology of Satyagraha. Protecting the standards and tenets of truth is essential if it is the ultimate reality. God, who is the utmost truth and reality, requires a votary who is completely compassionate and unselfish.\n\nGandhi\u2019s Satyagraha became a major tool in the Indian struggle against British imperialism and has since been adopted by protest groups in other countries.\n\nThe ancient Indian philosophy of ahimsa, or \u201cnon-injury,\u201d which is rigorously practised by Jains, many of whom reside in Gujarat, where Gandhi was raised, is the inspiration behind Satyagraha.\n\nGandhi also drew inspiration from the works of Leo Tolstoy and Henry David Thoreau, the Bible, and the Bhagavad Gita, on which he produced a commentary, to modernize the notion of ahimsa and give it broad political implications as Satyagraha.\n\nGandhi first conceived Satyagraha in 1906 in response to a law discriminating against Asians that was passed by the British colonial government of the Transvaal in South Africa.\n\nIn 1917, the Champaran district, which produced indigo, hosted the first Satyagraha campaign in India. Fasting and economic boycotts were used as Satyagraha tactics in India over the ensuing years, up until the British left in 1947.\n\nSince Satyagraha depends on the opponent, who is the embodiment of evil, upholding a high standard of ethical conduct, and demands an unreasonably high level of commitment from those working for social change, critics of the movement have asserted that it is unrealistic and incapable of achieving universal success.\n\nThese arguments have been made both during Gandhi\u2019s lifetime and since.\n\nHowever, Satyagraha left a lasting legacy in South Asia and was a key component of the civil rights movement headed by Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States.\n\n3. Sarvodaya\n\nThe word \u201cSarvodaya\u201d means \u201cUniversal Uplift\u201d or \u201cProgress of All.\u201d The phrase was first used by Mohandas Gandhi to describe the aim of his political philosophy in his 1908 translation of \u201cUnto This Last,\u201d a work by John Ruskin on political economy.\n\nLater Gandhians adopted the phrase as a moniker for the social movement in post-independence India that worked to ensure that self-determination and equality reached all strata of Indian society, including the Indian nonviolence leader Vinoba Bhave.\n\nOBJECTS OF THE SARVODAYA MOVEMENT\n\nThe Sarvodaya Movement has as its target the establishment of a whole network of such self-supporting village communities.\n\n\u00a0Family ties, which are currently restricted to blood groups, will be extended to include the entire village, erasing any disparities based on race, creed, caste, language, and other factors.\n\nThe planning of agriculture will ensure that there is enough food for everyone. Up until everyone in the hamlet has a job, the industry will operate on a cottage basis.\n\nVillage Council, a body that represents the entire village, will be responsible for determining the requirements of the community.\n\nPRINCIPLES OF THE SARVODAYA\nThere is no centralized authority, and there is a political and economic atmosphere in the villages.\n\u00a0The spirit of love, fraternity, truth, nonviolence, and self-sacrifice will permeate all people. The foundation of society will be nonviolence.\nThere will be no party system and majority rule and society will be free from the evil of the tyranny of the majority.\nSocialist in the truest sense, the Sarvodaya society. The same ethical, social, and financial standards will apply to all calls. The greatest potential for development exists within each person\u2019s personality.\n\u00a0Sarvodaya society is based on equality and liberty. There is no room in it for unwholesome competition, exploitation, and class hatred.\nSarvodaya is a symbol of universal progress. Every person should work independently and adhere to the concept of non-possession. The goal of: from each according to his effort and each according to his needs will then be achievable.\nThere won\u2019t be any private property, which serves as a weapon of exploitation and a breeding ground for prejudice and hatred. Similar to how the profit motive will vanish, rent and interest will also disappear.\nThe Sarvodaya Movement is based on Truth, nonviolence, and Self-denial.\nThe Sarvodaya Movement makes an earnest and audacious effort to foster the environment required to unite such people with steadfast trust in the Welfare of All.\nThe benefit to the person would be little. Each quality\u2019s growth is dependent on every other quality. If every quality were somewhat enhanced, the person would benefit more.\n4. Swadeshi\n\nThe combination of two Sanskrit terms yields the English word \u201cSwadeshi,\u201d which has Sanskrit roots. Swa and desh both refer to one\u2019s own or one\u2019s nation.\n\nSwadesh, therefore, refers to one\u2019s homeland. The adjectival version of the word swadeshi, which means \u201cof one\u2019s own country,\u201d can be loosely translated as \u201cself-sufficiency\u201d in most settings.\n\nTHE MESSAGE OF THE CHARKHA\n\nGandhiji asserts that the Charkha has the distinction of being able to address the issue of economic distress in a way that is most logical, straightforward, affordable, and professional.\n\nIt stands for both the wealth and freedom of the country. It represents commercial peace rather than commercial strife.\n\nThe spinning-meaning wheel is considerably bigger than its diameter. Simple life, helping others, living without hurting others, and forging an unbreakable tie between the wealthy and the poor, capital and labour, and the prince and the peasant are all part of its teachings. Naturally, the bigger lesson applies to everyone.\n\n5. Trusteeship\n\nTrusteeship is a key component of Gandhian economics that could be called the nonviolent equivalent of ownership.\n\nThe idea was taken from English law by Gandhi. It denotes that one is a trustee rather than the owner of their belongings, including eventually their skills or abilities.\n\nAll must be used for the greater good of society, which includes one\u2019s own welfare in the end. In this system, material possessions do not serve as status symbols that increase our sense of self-worth.\n\nTrusteeship is a successful strategy for reducing excessive consumption. The economy might be rebalanced under trusteeship and put its focus back on pressing needs.\n\nGandhi believed that possessing more than one need necessarily entails robbing others of their requirements. There is enough on the earth to meet everyone\u2019s needs, but not enough to satisfy everyone\u2019s greed, he said.\n\nThe relevance of Gandhian Philosophy in Modern Times\nEconomics\n\nMake in India is a manifestation of Gandhi\u2019s ideals of self-sufficiency.\n\nGandhi\u2019s philosophy of inclusive growth is fundamental to the building of a resurgent rural India.\n\nHe believed in \u201cproduction by the masses\u201d rather than in mass production, a distinctive feature of the industrial revolution.\n\nEnvironment\n\n\u00a0Gandhi warned the country of unrestricted industrialism and exploitation of nature for human greed.\n\nThe results of not adhering to Gandhian environmentalism are serious environmental damage and non-sustainable development.\n\nAdministration\n\nBy emulating Gandhi\u2019s values of non-violence and Satyagraha, internal matters such as insurgency issues in Kashmir, central India, or the North-Eastern states might be handled much better.\n\nInternational\n\nEven India\u2019s foreign policy is founded on peaceful coexistence, and this is seen in the fact that India does not engage in aggression initially, even when security threats mount.\n\nTo conclude we can say that most of the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi hold relevance even in today\u2019s world.\n\nSeven Social Sins by Mahatma Gandhi\n\nSeven Social Sins by Mahatma Gandhi were first published in his newspaper Young India in 1925. Those are a comprehensive list of behaviours that cause serious harm to society.\n\n1. Wealth without Work\n\n2. Pleasure without Conscience\n\n3. Knowledge without Character\n\n4. Commerce (Business) Without Morality (Ethics)\n\n5. Science without Humanity\n\n6. Religion without Sacrifice\n\n7. Politics without Principle\n\nWealth without Work:\u00a0It depicts making wealth by unfair means, by taking shortcuts. Examples: Black Money, Tax evasion, scams, insider trading, etc.\nPleasure without Conscience:\u00a0Earning happiness at the expense of others is equivalent to sin. Selfishness compels a person to disregard the needs of others. Without moral justification, it would promote bad practices. Additionally, it would lead to a rise in drug and alcohol abuse as well as mindless shopping.\nKnowledge without character:\u00a0A person with character possesses attributes of honesty and integrity. A person who commits this vice may end up like Osama Bin Laden, while a person with moral character may end up like Swami Vivekananda.\nBusiness without morality:\u00a0One particular segment of the community would end up being overworked at the expense of another. Social friction and community conflict would rise as a result of this. Examples of this sin include unsafe working conditions, adulteration, and lack of security.\nScience without humanity:\u00a0The huge pharmaceutical companies keep prescription prices high, making them unaffordable for the poor and those in need. If nuclear power is utilized to generate electricity, that is great, but using it to destroy nations like Hiroshima and Nagasaki by bombing is utterly immoral.\nReligion without sacrifice:\u00a0Today\u2019s religion consists merely of rituals and activities. Sin is when we fail to live out the moral precepts of brotherhood, compassion, and affection.\nPolitics without principle:\u00a0Criminalization of politics, unaccounted money, and use of muscle power shows politics without principle.\n\nTo read more about Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s biography click here.\n\nArticle Written by: Remya"

After the battle of talikota, Bijapur seized the Raichur doab and later annexed Bidar in 1619.\n\nLater in the 17th century, under Shivaji\u2019s leadership, the Marathas successfully seized control of the sultanate\u2019s capital, Bijapur, as well as several other key locations.\n\nWith the fall of Bijapur in 1686, Aurangzeb overthrew the ailing sultanate, ending the dynasty.\n\nAhmednagar sultanate\n\nMalik Ahmed Shah Bahri founded the Ahmednagar Sultanate on May 28, 1490, after defeating the Bahmani Army under Jahangir Khan, also known as the Nizam Shahi dynasty.\n\nIn the northwest corner of the Deccan plateau, between the sultanates of Gujarat and Bijapur, lay the domain of the Ahmednagar Sultanate.\n\nThe Nizam Shahi dynasty\u2019s initial capital was Junnar, but Bahri later lay the cornerstone for the new city, Ahmednagar, in the year 1494.\n\nSultan Murtaza Shah annexed Berar in 1574.\n\nChand Bibi defended the Nizam Shahi dynasty against the Mughal attack in 1596.

He was kidnapped by Bahmani soldiers as a young boy and converted to Islam.\n\nHe was the governor of Berar when the Bahmani sultanate fell; he declared independence and founded the Imad Shahi dynasty.

Later, he moved south to the Deccan and worked for Mohammed Shah I of Bahman.\n\nAfter the Bahmani sultanate fell apart in 1518, Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk seized Golconda and was appointed the region\u2019s ruler of Telangana.

And the empire now encompassed the whole of south India from Krishna- Tungabhadra plains up to Rameshwaram.\n\nThe Bahmani kingdom came into being in 1347 and was involved on constant conflicts with Vijayanagara. Major causes of conflict with the Bahmanis:\n\nRaichur Doab-between Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers\nFertile delta of Krishna Godavari\nKonkan strip between the Western Ghats and the sea (ports like Goa facilitated trade-import of horses from Arala)\nSangama dynasty (1336-1485)\n\nHarihara 1 ruled from 1336 to 1356, and gained control over most of the area south of the\u00a0Tungabhadra River\u00a0and earned the title of \u201cmaster of the eastern and western seas\u201d (Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara).\n\nAfter his death, his brother Bukka Raya I took over in 1356 and ruled till 1377.\n\nIn 1367, Bukka I launched an assault on the Mudkal fortress.

It is well known that he supported and fostered many cults as well as their places of worship.\n\nHe rebuilt Shiva sanctuaries such as the Virupaksha Temple.\nThe temples of Tirumala, Srisailam, Amaravati, Chidambaram, Ahobilam, and Tiruvannamalai received land grants from him.\nHe lavishly bestowed various expensive items on the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple.\n\nMany foreign travelers visited the kingdom and wrote praises of the city and administration- Ibn batuta, Nicolo de Conti, Abdul Razzak, Barossa, Domingos Paes, and Nuniz.\n\nKrishnadeva Raya died in 1529 due to illness and was succeeded by his brother Achyuta Deva Raya (1529-1543).\n\nSadahshiva Raya (1543-1565) was the last Tuluva ruler of the Vijayanagara kingdom. His administration was controlled by a triumvirate led by Rama Raja.\n\nRama Raja entered into a commercial treaty with the Portuguese and stopped the supply of horses to Bijapur.\nThis move weakened the sultanates-Bijapur, Golconda and Ahmadnagar were defeated.\n\nIn 1565, the three kingdoms united and attacked Vijayanagara which became to known as the Battle of Talikota or Rakhsha-Tangadi.\n\nRama Raja was executed and the city of Vijayanagara was looted and destroyed.\nThe glorious city was abandoned after the destruction of the battle.\n\nThe Vijayanagara empire was more or less destroyed after the Battle of Talikota but the kingdom remained till the 1640s.\n\nAravidu dynasty (1542-1646): Last dynasty of Vijayanagara\n\nAliya Rama Raja belonged to the dynasty and his brother Tirumala Deva Raya took over the throne after the former\u2019s death in battle.\n\nAll the rulers of the dynasty kept trying to restore the city of Vijayanagara but were marred by constant attacks from the Muslim neighbors. This kept on weakening the kingdom.\n\nVenkatapati Deva Raya\u2019s (1586-1614), reign saw a gain of strength as he successfully dealt with the Deccan sultans and restored much of the kingdom as well.\n\nAround 1592 Venkatapati shifted his capital from\u00a0Penukonda\u00a0to\u00a0Chandragiri, which was further south near the\u00a0Tirupathi\u00a0hills.\nAfter 1604, he shifted the capital from Chandragiri to Vellore Fort, which was used as a major base.\n\nThe Dutch in 1608 sought permission to set up a factory in Pulicat during his rule.\n\nHe died in 1614 and his nephew Sriranga II took over the rule. But he and his family were murdered by rival factions as a struggle for the throne ensued.\n\nHis son Rama deva Raya (1617-1632), who was smuggled out by a faithful commander during murders, took over the rule after the long-drawn battle. His rule was marred by constant battles with the rival factions.\n\nThe last ruler of the dynasty and Vijayanagara empire was Sriranga III (1642-1652). He kept losing territories to the Nayaks and Deccan sultans and by the time of his death was a king without a kingdom.\n\nThus ended three centuries of Viajaynagara rule in South India.\n\nThe Vijayanagara empire had a significant impact on the culture, language, architecture, and literature of the time.\n\nNumerous languages like Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, and Tamil literature flourished.\nThe temple architecture with tall gopurams and Kalyana mandapams was prominent (Vithala, Virupaksha temple, Hampi; Varadharaja, Ekamparantha temples, Kanchipuram).\n\nAlso read: Medieval Indian History Books and Authors\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

The kingdom was converted to Hinduism over the centuries, and it became a multi-ethnic culture.\n\nThey ruled for about 600 years and no attack on them was successful during this period, hence they largely remained independent.\n\nThe Ahoms expanded their territory in the 16th century under Suhunmung (1497-1539).\n\nThe Hinduization of Ahoms is marked by Suhungmung changing his name to Svarga Narayana.\nBengal Sultan Nusrat Shah attacked Ahoms but was defeated and repulsed.\n\nVaishnavite reformer Sankardev (born in Nagaon district, Assam) lived during this time (1449-1568). He played an important role in the spread of Vaishnavism in Assam. He and his followers established Sattras (monasteries), where the Sattriya dance form originated.\n\nAlso read:\u00a0Lachit Borphukan: Assam\u2019s Braveheart\n\nThe regional kingdom of Odisha\n\nDuring medieval times,\u00a0the Hindu Gajapati rulers (1435 \u2013 1541 CE) ruled over Kalinga (Odisha), large parts of Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal, and the eastern and central parts of Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand.\n\nKapilendra Deva founded the Gajapati dynasty in 1453 CE after the decline of the\u00a0eastern Ganga dynasty.\n\nThey spread their control over Karnataka in the south, which put them at odds with Vijayanagara, the Reddis, and the Bahmani sultans.\n\nHowever, by the early 16th century, Vijaynagara and Golconda had gained control of substantial areas of the southern empire, and the Gajapati dynasty had even given way to the Bhoi dynasty.\n\nKingdom of Gujarat\n\nGujarat was one of the richest provinces of the Delhi Sultanate as it was rich in soil and handicrafts, and had sea ports for trade.\n\nDuring Firuz Tughlaq\u2019s reign, Zafar Khan was governor of Gujarat.\n\nAfter Timur\u2019s invasion, Gujarat and Malwa became de facto independent sultanates.\n\nMuzaffirid dynasty\n\nIn 1407, Zafar Khan formally proclaimed the independent Gujarat Sultanate and took up the title Muzaffar Shah, as the official independent ruler of Gujarat. He ruled from Patan as the capital.\n\nAhmed Shah I (1411-1441):\n\nHe was the grandson of Zafar Khan and during his long tenure, he brought the nobility under control, settled the administration, and expanded and consolidated the kingdom.\nHe shifted the capital from Patan to the new city of\u00a0Ahmedabad\u00a0(its foundation was laid in 1413 CE).\nHe defeated Saurashtra and captured the strong fort of Girnar, but later restored it to the Raja, on his promise to pay tribute.\nAttacked the Hindu pilgrimage center of Sidhpur, and destroyed many beautiful temples.\nHe also imposed the Jizyah tax on Hindus for the first time in Gujarat.\nDespite these atrocities against Hindus, he appointed rich Hindu merchants like Manik Chand and Motichand, as ministers.\n\nMahmud Begarha (1459-1511):\n\nHe was the most\u00a0famous ruler\u00a0of Gujarat as the kingdom emerged as one of the most powerful states in the country.\nHe was called\u00a0Begarha\u00a0because he captured two important forts (garhs)- Girnar in Saurashtra (now Junagarh)\u00a0and\u00a0Champaner in south Gujarat.\nHe renamed Junagarh Mustafabad.\nHe captured the fort of Champaner which was important to control Malwa and Khandesh and constructed a new town called\u00a0Muhammadabad near Champaner.\nMahmud sacked Dwarka because it harbored pirates who preyed on the pilgrims traveling to Mecca.\nHe led an\u00a0expedition against the Portuguese\u00a0who were interfering with Gujarat\u2019s trade with the countries of West Asia. (Vasco da Gama arrived in India in 1498).\n1509: Battle of Diu fought by Mahmud\u2019s Gujarat Navy (led by Admiral Malik Ayyaz), Mamluk Egypt, Zamorin of Calicut, Ottoman Navy, Venice, and Ragusa (Croatia) against the Portuguese Navy. The Portuguese won decisively.\nPortuguese traveler Barbosa has written about the reign of Begarha.\n\nAkbar annexed Gujarat in 1573 CE hence ending the regional kingdom of the western trade route.\n\nRegional Kingdom of Malwa\n\n1392 Dilawar Khan Ghori who belonged to the court of Firoz Shah Tughlaq threw off his allegiance to Delhi and became independent.\n\nDilawar shifted the capital from\u00a0Dhar to Mandu, a place that was highly defensible and which had a great deal of natural beauty.\nDilawar Khan Ghori died in 1405 CE and was succeeded by his son, Alp Khan who assumed the title \u2018Hoshang Shah\u2019.\n\nMalwa sultanate was centered around Rivers Narmada and Tapi and as a buffer between Gujarat, Bahmanis, and Lodi Sultans of Delhi.\n\nHushang Shah (1406-1435):\n\nHushang Shah fought with Muzaffar Shah of Gujarat.\nNo restrictions were placed on the construction of temples, under Hushang Shah.\nHushang Shah extended his patronage to the Jains.\nThe Jahaz Mahal and Mandu Fort are fine examples of architecture of this time.\n\nMahmud Khalji (1436 \u2013 1469 CE):\n\nMahmud Khalji assassinated Mohammad, the son of Hoshang Shah, and ascended to the throne.\nHe fought with almost all his neighbors, the Bahmani Sultans, the ruler of Gujarat, the rajas of Gondwana and Orissa, and even the sultan of Delhi.\nHe fought with Rana Kumbha of Mewar and both the kingdoms claimed victory. Mahmud Khalji erected a seven-storied column at Mandu and Rana Kumbha raised a tower of victory in Chittoor.\n\nDuring the period 1531-1537 CE, Bahadur Shah controlled the kingdom, though the Mughal emperor Humayun captured it for a brief period in 1535- 36 CE.\n\nIn 1537 CE, Qadir Shah who belonged to the previous Khalji dynasty regained control over a part of the erstwhile kingdom.\n\nBut in c.1542 CE, Sher Shah Suri defeated him and captured the kingdom.\nHe appointed Shujat Khan as the governor and his son Baz Bahadur declared independence in 1555 CE.\n\nBaz Bahadur (c. 1551- 1561 CE):\n\nHe was the last sultan of Malwa. He was famous for his association with Queen Roopmati.\nIn 1561 CE, he was defeated by Akbar\u2019s army led by Pir Muhammad Khan and Adham Khan in the\u00a0battle of Sarangpur. Baz Bahadur fled to Khandesh.\nRegional kingdom of Mewar\n\nWith the conquest of Ranthambore by Alauddin Khalji, the power of Chauhans in Rajputana came to an end in the 14th century.\n\nIn 1335 CE, Rana Hammira (1314 \u2013 1378 CE) established the second Guhila dynasty of Chittor.\n\nHe was the progenitor of the Sisodia clan, a branch of the Guhilot clan, to which every succeeding Maharana of Mewar belonged.\nHe was the first ruler who started the use of the title \u201cRana\u201d and also built the Annapoorna Mata temple in Chittorgarh fort in Rajasthan.\nAfter the assassination of Rana Hamirra\u2019s grandson, Maharana Mokal, his son Rana Kumbha ascended the throne of Mewar.\n\nRana Kumbha (1433 \u2013 1468 CE):\n\nRana Kumbha made the kingdom of Mewar very powerful. After consolidating his position with great diplomacy and defeating his internal rivals, Kumbha conquered states like Bundi, Kotah, Dungarpur, etc.\nRana Kumbha gave shelter to a court rival of Mahmud Khalji of Malwa and even attempted to install him on the Malwa throne. In retaliation, Mahmud Khalji gave shelter to and sponsored some court rivals of Rana Kumbha.\n1448- Rana Kumbha constructed the Vijay Stambha at Chittorgarh, to commemorate his victory over the combined armies of Malwa and Gujarat led by Mahmud Khalji.\nHe was murdered by his son, Udai to gain the throne. He was, however, ousted by Maharana Raimal, the younger son of Rana Kumbha. Later, after another unfortunate, long conflict with his brothers, Rana Sanga (son of Raimal) became the ruler of Mewar.\n\nRana Sanga (c. 1508 \u2013 1528 CE):\n\nHe was the grandson of Rana Kumbha who established his supremacy over almost all Rajput states in Rajasthan.\n\nMahmud II, the king of Malwa, sought assistance from Bahadur Shah of Gujarat as well as Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi of Delhi because he was concerned about the influence of his rival Rajput Wazir Medini Rai.\n\nMedini Rai received assistance from Rana Sanga. Malwa\u2019s army was defeated, along with the supporting forces from Delhi, by Sanga\u2019s army and the Rajput rebels from within Malwa.\nMalwa thus came under Rana\u2019s control militarily. However, even after defeating and imprisoning Mahmud II, Rana Sanga treated him well and restored his realm.\n\nIn 1518, Battle of Khatoli, Rana Sangha defeated Ibrahim Lodi when he invaded Mewar.\n\nIn 1527 CE, Rana fought against Babur in the famous Battle of Khanwa (near Fatehpur Sikri).\n\nIn 1528 CE, he again fought Babur at the\u00a0Battle of Chanderi\u00a0to help Medini Rai who was attacked by Babur. But he fell sick and died in the camp.\n\nHence, these regional kingdoms ruled during the medieval time and eventually culminated in blending into a Mughal rule that followed Babur\u2019s arrival.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

He ruled in southern India during the Sangam period.\n\nImperial Cholas\n\nAfter the decline of the Sangam period, the Cholas became feudatories in Uraiyur. They became prominent in the ninth century and established an empire comprising the major portion of South India.\n\nThe founder of the Imperial Chola line was Vijayalaya Chola. He captured Tanjore from Muttaraiyars in 815 A.D. and built a temple for Durga.\n\nHis son Aditya Chola put an end to the Pallava kingdom by defeating Aparajita and annexing Tondaimandalam. Chola Country or Cholamandalam was the area bound by the Pennar on the North, the Vellaru River on the South, the Bay of Bengal on the East and Coorg on the West.\n\nParantaka I was one of the important imperial Chola rulers. He defeated the Pandyas and the ruler of Ceylon. In the famous battle of Takkolam Rashtrakutas defeated him. Parantaka I was a great builder of temples. He provided the golden roof of the Vimana of Nataraja Temple at Chidambaram.\n\nThe two famous Uttiramerur inscriptions give a detailed account of the village administration under the Cholas that belong to his reign.\n\nTheir capital was Tanjore. They also extended their sway in Sri Lanka and the Malay Peninsula. Therefore, they are called the Imperial Cholas. Thousands of inscriptions found in the temples provide detailed information regarding the administration, society, economy and culture of the Chola period.\n\nIt was under Rajaraja I and his son Rajendra I that the Chola power reached its highest point of glory.\n\nRajaraja I aka Ponniyil Selvon (985 \u2013 1014 A.D)\n\nRajaraja I is also known by the name Ponniyil Selvon.\n\nHis military conquests were:\n\nThe defeat of the Chera ruler Bhaskararavivarman in the naval battle of Kandalursalai and the destruction of the Chera navy.\nThe defeat of the Pandya ruler, Amarabhujanga and the establishment of Chola authority in the Pandya country.\nThe conquest of Gangavadi, Tadigaipadi and Nolambapadi located in the Mysore region.\nThe invasion of Sri Lanka was entrusted to his son Rajendra I. As the Sri Lankan king Mahinda V fled away from his country, the Cholas annexed northern Sri Lanka. The capital was shifted from Anuradhapura to Polanaruva where a Shiva temple was built\nThe Chola victory over the growing power of the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani. Satyasraya was defeated and Rajaraja I captured the Raichur Doab, Banavasi and other places. Hence the Chola power extended up to the river Tungabhadra.\nThe restoration of the Vengi throne to its rulers Saktivarman and Vimaladitya by defeating the Telugu Chodas. Rajaraja gave his daughter Kundavai in marriage to Vimaladitya.\nRajaraja\u2019s last military achievement was a naval expedition against the Maldive Islands which were conquered.\nAfter Rajaraja I\n\nThrough these conquests, the extent of the Chola empire under Rajaraja I included the Pandya, Chera and Tondaimandalam regions of Tamil Nadu and the Gangavadi, Nolambapadi and the Telugu Choda territories in the Deccan and the northern part of Ceylon and the Maldive Islands beyond India.\n\nRajaraja assumed a number of titles like Mummidi Chola, Jayankonda and Sivapadasekara. He was a devout follower of Saivism. Rajaraja completed the construction of the famous Rajarajeswara temple or Brihadeeswara temple at Tanjore in 1010 A.D. And also helped in the construction of a Buddhist monastery at Nagapattinam.\n\nRajendra I (1012-1044 A.D)\n\nRajendra demonstrated his military ability by participating in his father\u2019s campaigns. He continued his father\u2019s policy of aggressive conquests and expansion. His important wars were:\n\nMahinda V, the king of Sri Lanka attempted to recover from the Cholas in the northern part of Ceylon. Rajendra defeated him and seized southern Sri Lanka. Thus the whole of Sri Lanka was made part of the Chola Empire.\nHe reasserted the Chola authority over the Chera and Pandya countries.\nHe defeated Jayasimha II, the Western Chalukya king and the river Tungabadhra was recognised as the boundary between the Cholas and Chalukyas.\nHis most famous military enterprise was his expedition to north India. The Chola army crossed the Ganges by defeating a number of rulers on their way. Rajendra defeated Mahipala I of Bengal. To commemorate this successful north-Indian campaign Rajendra founded the city of Gangaikondacholapuram and constructed the famous Rajesvaram temple in that city. He also excavated a large irrigation tank called Cholagangam on the western side of the city.\nAnother famous venture of Rajendra was his naval expedition to Kadaram or Sri Vijaya. It is difficult to pinpoint the real object of the expedition. Whatever its objects were, the naval expedition was a complete success. A number of places were occupied by Chola forces. But it was only temporary and no permanent annexation of these places was contemplated. He assumed the title Kadaramkondan.\nRajendra I had put down all rebellions and kept his empire intact.\nAfter Rajendra I\n\nAt the death of Rajendra I the extent of the Chola Empire was at its peak. The river Tungabadhra was the northern boundary. The Pandya, Kerala and Mysore regions and also Sri Lanka formed part of the empire. He gave his daughter Ammangadevi to the Vengi Chalukya prince and further continued the matrimonial alliance initiated by his father.\n\nRajendra I assumed a number of titles, the most famous being Mudikondan, Gangaikondan, Kadaram Kondan and Pandita Cholan. Like his father, he was also a devout Saiva and built a temple for that god at the new capital Gangaikondacholapuram. He made liberal endowments to this temple and to the Lord Nataraja temple at Chidambaram. He was also tolerant of the Vaishnava and Buddhist sects.\n\nAfter Rajendra I, the greatness of the Chola power was preserved by rulers like Kulottunga I and Kulottunga III. Kulottunga I was the grandson of Rajendra I through his daughter Ammangadevi. He succeeded the Chola throne and thus united the Vengi kingdom with the Chola Empire. During his reign Sri Lanka became independent. Subsequently, Vengi and the Mysore region were captured by the western Chalukyas. Kulottunga I sent a large embassy of 72 merchants to China and maintained cordial relations with the kingdom of Sri Vijaya.\n\nUnder Kulottunga III the central authority became weak. The rise of the feudatories like the Kadavarayas and the emergence of the Pandya power as a challenge to Chola supremacy contributed to the ultimate downfall of the Chola Empire. Rajendra III was the last Chola king who was defeated by Jatavarman Sundarapandya II. The Chola country was absorbed into the Pandya Empire.\n\nLater Cholas\n\nAround the 7th century, a Chola kingdom flourished in present-day Andhra Pradesh. These Telugu Cholas traced their descent to the early Sangam Cholas. However, it is not known if they had any relation to the early Cholas.\n\nIt is possible that a branch of the Tamil Cholas migrated north during the time of the Pallavas to establish a kingdom of their own, away from the dominating influences of the Pandyas and Pallavas.\n\nThe Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, who spent several months in Kanchipuram during 639\u2013640 writes about the \u201ckingdom of Culi-ya\u201d, an apparent reference to these Telugu Cholas.\n\nSalient features of the Chola Administration:\nCentral Government of Chola:\n\nThe Cholas had an excellent system of administration. The emperor or king was at the top of the administration. The extent and resources of the Chola Empire increased the power and prestige of the monarchy.\n\nThe big capital cities like Tanjore and Gangaikondacholapuram, the large royal courts and extensive grants to the temples reveal the authority of the king. They undertook royal tours to increase the efficiency of the administration.\n\nThere was elaborate administrative machinery comprising various officials called perundanam and sirudanam. The balance between central control and local independence was maintained and non-interference in local government was sacrosanct\n\nRevenue:\n\nThe land revenue department was well organized. It was called puravuvarithinaikkalam. All lands were carefully surveyed and classified for assessment of revenue.\n\nThe residential portion of the village was called ur-nattam. These and other lands such as the lands belonging to temples were exempted from tax.\n\nBesides land revenue, there were tolls and customs on goods taken from one place to another, various kinds of professional taxes, dues levied on ceremonial occasions like marriages and judicial fines.\n\nDuring the hard times, there was a remission of taxes and Kulottunga I became famous by abolishing tolls and earned the title \u2013 Sungam Tavirtta Cholan.\n\nThe main items of government expenditure were the king and his court, army and navy, roads, irrigation tanks and canals.\n\nMilitary Administration of Chola:\n\nThe Cholas maintained a regular standing army consisting of elephants, cavalry, infantry and navy. About seventy regiments were mentioned in the inscriptions.\n\nThe royal troops were called Kaikkolaperumpadai. Within this, there was a personal troop to defend the king known as Velaikkarar. Attention was given to the training of the army and military cantonments called kadagams existed.\n\nThe Cholas paid special attention to their navy. The naval achievements of the Tamils reached their climax under the Cholas. They controlled the Malabar and Coromandal coasts. In fact, the Bay of Bengal became a Chola lake for some time.\n\nThe Chola king\u2019s retinue included the padimagalir \u2014 women bodyguards who protected and attended to the king. A verse describes a king\u2019s skin as covered with \u201chandsome scars\u201d (from battle) \u201cthat have grown together as if he were a tree with its bark stripped for use in curing.\u201d\n\nProvincial Administration of Chola:\n\nThe Chola Empire was divided into Mandalams and each Mandalam was into Valanadus and Nadus. In each Nadu there were a number of autonomous villages.\n\nThe royal princes or officers were in charge of Mandalams. The valanadu was under periyanattar and nadu under nattar. The town was known as Nagaram and it was under the administration of a council called Nagarattar.\n\nVillage autonomy:\n\nThe system of village autonomy with sabhas and their committees developed through the ages and reached its culmination during the Chola rule.\n\nTwo inscriptions belonging to the period of Parantaka I found at Uttiramerur provide details of the formation and functions of village councils. That village was divided into thirty wards and each was to nominate its members to the village council.\n\nThe qualifications to become a ward member were:\na. Ownership of at least one-fourth veli of the land.\nb. own residence.\nc. Above thirty years and below seventy years of age.\nd. Knowledge of Vedas.\n\nHowever, certain norms of disqualification were also mentioned in the inscriptions. They were:\na. Those who had been members of the committees for the past three years.\nb. Those who had failed to submit accounts as committee members.\nc. Those who had committed sins.\nd. Those who had stolen the property of others.\n\nOf the persons duly nominated, one was to be chosen for each ward by kudavolai system for a year. The names of eligible persons were written on palm leaves and put into a pot. A young boy or girl would take out thirty names each for one ward.\n\nThey were divided into six variyams such as samvatsaravariyam, erivariyam, thotta variyam, pancha variyam,pon variyam and puravuvari variyam to take up six different functions of the village administration.\n\nThe committee members were called Variyapperumakkal. They usually met in the temple or under a tree and passed resolutions. The number of committees and ward members varied from village to village.\n\nSocio-Cultural life:\n\nThe caste system was widely prevalent during the Chola period. Brahmins and Kshatriyas enjoyed special privileges. The inscriptions of the later period of the Chola rule mentioned two major divisions among the castes \u2013 Valangai and Idangai castes. However, there was cooperation among various castes and sub-castes in social and religious life.\n\nThe position of women did not improve. The practice of \u2018sati\u2019 was prevalent among the royal families. The devadasi system or dancing girls attached to temples emerged during this period.\n\nBoth Saivism and Vaishnavism continued to flourish during the Chola period. A number of temples were built with the patronage of Chola kings and queens. The temples remained centres of economic activity during this period. Mathas had a great influence during this period.\n\nEconomic Life:\n\nBoth agriculture and industry flourished. Reclamation of forest lands and the construction and maintenance of irrigation tanks led to agricultural prosperity. The weaving industry, particularly the silk-weaving at Kanchi flourished.\n\nThe metal works developed owing to the great demand for images for temples and utensils. Commerce and trade were brisk with trunk roads or peruvazhis and merchant guilds. Gold, silver and copper coins were issued in plenty in various denominations.\n\nCommercial contacts between the Chola Empire and China, Sumatra, Java and Arabia were extensively prevalent. Arabian horses were imported in large numbers to strengthen the cavalry.\n\nThe \u2018daughters of god,\u2019 the Devanar Makkal or temple women, had their names inscribed in temples for donations received in their names, and inscriptions suggest that Chola women had at least some control over the resources of their households. Women were witnesses and signatories for land grants to temples, as well as land transactions.\n\nProperty, when owned by the woman, could not be spent by her husband without her permission, temple inscriptions refer to cases where husbands were fined and asked to repay the wife for having sold her property without her knowledge.\n\nEducation and Literature:\n\nEducation was also given importance. Besides the temples and mathas as educational centres, several educational institutions also flourished.\n\nThe inscription at Ennayiram, Thirumukkudal and Thirubhuvanai provide details of the colleges that existed in these places. Apart from the Vedas and Epics, subjects like mathematics and medicine were taught in these institutions.\nThe endowment of lands was made to run these institutions. The development of Tamil literature reached its peak during the Chola period. Sivakasintamani written by Thiruthakkadevar and Kundalakesi belonged to the 10th century.\n\nThe Ramayana composed by Kamban and the Periyapuranam or Tiruttondarpuranam by Sekkilar is the two masterpieces of this age. Jayankondar\u2019s Kalingattupparani describes the Kalinga war fought by Kulotunga I.\n\nThe Moovarula written by Ottakuthar depicts the life of three Chola kings. The Nalavenba was written by Pugalendi. The works on Tamil grammar like Kalladam by Kalladanar, Yapperungalam by Amirthasagarar, a Jain, Nannul by Pavanandhi and Virasoliyam by Buddhamitra were the products of the Chola age.\n\nArt and Architecture:\n\nThe Dravidian style of art and architecture reached its perfection under the Cholas. They built enormous temples. The chief feature of the Chola temple is the vimana.\n\nThe early Chola temples were found at Narthamalai and Kodumbalur in Pudukottai district and at Srinivasanallur in Tiruchirappalli district. The Big Temple at Tanjore built by Rajaraja I is a masterpiece of South Indian art and architecture. It consists of the vimana, ardhamandapa, mahamandapa and a large pavilion in the front known as the Nandimandapa.\n\nAnother notable contribution made by the Cholas to temple architecture is the Siva temple at Gangaikondacholapuram built by Rajendra I.

Thus started the expansion of the Delhi sultanate\u2019s borders.\n\nIn 1321, he sent his eldest son Ulugh Khan (later known as Muhammad bin Tughlaq), to Deogir to plunder the Hindu kingdoms of Warangal. But this first attempt was a failure.\n\nFour months later, Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq sent large army reinforcements for his son asking him to attempt plundering Arangal and Tilang again and this time Ulugh Khan succeeded.\n\nArangal fell, was renamed Sultanpur, and the wealth and treasury were plundered and the captives were transferred from Warangal to the capital of Delhi Sultanate.\n\nThis was followed by the conquest and annexation of Mabar (Tamil Nadu coast). After this, Ulugh Khan raided Odisha and returned to Delhi with rich plunder.\n\nBy 1324, the borders of the Delhi sultanate had reached up to Madurai.\n\nIn 1328, the last Hindu principality of the area, Kampili (south Karnataka) was also annexed.\n\nThe excuse for attacking it was that a rebel cousin of Muhammad bin Tughlaq had been sheltered there.\n\nMeanwhile, Bengal had been virtually independent since the death of Balban of the Mamluk dynasty.\n\nIn 1324-1325 CE, after placing Delhi under the control of his son Ulugh Khan, Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq led his army to Lukhnauti (Bengal) and captured it after a series of battles.\n\nBut as he and his favorite son Mahmud Khan were returning from Lakhnauti to Delhi, eldest son Ulugh Khan schemed to kill him inside a wooden structure (kushk) built and designed to collapse, making it appear like an accident.\n\nThus, Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq died in 1325 CE and Mohammed bin Tughluq took over the throne forcefully.\n\nGhiyasuddin Tughlaq built the Tughlaqabad fort, making Tughlaqabad one of the 7 cities of Delhi.\n\nAmir Khusrau wrote Tughlaq Namah during this time and he was also a contemporary of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya.\n\nMohammed bin Tughlaq (1325-1351)\nCourtesy: maps of India\n\nMuhammad bin Tughluq attacked and pillaged Malwa, Gujarat, Mahratta, Tilang, Kampila, Dhur-samundar, Mabar, Lakhnauti, Chittagong, Sunarganw, and Tirhut.\n\nAlthough his far-flung campaigns were expensive, each raid and attack on non-Muslim kingdoms brought new looted wealth and ransom payments from captured people, the Delhi Sultanate briefly expanded to most of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nBut eventually, rebellions spread over the Indian subcontinent on a regular basis, making it impossible to maintain the expanding empire.\n\nHe transferred the capital from Delhi to Devagiri (Daulatabad) for better central control.\nHe forced royals, common people, and Sufis to move to Daulatabad, but many of them died in the rigorous journey (1500 Km).\nAfter 2 years, the Sultan abandoned Daulatabad and asked them to return to Delhi.\n\nInitially, he was tolerant towards all religions which is credited to him being the only sultan to receive literary, religious, and philosophical education.\n\nHe brought out many novel reforms even though they failed eventually:\n\nIn the 14th century, there was a global drop in the value of silver, which made minting coins difficult.\n\nIn China, Kublai Khan successfully implemented a paper-based token currency.\nThe Mongols of IIKhanate (Iran) also experimented with token currency.\n\nMuhammad bin Tughlaq introduced bronze and copper coins at par value of silver Tanka.\n\nHe exchanged silver coins for all copper coins but this move was not well received by the people of India.\nThe introduction of copper coins at par value of silver tanka led to forgery, hence the Sultan had to stop the circulation.\n\nTo overcome financial difficulties, he imposed heavy tax revenue in Doab, which led to a strong revolt from peasants (as at the same time a strong famine was also ravaging).\n\nLater, Sultan launched a scheme by which \u2018Takkavi loans\u2019 (Loans for cultivation) were given to farmers to buy seeds and to extend cultivation.\n\nHe established a separate department for agriculture \u201cdiwan-i-kohi\u201d.\n\nAlong with land taxes,\u00a0dhimmis\u00a0(non-Muslims) were required to pay crop taxes by giving up half or more of their harvested crop.\n\nThese sharply higher crop and land taxes led entire villages of Hindu farmers to quit farming and escape into jungles; they refused to grow anything or work at all.\n\nRevolts against Muhammad bin Tughlaq started in 1327 and continued throughout his reign and the sultanate shrunk after 1335:\n\nThe Madurai Sultanate revolted\n1336 Vijayanagar kingdom\nIn 1336 Kapaya Nayak of the\u00a0Musunuri Nayak\u00a0defeated the Tughlaq army and reconquered\u00a0Warangal\u00a0from the Delhi Sultanate.\n1342-Ilyas Khan, a rebel noble, captured Lakhnauti and Sonargaon.\n1347 Bahamani kingdom became independent in the Deccan.\nGovernors of Oudh, Multan, and Sind revolted against the authority of Muhammad bin Tughlaq.\n\nThe economic experiments of Muhammad bin Tughlaq resulted in a collapsed economy, and nearly a decade-long famine followed that killed numerous people in the countryside.\n\nIn 1327, he built the fourth city of Delhi, Jahanpanah, which was built enclosing the then inhabited area between Qila Rai Pithora and Siri.\n\nIbn Batuta, a traveler from Morocco visited India during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq. He acted as the chief Qazi of the sultanate for 6 years. He wrote the book \u201cRihla\u201d.\n\nIbn batuta came to India in 1334 and left extensive notes on the Tughlaq dynasty.\n\nMuhammad Bin Tughlaq died in 1351 on his way to\u00a0Thatta,\u00a0Sindh, while he was campaigning in\u00a0Sindh\u00a0against Taghi, a Turkic slave tribe.\n\nAlso read: India-Mongolia Relations\n\nFeroz Shah Tughlaq (1351-1388)\n\nHe was Muhammad bin Tughlaq\u2019s 45-year-old cousin/nephew who took over after the latter\u2019s death. He was of Turko-Indian origins as his mother was a Hindu princess.\n\nHe is termed as a mild and reluctant ruler, and was inept militarily as well, though he ruled for 37 years.\n\nFiroz Shah Tughlaq tried to regain the old kingdom boundary by waging a war with Bengal for 11 months in 1359. However, Bengal did not fall and remained outside of Delhi Sultanate.\n\nSimilarly, Malwa and Gujarat also broke away and declared independence.\n\nIn 1360, on his way back from the Bengal campaign, he raided Odisha.\n\nHe occupied the capital, massacred people, and desecrated the Jagannath Temple.\nThis weakened Odisha\u2019s ruling dynasty but later the Gajapati dynasty came to power in Odisha and extended its rule southwards till Karnataka which brought them into conflict with Vijaynagar.\n\nHe appointed Khan-i-Jahan Maqbal, a Telugu Brahmin convert as Wazir of his kingdom to help him in day-to-day administration.\n\nHe followed the advice of Ulemas (religious clerics) in administration.\nImposed Sharia rule strictly throughout the realm.\nJizya (Protection tax) was imposed on non-Muslims. Before this, Jizya whenever imposed by earlier sultans did not apply to Brahmins, but now they were brought under it.\nShias, Sufis, and Hindus were persecuted and treated as lesser citizens.\nHe stopped all harsh and barbaric tortures given as punishments previously.\nHe revived the iqta system and made it hereditary.\nHe imposed irrigation tax for the first time and developed irrigation networks, reservoirs, wells, and canals.\nHe encouraged horticulture as well.\n\nThere were royal factories or Kharkhanas where thousands of slaves were employed.\n\nHe had a large number of slaves kept in the Diwan-e-Bandagani.\nThere was a Diwan-i-Khairat to take care of the orphans and widows.\nHe developed free hospitals and marriage bureaus for poor Muslims.\nThe kotwals were ordered to make lists of unemployed people and provided dowries for the daughters of the poor.\n\nHe established a new town called Firozabad which was the 5th city of Delhi, which is now known as Firozshah Kotla. He repaired the Qutub Minar which was struck by lightning.\n\nHe brought two Ashokan pillars Topra (Ambala) and Meerut and erected them in Firuzabad.\nHe built many mosques, tombs, and gardens.\n\n(Cities of Delhi till now:\n\n1000 to 1060-Lal-Kot founded by Anang Pal II.\n1303-Siri was founded by Alaudin Khilji.\n1321-Tughlaqabad was founded by Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq.\n1327-Jahanpanah founded by Muhammad-bin Tughluq.\n1354- Firozabad was established)\n\nFiroz Shah did not make any attempts to expand the territory but rather lost many regions to independent kingdoms.\n\nHis eldest son, Fateh Khan, died in 1376. Firuz shah then abdicated in August 1387 and made his other son, Prince Muhammad, king. A slave rebellion forced him to confer the royal title to his grandson, Tughluq Khan.\n\nFiruz shah died in 1388 and was buried in Haus Khas. After his death struggle between nobles and the sultan broke and this further weakened the sultanate.\n\nTughluq Khan assumed power but died in the conflict. In 1389, Abu Bakr Shah assumed power, but he too died within a year. The civil war continued under Sultan Muhammad Shah, and by 1390, it had led to the seizure and execution of all Muslim nobility.\n\nThe sultanate started disintegrating with numerous rebellions and smaller Hindu and Muslim kingdoms asserting their independence.\n\nThe End of the Tughlaq dynasty\n\nThe number of claims on the throne created factions in the sultanate that fought with each other.\n\nBattles occurred every month, switching of sides by\u00a0amirs\u00a0became common, and the civil war between the two Sultan factions continued through 1398, till the invasion by Timur.\n\nIn 1398, the Turko-Mongol invader, Timur the lame (Tamerlane) invaded and defeated the armies of the Sultanate.\n\nTimur\u2019s invasion and destruction of Delhi, subsequent rebellion, and massacre of the citizens created chaos and the city did not recover from this loss for almost a century.\n\nTimur appointed\u00a0Khizr Khan, the future founder of the succeeding\u00a0Sayyid dynasty, as his viceroy at Delhi.\n\nInitially, Khizr Khan could only establish his control over Multan, Dipalpur, and parts of Sindh.\nSoon he started his campaign against the Tughlaq dynasty and entered Delhi victoriously in 1414.\n\nHence 1414 marked the end of the Tughlaq dynasty\u2019s rule in India.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Aibak expanded the Ghurid power in northern India by conquering and raiding several places in the Chahamana, Gahadavala, Chaulukya, Chandela, and other kingdoms.\n\nBy 1206-09, Aibak assumed the title of Sultan thus beginning the rule of the Slave dynasty and making Lahore his capital to secure the northwestern frontier of the kingdom.\n\nAfter being recognized as the ruler of India, Aibak focused on consolidating his rule in the territories already under his control, rather than conquering new territories.\n\nHe is also called \u201cLakh Baksh\u201d for his donation of 1 lakh copper coins or jitals as charity.\n\nHe patronized the great scholar Hasan Nizami.\n\nQutb-Uddin Aibak started the construction of the famous Qutub Minar in Delhi in honor of Sufi saint Qutub ud din Bakhtiyar Kaki.\n\nIt was finished by his son-in-law Iltutmish in 1220.\n\nHe also built the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque (meaning Triumph of Islam) in Delhi.\n\nThis mosque was constructed over the ruins of an ancient Jain and Hindu Temple complex.\n\nAibak also commissioned the construction of Adhai din ka Jhopra in Ajmer between 1192 and 1199.\n\nHe died in 1210 while playing chaughan or horse polo. The tomb of Qutubuddin Aibak is situated in Lahore.\n\nHe was succeeded by Aram Shah, but his relationship with Aibak is uncertain.\n\nSince Aibak died unexpectedly without naming a successor, the Turkic nobles (maliks and amirs) appointed Aram Shah as his successor to avoid instability in the kingdom.\n\nThere is no mention of Aram Shah before he is appointed Aibak\u2019s successor.\nIt was speculated that he was Aibak\u2019s son, but literary evidence only mentions Aibak having three daughters and no sons.\n\nHowever, the Turkish nobles in different parts of the Sultanate opposed his ascension, and Khalji nobles of Bengal rebelled against him. A group of nobles invited\u00a0Iltutmish\u00a0to occupy the throne.\n\nShamsuddin Itutmish (1211-1236)\n\nIltutmish, a former slave of Aibak and the governor of\u00a0Badaun, had a distinguished record of service and he was also the son-in-law of Qutbuddin Aibak.\n\nHe seized the throne by defeating Aibak\u2019s successor Aram Shah in 1211. This in a way checked the accession by hereditary rulers right at the beginning of the Slave Dynasty.\n\nItutmish is considered the true founder of the Slave dynasty as he subdued many Rajput kings and put down rebellions in Bengal, and Punjab and expanded the territory.\n\nHe belonged to the Ilbari tribe hence the dynasty is called the \u2018Ilbari dynasty\u2019.\n\nHe made Delhi his capital thus making him the first Muslim sovereign to rule from Delhi. He ruled with aid of Turkani Chihalgani/Chalisa, a council of 40 elite nobles.\n\nHe did not immediately claim a sovereign status and acknowledged the nominal authority of\u00a0Taj al-Din Yildiz, another former slave who had gained control of the Ghurid capital Ghazni.\n\nThe third battle of Tarain (1216):\n\nA Khwarazmian invasion made Yildiz move from Ghazni to India to demand control of the former Ghurid territories in India.\n\nIltutmish defeated and killed Yildiz at the third Battle of Tarain in 1216.\n\nItutmish also fought with\u00a0Nasir ad-Din Qabacha, another former Ghuird slave, for control of Lahore.\n\nIn 1221, the Khwarazmian ruler Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu moved to the Indus Valley region due to a Mongol invasion. But he returned in 1224 without entering Indian territories.\n\nIn the eastern territories, Aibak\u2019s former subordinates had carved out an independent kingdom headquartered at\u00a0Lakhnauti.\n\nIltutmish extracted tribute from the local ruler Ghiyasuddin Iwaj Shah in 1225 and annexed the region in 1227 after an unsuccessful rebellion by Ghiyasuddin.\n\nHe unsuccessfully attacked Mewar and Gujarat region and suffered huge losses.\n\nAdministration:\n\nIltutmish started the system of Iqtedari/Iqtedar which is the division of the empire into Iqtas, and these were assigned to the nobles as salary.\n\nHe separated the revenue, Law and order, and Army.\nIntroduced coinage in Arabic, Tanka (silver) & Jital (copper) with a standard weight of 175 grams.\n\nHis authority as a sultan was approved by the Abbasid Caliph.\n\nDuring Iltutmish\u2019s reign, the city of Delhi emerged as the center of Islamic power and culture in India. He patronized several scholars, including historian Minhaj-i-Siraj and the Sufi mystic Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki.\n\nIltutmish invested in numerous waterworks, mosques, and civil amenities in Delhi.\n\nHe completed the construction of the\u00a0Qutub Minar, which had been started by Qutb al-din Aibak.\nHe also commissioned the Hauz-i-Shamsi reservoir to the south of Qutub Minar and the madrasa (school) around it.\nHe built several\u00a0khanqah\u00a0(monasteries) and\u00a0dargahs\u00a0(graves) for Sufi saints.\nHe commenced the structure of Hamid ud-din\u2019s Khanaqa and built the Gandhak ki Baoli, a stepwell for the Sufi saint, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, who moved to Delhi during his reign.\nIn 1231, he built the\u00a0Sultan Ghari\u00a0funerary monument for his eldest son\u00a0Nasiruddin which was the first\u00a0Islamic\u00a0mausoleum\u00a0in Delhi.\n\nIltutmish died in 1236 due to illness and was buried in the Qutb complex in Mehrauli.\n\nHis death was followed by years of political instability in Delhi, with the sultanate seeing four rulers in a short period.\n\nRazia Sultana (1236-1240)\n\nSultan lltutmish\u2019s daughter Razia administered Delhi during 1231-1232 when he was busy with the Gwalior campaign. Iltutmish was impressed by her performance during this period, in controlling the court nobles.\n\nHence, Iltutmish is believed to have nominated daughter Raziya to the\n\nThrone by induced nobles and theologians (ulama)to assent to this nomination.\n\nThough Queens had ruled before, they usually ruled as regents while princes were minors, or captured power through court intrigues.\nTherefore, this nomination of his daughter to be his successor was a unique step by Iltutmish.\n\nIn 1236, Razia became the first female Muslim ruler of the Indian subcontinent and the only female Muslim ruler of Delhi.\n\nInitially, the Turkic nobles supported her because they expected her to be a puppet who they could control.\n\nBut after Iltutmish\u2019s death, his son (Razia\u2019s step-brother) Ruknuddin Firoz Shah ascended to the throne as his mother Shah Turkan held favors among some court nobles.\n\nShah Turkan planned to execute Razia.\nDuring a rebellion against Ruknuddin, Razia instigated the general public against Shah Turkan and ascended the throne after Ruknuddin was deposed in 1236.\n\nTo strengthen her position on the throne she had to fight off her step-brothers and powerful Turkic nobles.\n\nShe gave important positions to non-Turk nobles which marked the beginning of a power struggle between the monarch and Turkish nobles called the \u201cchahalgani\u201d.\nNizam-ul-Mulk Junaidi raised a rebellion of nobles to oppose her accession to the throne but was defeated by Raziya.\n\nRaziya then appointed an Abyssinian (Ethiopian) slave, Yakuth into important administrative positions. He was also her royal servant and military general.\n\nShe discarded female clothes, rode on elephants, and held court with her face unveiled.\n\nThe Turkish nobles accused her of violating female modesty and being too friendly to slave Yakuth Khan and rose in revolt.\n\nRaziya went to Lahore to down this revolt and on the way back, Yakuth was murdered.\n\nDuring this time, Altunia, Governor of Bhatinda, revolted against her and captured her as a prisoner. Razia agreed to marry him, in hopes of getting his support and crushing the Chahalgani revolt.\n\nIn 1240, Razia proceeded to Delhi with Altunia to regain her control but got defeated and murdered on orders of Chalisa/Chahalgani. They had now allied themselves with Muizuddin Bahram (Razia\u2019s half-brother) who ascended to the throne.\n\nThe grave of Razia is located at Mohalla Bulbuli Khana near Turkman Gate in Old Delhi. The 14th-century traveler Ibn Batuta mentions that Razia\u2019s tomb had become a pilgrimage center. Today, the site is largely neglected and the Archaeological Survey of India performs annual maintenance on it, but has been unable to beautify it further because it is surrounded by illegal construction.\n\nAfter Razia\u2019s death, the years between 1240 and 1266 saw rules of many weak rulers who were controlled by the chahalgani and killed if they tried to act on their own.\n\nMuizuddin Bahram Shah (1240-1242)\nAla-ud-din Masud (1242-1246)\nNasir-ud-din Mahmud (1246-1265) was very religious and a puppet of his Father-in-law and Wazir Balban.\n\nNasiruddin Mahmud strictly followed monogamy. He spent most of his time writing down verses of the Quran. He sold the handwritten copies and used the money for his expenses. Surprisingly enough, he had no servants to carry out his tasks.\n\nGhiyasuddin Balban (1266-1286)\n\nBalban belonged to the famous group of 40 Turkic slaves (chahalgani) of\u00a0Iltutmish and helped his son-in-law and youngest son of Iltutmish ascend the throne in 1246.\n\nBalban led many successful military campaigns, especially against the Mongol threat. The Mongols kept attacking the north-western frontiers continuously since 1241 and besieged Lahore and Multan.\n\nBalban was instrumental in checking the Mongol invasions through the frontiers of the Delhi Sultanate gradually receded from the river Jhelum to Beas.\u00a0 Balban recovered Multan but remained under heavy Mongol pressure.\n\nIn 1266, Nasiruddin Mahmud died and Balban ascended the throne himself.\n\nHe paid more attention to consolidation rather than expansion making the sultanate rule stronger from the inside.\nHe eliminated all Chahalgani and spared only the most loyal ones.\nHe separates the military department \u201cDiwan-i-Ariz\u201d to maintain law and order.\nHe was legendary for his sense of justice and to win the public\u2019s trust, he punished even the highest nobles if they transgressed his authority.\n\nAccording to Balban the Sultan was God\u2019s shadow on Earth and the recipient of divine grace.\n\nHe had to face many challenges like many bandits and robbers were active in the Ganga-Yamuna doab area, a few Rajput zamindars had set up forts in the area defying the government, and Mewatis raided Delhi frequently.\n\nBalban strongly dealt with the challenges and destroyed the Rajput strongholds and killed the Mewatis. He stationed Afghan soldiers in the doab area to safeguard the area.\n\nThe Mongol threat was dealt with both force and diplomacy thus being able to subdue the attacks though a large portion of Punjab was lost.\n\nHe maintained rigorous court discipline and started new customs to show that nobles were not equal, Sultan was above such as:\n\nSijada/ sajda \u2013 Prostration\nPaibos- kissing the sultan\u2019s feet to prove his supremacy over nobles\nHe introduced the Persian festival of Navroz.\n\nAmir Khusro was a contemporary of Balban.\n\nEnd of the Slave dynasty\n\nGhiyas ud din Balban ruled as the Sultan until he died in 1287. Balban\u2019s heir was his older son, Prince Muhammad Khan, but he perished in a battle against the Mongols in 1285. His other son, Bughra Khan, was reluctant to assume the throne and sought to remain the ruler of Bengal instead.\n\nBalban chose his grandson, Kaikhasrau, son of Prince Muhammad, as heir apparent. However, after his death, his nobles nominated Qaiqubad, another grandson of Balban as Sultan.\n\nQaiqubad was very weak and incompetent and eventually fell to stroke and had to pass the rule to his three years old sons, Shamsuddin Kayumars, who was eventually dethroned by his guardian, Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji in 1290, bringing an end to the Slave dynasty.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

King Jayachandra was defeated and killed in the battle.\n\nAfter successful campaigns, Muhammad rested the responsibility of consolidating the conquests in India on his Governor Qutubuddin Aibak.\n\nConquest of Bengal:\n\nMuhammad-bin-Baktiyar Khilji,\u00a0another general of Ghori, led a military expedition against Bihar and Bengal.\n\nIn between 1202 and1205 he attacked Odantapuri and plundered Buddhist Monastery, destroyed the university of Nalanda and Vikramasila, and defeated Lakshamansena of Bengal.\n\nHe wanted to expand eastwards and undertook an expedition into the Brahmaputra valley.\n\nThe Magh rulers of Kamrup (Assam) followed a scorched earth policy and allowed Khalji to enter without opposition.\nWhen the tired and hungry armies started retreating, the Assamese ambushed them from the forests and Bakhtiyar Khalji managed to escape with a few followers.\nBut he was later killed on his sick bed by one of his amirs.\nDeath of Muhammed Ghori\n\nThe Khokhar rebellion of Punjab: In 1206, Muhammad Ghori came for his last campaign into India, to put down the Khokhar rebellion.\n\nKhokhars were a warlike tribe in western Punjab and they cut off communications between Lahore and Ghazni.\n\nGhori\u2019s army carried out a large-scale massacre of Khokhars.\n\nOn his way back to Delhi, he was killed by an Arab Muslim fanatic of a rival sect who believed that Turks still stuck to their pagan practices from Central Asia and converted to Islam only for political or financial gains.\n\nThis ended the Ghurid dynasty in India, but Ghori\u2019s generals who started establishing independent dynasties in India were still left behind, and thus began the Delhi sultanate.\n\nLegacy of Muhammed Ghori\n\nGhori was the true founder of Muslim rule in India as he conquered a large portion of Hindu lands and also retained them. Qutub-ud-Din Aibak, his slave and viceroy, and his successors were successful in expanding Islam\u2019s dominance in India thus establishing a Muslim dynasty in Delhi.\n\nMuhammad Ghori came from humble beginnings than Mahmud Ghaznavi, but he was able to proclaim himself as ruler of Indian lands. He did not have offspring of his own, but he treated his Turkic slaves like his sons and proclaimed them his successors.\n\nHe remained loyal to his brother Ghiyasuddin and returned to Ghazni to put down the revolts in the western provinces, which were more strategically important for the Ghori Dynasty\u2019s survival.\n\nBut the Ghor Dynasty faded into obscurity after he was assassinated. However, his victory in India was not in vain, and it was further solidified under subsequent rulers.\n\nAfter his assassination, his Empire was divided among his slaves:\n\nQutb ud-Din Aibak\u00a0became ruler of\u00a0Delhi\u00a0in 1206, establishing the\u00a0Sultanate of Delhi, which marked the start of the\u00a0Mamluk dynasty\nNasir-ud-Din Qabacha\u00a0became ruler of\u00a0Multan\u00a0in 1210.\nTajuddin Yildoz\u00a0became ruler of\u00a0Ghazni.\nIkhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji became ruler in parts of\u00a0Bengal.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Both Prithviraj and his younger brother Hariraja were born in Gujarat, where their father Someshvara was brought up at the Chalukya court by his maternal relatives.\n\nPrithviraj\u2019s father, Someshvara was crowned the Chahamana king after the death of Prithviraja II. Someshvara died in 1177 CE when Prithviraj was about 11 years old.\n\nPrithiviraj who was a minor at that time ascended the throne with his mother as regent. During his early years, his mother managed the administration.\n\nHe took over the throne at the age of 16 and started his conquests also at that time. He quelled a rebellion by his cousins who came from the rival branch of the family.\n\nPrithviraj\u2019s first military victory was the suppression of a revolt led by his cousin Nagarjuna and the recapture of Gudapura.\nNagarjuna was Prithviraj\u2019s uncle Vigraharaja IV\u2019s son, and the Chahamana throne struggle sparked a feud between the two branches of the family.\n\nAt its height, Prithviraj Chauhan\u2019s empire stretched from the Himalayan foothills in the north to the foothills of Mount Abu in the south.\n\nThe empire stretched from the Betwa to the Sutlej rivers.\nHis empire included what is now Rajasthan, western Uttar Pradesh, northern Madhya Pradesh, and southern Punjab in modern times.\n\nPrithviraj had a dedicated ministry for scholars and poets, which was under the charge of Padmanabha. His court had several poets and scholars, including:\n\nJayanaka, a poet-historian who wrote\u00a0Prithviraja Vijaya\nVidyapati Gauda\nVagisvara Janardana\nVishvarupa, a poet\nPrithvibhata, a royal bard (identified as\u00a0Chand Bardai\u00a0by some scholars)\n\nHe fought a series of wars with his neighboring Rajput kingdoms.\n\nWar against Chandelas: Battle of Mahoba\n\nIn 1182-83, Prithviraj Chauhan invaded the Jejabhukti (Bundelkhand) which was ruled by Chandela king Paramardi. He took the capital of Mahoba, but it is debatable whether he just sacked the capital for a short while or captured it.\n\nWars with Gujarat:\n\nIn 1187 CE, Prithviraj attacked Gujarat which was ruled by Bhima II of the Chalukya/Solanki dynasty, who had already defeated Muhammad Ghori.\n\nSeveral small struggles ensued between them but eventually, Bhima II defeated Prithviraj which later led to a peace treaty between them.\n\nConflict with Gahadavala:\n\nThe Gahadavala kingdom was ruled by the powerful Jayachandra who had his capital at Kanauj.\n\nAccording to legend in Prithviraj Raso, Prithviraj eloped with Jayachandra\u2019s daughter Samyogita leading to rivalry between the two kings.\n\nThis rivalry later proved costly for Prithviraj Chauhan in his conquest against the Ghurids.\n\nWar with the Ghurids:\n\nThe predecessors of Prithviraj Chauhan had faced numerous attacks and raids from the Islamic dynasties. The northwestern areas of the Indian subcontinent were captured by the Islamic dynasties by the 12th century.\n\nThe Ghaznavids had taken over the areas around Multan during these times. but after the decline of Ghazni, these far-off lands were governed by independent governors.\n\nThe rise of Ghurids under Mohammed Ghori was quick as they ran over the lands west of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nGhori invaded Multan in 1175 CE while Prithviraj Chauhan was still a child. And in 1178 CE Ghori attacked Gujarat and might have passed by the boundaries of the Chahamana kingdom.\n\nAfter his defeat at the hands of Solankis of Gujarat, Ghori consolidated his army and marched back to India in 1191 CE. And during this time Prithviraj Chauhan was also expanding northwards after his peace treaty with the Solankis of Gujarat.\n\nTHE FIRST BATTLE OF TARAIN:\n\nDuring 1190-91 CE, Ghori invaded the Chahamana territory and captured Tabarhindah or Tabar-e-Hind (identified with Bathinda). He placed it under the charge of Zia-ud-din, the Qazi of Tulak. When Prithviraj learned about this, he marched towards Tabarhindah with his feudatories, including the Govindaraja of Delhi.\n\nThe two rulers met for the first battle of Tarain in 1191 CE and Ghori was eventually defeated by the confederacy of Prithviraj Chauhan after 12 months of the siege of Tabarhind.\n\nGhori escaped to Ghazni and regrouped a stronger army to attack India again.\n\nTHE SECOND BATTLE OF TARAIN:\n\nIt is mentioned that Prithviraj treated the first battle with ghori as a normal frontier fight, hence did not reinforce the western frontier against future attacks from ghurids.\n\nAnd as a result of his wars against neighboring Rajput kingdoms, he eventually lost allies as well. And his rivalry with the powerful king Jayachandra of Gahadavala was also a setback for his confederacy.\n\nGhori had gathered a well-equipped army and marched towards the Chahamana kingdom via Multan and Lahore, aided by Vijayaraja of Jammu.\n\nPrithviraj was defeated by Ghori in the second battle due to Ghori\u2019s elaborate and clever planning.\n\nThere are multiple disputed reports about Prithviraj Chauhan\u2019s fate after the defeat. It is said that Prithviraj was captured and taken to prisoner in Ghazni while some writings suggest that he was killed in battle. While some sources indicate that he ruled for a short while from Ajmer as a Ghurid vassal, but was later killed on conspiracy charges.\n\nBut it is clear that the Ghurids plundered and destroyed many temples in Ajmer but a Chauhan ruler continued there as a vassal of ghurids according to the coinage retrieved from the area.\n\nIt is also said that ghori placed Prithviraj\u2019s son Govindaraja on the throne of Ajmer after the death of Prithiviraj.\n\nThe fate of Prithviraj Chauhan has been written in different ways in different sources, hence is inconclusive.\n\nThe most accepted theory is that after Prithviraj\u2019s death, the Ghurids appointed his son Govindaraja on the throne of Ajmer as their vassal. In 1192 CE,\n\nPrithviraj\u2019s younger brother Hariraja dethroned Govindaraja and recaptured a part of his ancestral kingdom.\n\nGovindaraja moved to Ranastambhapura (modern\u00a0Ranthambore), where he established a\u00a0new Chahamana branch\u00a0of vassal rulers.\n\nHariraja was later defeated by the Ghurid general\u00a0Qutb al-Din Aibak.\n\nLegacy of Prithviraj Chauhan\n\nThere are seven inscriptions dated to Prithviraj\u2019s reign available and none of these were issued by the king himself :\n\nBarla or Badla inscription, 1177 CE\nPhalodi\u00a0inscription, 1179 CE, records the grants made by Prithviraj\u2019s vassal\u00a0Ranaka\u00a0Katiya.\nMadanpur inscriptions of 1182 CE:\nInscription 1: Mentions that Prithviraj invaded the territory of the Chandela ruler Paramardi\nInscription 2: Names Prithviraj\u2019s father, Someshvara, and grandfather, Arnoraja, and states that he plundered Jejakabhukti (the Chandela territory).\nUdaipur\u00a0Victoria Hall Museum inscription, 1187 CE.\nVisalpur\u00a0(Bisalpur near Tonk) inscription, 1187 CE.\n\nThe construction of the now-ruined\u00a0Qila Rai Pithora\u00a0fort in\u00a0Delhi\u00a0is attributed to Prithviraj.\n\nHe has been depicted as the last Hindu ruler of India before the rise of the Delhi Sultanate. His heroics have been etched in folklores and stories carried over the centuries.\n\nIn modern times also many films and television series have been inspired by the life of the great warrior king. Very recently, a movie on his life sparked controversies as well.\n\n-Article written by Swathi Satish"

Read here to know about the conquests that brought Muslim rule to India.\n\nDuring the early 7th Century, there were two major powers outside India and China:\n\nThe Sassanid Empire was a Zoroastrian nationalistic dynasty that ruled Persia (modern-day Iran).\nEastern Roman Empire/Byzantine Empire which was an orthodox Christian empire (The catholic Western Roman Empire had already fallen around 480 CE).\n\nBetween 602 and 628 CE, these empires were constantly waging war against each other, and the region around modern-day Iran, Jordan, and Syria was always war-torn.\n\nThese regions including the Arab peninsula occupied numerous polytheist tribes.\nThe Arab tribes were caravan traders who sold luxury goods to Constantinople and Persia. The caravan trade routes made Mecca and Medina rich cities.\n\nThe long war between these powers came to end with the Byzantines defeating the Persian Sassanid Empire.\n\nBut the dissolution of the Sassanid Empire and the eventual decline of Byzantines created a political and religious power vacuum in the Middle East region.\nThe long wars between Rome and Persia caused an economic decline in the region. The customers for Arab luxury products decreased in times of war.\nThere was no pilgrimage to the polytheist sites during the war which dried up the coffers of Mecca and Medina.\nSince the monotheist Romans had won, their monotheistic ideas and tales of Jesus and Moses were fast spreading in the Middle East.\n\nDuring this time, Muhammad (who later became Prophet Muhammad) was born to the powerful Quraysh tribe of Mecca. It is said that he had visions of god and angel Jibril which led him to preach a new religion following only one god, Allah.\n\nThe new religion, Islam, slowly brought all the different tribes of Arabia under one roof and united them.\n\nProphet Muhammad is believed to belong to the time period between 570 and 632 CE.

They believed in pagan gods.\n\nTheir mode of warfare was rapid raids and retreat which was possible because of their excellent quality of horses and habit of covering large distances on horseback.\nNumerous kingdoms rose and fell in rapid succession, as the invading Turks were quick to switch loyalties.\n\nBut over the years, in between enumerable wars, the Turks were slowly converted to Islam and a new class of soldiers was developed amongst them called the Ghazi, who was fierce soldiers and religious missionaries as well.\n\nThe Turko-Islam Ghaznavid Kingdom\n\nTurkish slave Alaptigin, a Samanid governor, established an independent kingdom at Ghazni, Afghanistan (962 CE).\n\nThe Samanid kingdom soon ended and the Ghaznavids took up the task of \u2018defense of Islam\u2019.\n\nHis son, Sabuktigin (977-998 CE) became completely independent in 988 CE. He was later known as Mahmud of Ghazni.

He initially attacked the Hindushahi rulers of Peshawar and Punjab and even the Muslim rulers of Multan (established by Muhamad bin Qasim).\n\nBattle of Waihind (1008-09): This was fought near Peshawar between Mahmud and Hindushahi ruler Anandapala who was in alliance with the ruler of Multan and the Khokars tribe of Punjab.\n\nThe battle was won by Mahmud as he captured both their territories.\n\nMahmud\u2019s most dreadful attacks on India were:\n\nRaid of Kanauj and Mathura in 1018 where after plundering them, he returned via Kalinjar, Bundelkhand, with huge riches.\nRaid of Somnath Temple in 1025.\n\nHowever, Mahmud did not annex these states but marched from Multan to Somnath, through Rajputana, without encountering any resistance.\n\nMahmud died in 1030 and was succeeded by his son Masud. But Masud could not maintain the kingdom and was defeated by the Seljuk Turks.\n\nGhaznavids lost most of their territories and ruled only in Punjab and Ghazni. But they continued their raids of India.\n\nA Persian scholar, Al-Biruni came to India with the Ghaznavids and wrote the book Kitab-ul-Hind or Tahqiq-i-hind, describing the society, culture, and kingdoms of medieval India.\n\nIn his account, he highlights choice parts of the Gita, the Upanishads, Patanjali, Puranas, the four Vedas, scientific texts (by Nagarjuna, Aryabhata), and stories from Indian mythology.\nHe also compared Indian thought to the Greek thought of Socrates, Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Galen, and others, and at times with Sufi teaching.\n\nThe Ghaznavid conquests opened the route for the spread of Islam in India as the north-western frontier was breached. The in-fighting between the Rajput Kingdoms gave the Ghaznavids a clear pathway to attack and raid western India numerous times. After the death of Ghazni, many more Islamic conquests comes India\u2019s way, eventually setting up sultanates here.\n\n\u2013Article written by Swathi Satish"

They had their capital at Anangpur.\n\nThey were later displaced by the Chahamanas of Shakambhari in the 12th century.\n\nIn 1152 CE, Anagpal Tomar II built a capital at Lal Kot, Delhi (the present-day area around the Qutub Minar complex).\n\nThe Rajput dynasties of Mewar\n\nThe Guhilas of Medapata (Mewar) ruled from 728 to 1303 CE. They were also Gurjara-Pratihara vassals. They assumed sovereignty after the decline of the Gurjara-Pratiharas in the 11th century.\n\nTheir capitals were at Nagahrada (Nagda) and Aghata (Ahar).\n\nGuhila literature Ekalinga Mahatmya (also called Ekalinga Purana) claims that the dynasty was founded by Guhadatta.\n\nThe famous Bappa Rawal was the 9th descendant who fought the battle of Rajasthan against the Arabs.\n\nHe reigned from 728 to 753 CE.\nBuilt/captured the fort at Chitrakut (Chittor) to fight the mlechchha Arabs.\n\nAfter about 500 years of rule, the Guhilas were divided into two branches-\n\nRawals ruled from Chitrakuta (Chittorgarh).\nRanas ruled from Sesoda and gave rise to the Sisodia Rajput dynasty.\n\nIn 1303, the last Rawal, Rata Singh was defeated and killed in battle by the Khilji dynasty ruling Delhi. After a few years, the Ranas re-established Mewar.\n\nThe Chahamans or Chauhans\n\nThe origin of Chauhans is attributed to the Chahamans of shakambari in around the 6th century. They were also the vassals of Pratiharas.\n\nWhen the Pratihara power declined after the Tripartite Struggle, the Chahamana ruler Simharaja assumed the title Maharajadhiraja according to the coinage found in the area.\n\nIn the 12th century, Ajayaraja II moved the kingdom\u2019s capital to Ajayameru (modern Ajmer). After this, the Chahamana rulers were also known as the Chauhans of Ajmer.\n\nChauhans captured Delhi (Dhillika) from the Tomars.

He annexed some of the Kalachuri territories, warded off Ghaznavid raids, and also fought the Palas of Bengal.\n\nIn 1194 CE, Govindachandra\u2019s grandson Jayachnadra was defeated by Ghurids.\n\nLater on, another branch of the family migrated to Rajasthan and established the dynasty of Kannujiya Rathores of Marwar (1126-1581 CE).\n\nThe first Rathore chieftain was Rao Siha, grandson of the last Gahadavala king Jayachandra.\nRao Jodha (ruled from 1438 to 1489) later shifted the capital to Jodhpur and built the famous Mehrangarh Fort.\nThe Solankis of Gujarat\n\nThey are also called the Chaulukyas of Gujarat. (They are not the same as the Chalukyas of Vengi, Kalyani, and Vatapi).\n\nThe Chaulukyas or the Solanki dynasty was founded by Mularaja by replacing the Chavda dynasty in 940 CE.\n\nThey ruled in the areas of Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Malwa between 940 and 1244. They had their capital at Anhilwada (modern-day Patan).\n\nThe Rani ki Vav of Patan was built by Chaulukya/Solanki Queen Udaymati in the 11th Century.\n\nIt was during the reign of Bhima I of the Chaulukyas/ Solankis, that Mahmud of Ghazni sacked the Somnath temple for the first time.\n\nIn the 11th century, Solanki king Karna defeated the Bhill chief of Ashaval and established Karnavati on the banks of River Sabarmati.\n\nKarnavati is the area of the modern-day\u2019s Ahmedabad region.\nThe Chandelas of Bundelkhand\n\nThey ruled the Bundelkhand or Jejakbhukti region between the 9th and 13th centuries.\n\nNannuka was the first Chandela ruler who established a small kingdom around Khajuraho. But they were still feudatories of the Pratiharas.\n\nIn the 10th century, the Chandela ruler Yashovarman became practically became independent but continued to acknowledge the Pratihara suzerainty.\n\nLater, under his successor Dhanga, the Chandelas became a sovereign power.\n\nThey fought battles with the neighboring dynasties, especially the Paramaras of Malwa and the Kalachuri of Tripuri.\n\nThe Chandelas built the famous Nagara-style temples of Khajuraho.\n\n11th century onwards, the Chandelas faced raids by the northern Muslim dynasties, including the Ghaznavids and the Ghurids.\n\nBy the beginning of the 13th century, the Chandela power effectively ended, following Chahamana and Ghurid invasions.\n\nThe Paramaras of Malwa\n\nThey ruled the Malwa (western Madhya Pradesh) region between the 9th and 14th centuries.

His reign saw the maximum extent of the Pala kingdom. The details of his rule are inscribed in the Munger copper Plate.\n\nHe extended control over Pragjyotishpur (Assam) and parts of Orissa.\nParts of modern-day Nepal also became his vassals.\nFor a while, his control also extended over Benaras.\nHe defeated Amoghavarsha of Rashtrakutas.\nMahendrapala (Devpala\u2019s son) (854 \u2013 860 CE)\nHe retained control over most of Bengal but lost some territories to the Pratiharas.\nHe was succeeded by his younger brother Shurapala I.\n\nThe Pala dynasty was fully replaced by the Sena dynasty in around the 12th century.\n\nFeatures of the Pala dynasty\n\nThe Pala period is known as the golden period of Bengali history.\n\nThe first Bengali literary work Charyapada is attributed to this period. It was written in an Abahatta language (the common ancestor of Bengali, Assamese, Odia, and Maithili).\nBuddhist poet Vajradatta who composed Lokesvarashataka was in Devapala\u2019s court.\nSanskrit scholars were also patronized by the Pala kings and Gaudapada composed Agama Shastra during this time.\nThe Pala art seen in Bengal and Bihar influenced the art of Nepal, Sri Lanka, Burma, and Java.\n\nMost of the accounts of the Pala dynasty are known from important foreign visitors\u2019 accounts at this time, and Arab merchant, Sulaiman.\n\nHe visited India around 850 CE, in the middle of the 9th Century.\nIn his writings, the Pala kingdom is called \u2018Ruhma\u2019 (Dharma-probably denoting Dharmapala).\nHe wrote that the Pala ruler had more troops than the Rashtrakutas and Pratiharas.\nHe mentioned that it was customary for the Pala king to be accompanied by a force of 50,000 elephants, which shows the grandeur of the Pala forces.\n\nOther foreign sources on the Palas are the Tibetan chronicles written by Taranath which were compiled much later in the 17th Century.\n\nPalas had maintained close cultural relations with Tibet and introduced a new form of Buddhism there. Hence, many Tibetan Buddhists came to Nalanda and Vikramsila for studies.\n\nThe Palas were great patrons of Buddhist learning and religion.\n\nNalanda University was revived by Dharmapala.\nTax collection from about 200 villages was allocated for its maintenance.\nDharmapala also founded the Vikramsila University in the modern-day Bhagalpur district of Bihar. It was second only to Nalanda in fame and education.\nPalas also built many viharas for monks and magnificent monasteries and temples: Somapura Mahavihara (in Bangladesh), and Odantapuri Monastery.\n\nPalas also had trade and cultural links with South East Asia.\n\nThe Sailendra dynasty (ruled the Srivijaya Empire of Sumatra and Medang Kingdom of Java) who followed Mahayana Buddhism, sent embassies to the Palas.\nThey got permission to build a monastery at Nalanda and Devapala endowed taxes from 5 villages for the upkeep of the monastery.\nThe Gurjara Pratihara dynasty\n\nThey were called the Gurjara-Pratiharas because they originated from the south-western region of Rajasthan, known as Gurjaratra or Gurjaradesa.\n\nThey started as local officials, who carved out a series of district towns in central and eastern Rajasthan.\n\nThe kingdom was founded by Nagabhatta I (730-760 CE)\n\nThe Pratiharas resisted a lot of Arab incursions from Sindh and defeated the Arabs in the battle of Rajasthan in 738 CE.\nMany times the Rashtrakuta rulers-Dhruva and Gopala III defeated the Pratihara quests to gain the upper Gangetic valley and Malwa.\n\nMihir Bhoja (836-885 CE) is considered as the greatest ruler of the Pratihara empire as he rebuilt the empire.\n\nBhoja recovered Kanauj in 836 and it remained their capital for almost a century after that.\nBhoja tried to expand eastwards but was defeated by Devapala.\nAfter the battle with the Rashtrakutas on the bank of the Narmada, Bhoja retained control over parts of Malwa and Gujarat but he was unable to proceed farther south.\nAn inscription says that his territories extended to the east of the Sutlej River.\n\nAfter Devapala\u2019s death and the subsequent weakening of the Pala kingdom, Bhoja extended his empire in the east.\n\nBhoja was a devotee of Vishnu hence he adopted the title of \u2018Adivaraha\u2019 which is inscribed on some of his coins.\n\nThe Pratiharas had good sturdy cavalry as they imported horses from Arabia and Central Asia.\n\nSome Arab merchant-traveler accounts say Pratiharas had the largest cavalry in India.\n\nMihir Bhoja died in 885 CE and was succeeded by his son Mahendrapala I.\n\n(**There was a Mahendrapala in Pala dynasty also who was Devpala\u2019s son).\n\nMahendrapala ruled till 908-09 and maintained the empire of Bhoja, which extended over northern Bengal.\nHe lost Punjab after losing to the king of Kashmir.\nHis inscriptions are found in Kathiawar, east Punjab, and Awadh.\n\nMany foreign accounts have been found describing the Pratihara kingdom.\n\nAl-Masudi of Baghdad visited Gujarat from 915 to 916.\n\nHe calls the Gurjara Pratihara kingdom, Al-Juzr.\nHe wrote that the kingdom has 18,00,000 villages and cities and that the king\u2019s army had 4 divisions.\nHe mentioned the wars fought by the Pratiharas, like with the ruler of Multan in the north, Rahstrakutas in the south, and Palas in the east.\n\nThe Pratiharas encouraged art and culture:\n\nSanskrit poet and dramatist Rajashekhar lived at the court of Mahipala who was the grandson of Bhoja.\nPratiharas built many fine temples in Kanauj.\nThey sent Indian scholars and embassies to the Caliph of Baghdad where they introduced Indian mathematics and sciences to the Arabs which later spread to Europe through the Moors.\nAdministration of Gurjara Pratiharas\nSome areas of the empires were administered directly while other areas were ruled by vassal chiefs.\nVassal chiefs were autonomous in internal affairs, however, they had to pay fixed tribute and supply troops to the Pratihara King.\nThe vassal\u2019s chiefs like Paramaras of Malwa and Chandellas of Bundelkhand rebelled whenever the Pratiharas had a weak ruler.\n\nPalas and Gurjara Pratiharas had similar administrative division:\n\nBhukti (provinces)\nMandalas or Visayas(districts)\nPattala was the unit below the Visaya in the Pala kingdom\n\nThe Governor of Bhukti was called \u2018Uparika\u2019 and he collected land revenue and maintained law and order with the help of the army.\n\nThe head of mandala or visaya was \u2018Visayapati\u2019 who had the same duties as uparika but on a larger area.\n\nThe village administration was carried out by the village headman and the village accountant and these posts were hereditary.\n\nThey were paid by grants of rent-free lands.\nThe headman was often helped in his duties by the village elder who was called the grama-mahajana or grama-mahattara.\n\nThe Pratiharas kingdom saw growth of small chieftains called samantas or bhogapatis who dominated over several villages.\n\nVisayapatis and smaller chiefs merged later and the term Samanta is later used for both.\nThe weakening of Gurjara Pratiharas\nDuring 915 \u2013 918 CE, the Rashtrakuta king Indra III attacked Kanauj and devastated the city during the reign of Mahipala I.\nPratiharas also lost Gujarat to the Rashtrakutas which cut off their access to the sea trade hence leading to an economic slowdown.\nThen around 963CE, Rashtrakuta ruler Krishna III invaded northern parts and defeated the Pratiharas which led to their rapid dissolution.\n\nThe later rulers could\u00a0not revive the dynasty and gradually their feudatories declared independence and the empire was reduced to the area around Kannauj.\n\nIn the the11th century CE, the Ghaznavids completely wiped off the Pratiharas from the political map.\n\nThe Pratiharas were succeeded by smaller Rajput clans of Chauhans/Chahamanas (Rajputana), the Paramaras/Pawars (Malwa), and the Solankis/Chalukyas (Gujarat)\n\nThe three kingdoms \u2013 Palas, Pratiharas, and Rashtrakutas maintained a large and well-organized army consisting of infantry, cavalry, and war elephants.\n\nThe Palas had the largest number of elephants.\nPratiharas and Rashtrakutas had good cavalry of imported horses from Arabia and West Asia.\nThere is no reference to war chariots during this period which shows that chariots were out of use by now.\nRashtrakutas had a large number of forts that were garrisoned by special troops, with their independent commanders.\nThe Palas and Rahstrakutas maintained navies too.\n\nOut of all three kingdoms the Gurjara \u00a0Pratiharas held the largest of the areas, defeating the Palas and Rashtrakutas, hence they are considered the winner of the tripartite struggle.\n\nTrade and Commerce\n\nThe 7th to 10th centuries saw a period of stagnation/decline of trade in northern India due to:\n\nDecline in long-distance trade within the country because of internal conflicts and a policy of localism.\nAbsence of gold and silver coins because of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire (476-554 CE), with whom India had profitable trade.\n\nIndian merchants organized themselves into guilds.\n\nManigraman and Nanadesi were the most famous guilds in South India.\n\nTamralipti (Tamluk, East Midnapore, West Bengal) was the chief port for sailing to Java, Sumatra, and other southeast kingdoms."

He was named the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 son of Justice Ranade.\n\nGokhale apart from learning English studied Western political thought and he became a great admirer of theorists such as John Stuart Mill and Edmund Burke.\n\nThe political journey of Gopal Krishna Gokhale\n\n1889: Gokhale became a member of the Congress and fought for greater political power in the administration along with Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Dadabhai Naoroji, Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Annie Besant.\n\nHe was moderate in his views and sought to petition the British authorities by curating a process of dialogue and discussion that would yield greater British respect for Indian rights.\n\n1894: After visiting Ireland, he arranged for Alfred Webb, an Irish nationalist to serve as President of Congress.\n\n1895: Gokhale became the Congress\u2019 joint secretary along with Tilak.\n\n1899: He was elected to the Bombay Legislative Council, and was elected to the Imperial Council of the Governor-General of India in 1901 and again in 1903 as a non-officiating member representing Bombay Province.\n\nInterestingly, Tilak and Gokhale\u2019s early careers were somewhat similar. Both went to Elphinstone College, became mathematics professors, and were important members of the Deccan Education Society.\n\nHowever, their views regarding how to improve the standard of living of Indians were different, and it became increasingly apparent in later years.\n\nGokhale and Tilak\n\nGokhale and Tilak, both important political leaders in early 20th century India, differed a lot in their ideologies.\n\nGokhale was a man of moderate temperament, while Tilak was a radical who would advocate using force to attain freedom.\n\nWhile Gokhale believed that for India to get self-government, it should adopt constitutional means and cooperate with the British government, Tilak believed in protest, boycott, and agitation.\n\n1907: The ideological differences between moderates and extremists came out openly at the Surat session in 1907.\n\nThe camp of Tilak wanted to make Lala Lajpat Rai the president of Congress, while followers of Gokhale, endorsed Rash Behari Ghosh for the Congress presidency.\n\nThe two parties were engaged in a physical scuffle, and when people tried to attack Tilak on the dais, Gokhale went and stood next to Tilak to protect him.\n\n1908: Tilak was arrested on a sedition charge and was sentenced to six years imprisonment and dispatched to Mandalay. This opened the political scene for moderates to take control. At that time, Gokhale was in England.\n\nGokhale\u2019s one major difference with Tilak was based on the Age of Consent Bill introduced by the British government in 1891-92. Gokhale was liberal and wanted to purge the ill practices in Hinduism including child marriages.\n\nThe two leaders also competed with each other for the control of the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha.\n\nBut despite their differences, Gokhale and Tilak respected each other deeply.\n\nGokhale and Gandhi\n\nGopal Krishna Gokhale mentored Mahatma Gandhi when the latter was trying to build his political career in India.\n\n1912: He visited South Africa at Gandhi\u2019s invitation. When Gandhi returned to India from South Africa, he was personally guided by Gokhale, who also gave him knowledge of the Indian society and helped him to understand the issues troubling the common people of our country.\n\nGandhi called Gokhale his mentor and guide and also recognized him as an admirable leader and master politician. He also wrote a book in Gujarati dedicated to the Gokhale titled\u00a0\u2018Dharmatma Gokhale\u2019.\n\nDespite his deep respect for Gokhale, Gandhi rejected Gokhale\u2019s faith in western institutions as a means of achieving political reform and chose not to become a member of Gokhale\u2019s\u00a0Servants of India Society.\n\nGopal Krishna Gokhale: The Educationist and social reformer\n\n1905: Gokhale was elected the President of the Indian national congress.\n\nDuring this time he founded the Servants of India Society to work for the expansion of Indian education.\n\nGokhale believed that the true political change in India would be possible only when a new generation of Indians became educated about their civil and patriotic duty to their country and each other.\n\nHe thought that the prevalent educational institutions and the Indian Civil Service were inadequate to provide Indians with opportunities to gain political education, and hoped that the Servants of India Society would fill that need.\n\nThe Society promoted Indian education in earnest, and its works included organizing mobile libraries, founding schools, and organizing night classes for factory workers.\n\nGopal Krishna Gokhale believed that social reforms would be best achieved by working within existing British government institutions, and it earned him the opposition of more aggressive nationalists such as Tilak.\n\nLiberal Economist\n\n1895: Gopal Krishna Gokhale was applauded for his deposition before the Welby Commission on the financial condition of India and he delivered unique speeches on the budget in the Central Legislative Council, with thorough statistical analysis.\n\n1909: He played a key role in bringing about the Morley-Minto Reforms, the beginning of constitutional reforms in India.\n\nGopal Krishna Gokhale brushed aside the opposition and would work directly with the British throughout his political career to further his reform goals.\n\nHe established the Ranade Institute of economics in 1908 and started an English weekly newspaper- The Hitavada.\n\nDeath:\n\nGopal Krishna Gokhale died on February 19, 1915. After his death, Tilak wrote an editorial in Kesari paying tributes to Gokhale.\n\nLegacy of Gokhale\n\nGopal Krishna Gokhale\u2019s contribution helped to shape the Indian freedom struggle into a quest for building an open society and egalitarian nation.

He began with public movements and marches to open up public drinking water resources.\n\nHe also began a struggle for the right to enter Hindu temples.\n\nIn a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly condemned the classic Hindu text, the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying caste discrimination and \u201cuntouchability\u201d, and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient text.\n\nPoona Pact, 1932:\n\nIn 1932, the British colonial government announced the formation of a separate electorate for \u201cDepressed Classes\u201d in the\u00a0Communal Award.\u00a0Mahatma Gandhi\u00a0fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community.\n\nGandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the Yerwada Central Jail of Poona. Following the fast, congressional politicians organized joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada.\n\nOn 25 September 1932, the agreement, known as the\u00a0Poona Pact\u00a0was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and\u00a0Madan Mohan Malaviya\u00a0(on behalf of the other Hindus).\n\nThe agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures within the general electorate.\n\nThe text used the term \u201cDepressed Classes\u201d to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the India Act 1935 and the later Indian Constitution of 1950.\n\nAmbedkar\u2019s political journey\n\nIn 1936, Ambedkar founded the\u00a0Independent Labour Party, which contested the 1937 Bombay election to the\u00a0Central Legislative Assembly\u00a0for the 13 reserved and 4 general seats, and secured 11 and 3 seats respectively.\n\nAmbedkar published his book\u00a0Annihilation of Caste on 15 May 1936. It strongly criticized Hindu orthodox religious leaders and the caste system in general and included \u201ca rebuke of Gandhi\u201d on the subject.\n\nIn 1937, Ambedkar tabled a bill in the Bombay Legislative Assembly aimed at abolishing the\u00a0khoti\u00a0system by creating a direct relationship between government and farmers.\n\nAmbedkar served on the Defence Advisory Committee and the Viceroy\u2019s Executive Council as minister for labour.\n\nAfter the\u00a0Lahore resolution\u00a0(1940) of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled\u00a0Thoughts on Pakistan, which analyzed the concept of \u201cPakistan\u201d in all its aspects.\n\nAmbedkar argued that the Hindus should concede Pakistan to the Muslims. Ambedkar also criticized Islamic practice in South Asia. While justifying the Partition of India, he condemned child marriage and the mistreatment of women in Muslim society.\nMaker and conscience-keeper of modern India\n\nBabasaheb, as he was fondly called by friends, admirers, and followers, braved the walls of prejudice and caste discrimination in early 20th century India to emerge as an exemplar and an unflinching crusader against the inequities of the caste system and socio-economic deprivation that afflicted millions of Indians.\n\nHis life is an inspirational story of achievements despite trying circumstances and the indomitable will to move beyond individual strife for the larger cause of social justice and national renaissance.\n\nThe drafting of India\u2019s constitution:\n\nIndia\u2019s tryst with destiny, as India\u2019s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru spoke eloquently about at the fateful hour of India\u2019s independence, saw Dr. Ambedkar being entrusted with a monumental responsibility: he was appointed Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee on August 29, 1947.\n\nHe fashioned a pluralistic and inclusive Constitution that guides and animates India to this day, guaranteeing equal opportunity and freedom of expression and faith for all citizens in a secular democracy.\n\nFamous scholar Granville Austin has evoked the revolutionary spirit of Dr. Ambdekar that is reflected in the Indian Constitution. \u201cThe majority of India\u2019s constitutional provisions are either directly arrived at furthering the aim of social revolution or attempt to foster this revolution by establishing conditions necessary for its achievement,\u201d wrote Austin.\n\nThe Constitution, drafted under Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s leadership, abolished untouchability and outlawed all forms of discrimination.\n\nAn ardent proponent of the rights of women, minorities, and the socially underprivileged, he argued eloquently and won the Constituent Assembly\u2019s support for introducing a system of reservations of jobs in the civil services, schools, and colleges for members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Class.\n\nThis was later reflected in the policies of affirmative action adopted by the Indian government.\n\nAn erudite economist and institution-builder, Dr. Ambedkar authored many scholarly treatises on economics and was the driving force behind the establishment of the Finance Commission of India. His ideas also laid the foundation for the setting up of India\u2019s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nWhile Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s achievements were manifold and straddled a wide spectrum, his inner life was richer and marked by spiritual vitality. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism.\n\nDeath:\n\nHe died in 1956 in New Delhi while working on \u201cThe Buddha and his Dhamma\u201d, which was published posthumously.\n\nThe popularity and esteem he enjoyed among all lovers of social justice were seen at his funeral at Dadar Chowpatty beach on December 7, 1956, which was thronged by at least half a million mourners.\n\nLegacy of Babasaheb Ambedkar\n\nBabasaheb\u2019s myriad contributions to the forging of a modern inclusive India were recognized posthumously through the Bharat Ratna in 1990.\n\nDr. Ambedkar\u2019s ideals of social inequality redesigned the contours of Indian politics. His surging popularity was reflected in scholarly biographies, numerous statues, and memorials across the country.\n\nToday, Ambedkar is revered nationally, and figures in the national pantheon as one of the makers of modern India, along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Tagore.\n\nHis birthday, April 14, has been christened \u2018Ambedkar Jayanti\u2019 or \u2018Bhim Jayanti\u2019 and is celebrated as a public holiday.\n\nAs India celebrates the birth anniversary of this national icon, Babasaheb remains an inspiration for millions of Indians and proponents of equality and social justice across the globe.\n\nFittingly, although it\u2019s a matter of coincidence, one can see the trace of Babasaheb\u2019s radiant vision in the \u201cSustainable Development Goals\u201d that are set to be formally adopted by the UN General Assembly to eliminate poverty, hunger, and socio-economic inequality by 2030.\n\nBooks by Ambedkar\nThe Problem of the Rupee \u2013 Its origin and its solution\nThe Untouchables, Who are they?\nWho were the Shudra?\nStates and Minorities\nEmancipation of the Untouchables"

Initially, he supported Mahatma Gandhi and the Non-Cooperation Movement. However, when Gandhi withdrew the movement in the wake of the Chauri Chaura incident, Bhagat Singh turned to revolutionary nationalism.\n\nBhagat singh was deeply affected by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (1919) and the violence against unarmed Akali protestors at Nankana Sahib (1921).\n\nIn 1924 in Kanpur, he\u00a0became a member of the Hindustan Republican Association,\u00a0started by\u00a0Sachindranath Sanyal a year earlier. The main organizer of the Association was Chandra Shekhar Azad and Bhagat Singh became very close to him.\n\nIn 1926, he founded the\u00a0Naujawan Bharat Sabha, an organization that aimed to encourage revolution against British rule by rallying the peasants and workers.\n\nHe made contact with the \u2018Workers and Peasants Party\u2019 which brought out the monthly magazine Kirti in Punjabi. For the next year, Bhagat Singh worked on the editorial board of Kirti.\n\nIn 1928, he established the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) along with Sukhdev, Chandrashekhar Azad, and others.\n\nHSRA collapsed after Chandrashekar Azad was shot dead in 1930.\n\nBhagat Singh\u2019s Revolutionary activities\n\nHis association with revolutionaries began with HSRA. He was introduced to the philosophy of bombs and the importance of the armed revolution.\n\nIn 1927, he was first\u00a0arrested on charges of association with the Kakori Case\u00a0accused of an article written under the pseudonym Vidrohi (Rebel).\n\nHe was also accused of being responsible for a bomb explosion at Lahore during the Dussehra fair.\n\nThe Saunders Case/ Lahore Conspiracy case:\n\nIn 1928, Lala Lajpat rai died due to injuries sustained during a protest against the Simon Commission in Lahore. The lathi-charge was ordered by the superintendent of police James Scott.\n\nBhagat Singh and his revolutionary friends decided to avenge the death of the dear leader. However, in a case of mistaken identity, they assassinated another police official J P Saunders. This was known as the\u00a0Lahore Conspiracy Case.\n\nAfter this incident, Bhagat Singh fled from Lahore and made changed his appearance to avoid arrest.\n\nThe murder was condemned as a retrograde action by Mahatma Gandhi, but Jawaharlal Nehru later wrote:\n\n\u201cBhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honor of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol, the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name. Innumerable songs grew about him and the popularity that the man achieved was something amazing.\u201d\n\nCentral assembly bombing case:\n\nOn 8th April 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw a bomb in the Central Assembly at Delhi, from the Visitors\u2019 Gallery. They also threw pamphlets and raised pro-revolutionary slogans.\n\nBoth the revolutionaries did not resist arrest since they wanted to spread their message of revolution and anti-imperialism and wanted to use the trial as a platform for it.\n\nThey shouted slogans of \u201cInquilab Zindabad\u201d during the whole arrest. The slogan became quite popular among the youth and many freedom fighters.\n\nThere were no causalities in the incident as it was never their intention to cause physical harm to anyone. Their aim was \u2018to make the deaf hear\u2019.\n\nBhagat Singh was the mastermind behind the incident and was inspired by Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist, who was executed by France for a similar incident in Paris.\n\nIn the trial for the incident, both Singh and Dutt were sentenced to imprisonment for life.\n\nBy this time Bhagat Singh was also linked to the JP Saunder\u2019s murder incident. He, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev was charged with the murder of Saunders.\n\nThe trial and death of Bhagat Singh\n\nThe trial started in July 1929 and was published in daily newspapers.\n\nThe young revolutionaries started a hunger strike in Lahore prison demanding better conditions for political prisoners who were also treated as criminals.\n\nThey were met by many leaders including Jawaharlal Nehru while they fasted for 116 days which only ended after repeated requests from family and congress leaders.\n\nBut the trial was a one-sided affair and Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were sentenced to death. The verdict was met with large criticism and many national leaders requested to reduce the sentence but in vain.\n\nThe three were ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931 but the sentence was carried out a day earlier at the Lahore Jail. After the hanging, their mortal remains were cremated in secret.\n\nThe executions were reported widely by the press, especially as they took place on the eve of the annual convention of the Congress party in Karachi. Gandhi faced black flag demonstrations by angry youths who shouted: \u201cDown with Gandhi\u201d.\n\nIndividual Heroism vs Mass Movement\n\nBhagat Singh initially believed in individual heroism to achieve the goal.\n\nHowever, he later realised that individual heroism stood no chance against the brute force of the British empire and the\u00a0only way to a successful revolution was to unleash a popular broad-based movement.\n\nLegacy of Bhagat Singh\n\nEvery year,\u00a0March 23\u00a0is observed as\u00a0Martyrs\u2019 Day\u00a0as a\u00a0tribute to freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar, and Shivaram Rajguru. The day is also known as\u00a0Shaheed Diwas or Sarvodaya Day.\n\nDuring the centenary of his birth, a group of intellectuals sets up an institution named Bhagat Singh Sansthan to commemorate him and his ideals.\n\nHe was an atheist and ardent reader- his book \u201cWhy I am an Athiest\u201d is quite popular.\n\nFew of his famous quotes were-\n\nThey may kill me but they cannot kill my ideas. They can crush my body, but they will not be able to crush my spirit.\nBombs and pistols do not make a revolution. The sword of revolution is sharpened on the whetting stone of ideas.\nMay the sun in his course visit no land freer, happier, more lovely, than this our own country.\nBut mere faith and blind faith is dangerous: it dulls the brain and makes a man reactionary.\nRevolution is an inalienable right of mankind. Freedom is an imperishable birthright of all. Labour is the real sustainer of society.\n\nThe youth of India still gain inspiration in his life- a young revolutionary with fire in his blood and calm in his heart."

Kanhoji Jedhe and Baji Pasalkar were appointed to train Shivaji in the military and martial arts.\n\nShivaji was married to Saibai Nimbalkar in 1640.\n\nShivaji\u2019s conflicts with Bijapur\n\nIn 1645 he successfully got control of several strategic forts under the Bijapur Sultanate around Pune \u2013 Torna from Inayat Khan, Chakan from Firangoji Narsala, Kondana from Adil Shahi Governor, along with Singhagarh and Purandar.\n\nShivaji had emerged as a threat for Mohammed Adil Shah who gave the order to imprison Shahaji in 1648. Shahaji was released on the condition that Shivaji kept a low profile and kept from further conquests.\n\nBut Shivaji resumed his conquests after Shahaji\u2019s death in 1665 by acquiring the valley of Javali from Chandra Rao More, a Bijapur jagirdaar.\n\nAlso read: Important Terms from Medieval Indian History\n\nBattles fought by Shivaji:\n\nBattle of Pratapgad, 1659 was fought at the fort of Pratapgad near the town of Satara, Maharashtra, between the forces of Shivaji Maharaj and the Adilshahi general Afzal Khan.\n\nThe battle of Pavan was fought at a mountain pass in the vicinity of the fort.\n\nThe sacking of Surat, 1664 occurred near the city of Surat, Gujarat, between Shivaji Maharaj and Inayat Khan, a Mughal captain.\n\nBattle of Purandar, 1665 was a major battle fought between the Mughal Empire and Maratha Empire.\n\nBattle of Sinhagad, 1670 occurred on the fort of Sinhagad near the city of Pune, Maharashtra between Tanaji Malusare, a commander of Maratha ruler Shivaji Maharaj and Udaybhan Rathod, fort keeper under Jai Singh I who was a Mughal Army Chief.\n\nBattle of Kalyan, 1682-83 was significant as Bahadur Khan of the Mughal Empire defeated the Maratha army and took over Kalyan.\n\nBattle of Sangamner, 1679 was again fought between the Mughal Empire and Maratha Empire. This was the last battle fought by Shivaji.\n\nMarathas in conflict with Mughals\n\n1657: Shivaji raided Mughal territory near Ahmednagar and in Junnar to which Aurangzeb responded to the raids by sending Nasiri Khan, who defeated the forces of Shivaji at Ahmednagar.\n\n1659: Shivaji defeated a large force of Shaista Khan (Aurangzeb\u2019s maternal uncle) and the Bijapur army in Pune.\n\n1664: Shivaji took over the wealthy Mughal trading port of Surat.\n\n1665: The\u00a0Treaty of Purandar was signed between Shivaji and Raja Jai Singh I who was representing Aurangzeb after Marathas were defeated in the Battle of Purandar.\n\nMarathas had to relinquish many forts to the Mughals and Shivaji and Sambhaji agreed to meet Aurangzeb at Agra.\n\n1666: When Shivaji went to meet the Mughal emperor at Agra, he was arrested and kept prisoner. He and his son escaped in disguise from there.\n\nAfter that, there was peace between the Marathas and the Mughals until 1670.\n\nAfter 1670 Shivaji launched an all-out offensive against the Mughals. He recovered most of his territories sieged by the Mughals within four months. Through his military tactics, Shivaji acquired a large part of the land in the Deccan and western India.\n\nShivaji\u2019s relations with the British\n\n1660: Initially he was on cordial terms with the British, but when the British supported the Bijapur sultanate against him, things became different.\n\n1670: Shivaji acted against the English in Bombay by them not selling them war material. This conflict continued and numerous negotiations between the two parties to come to terms failed.\n\nCoronation and establishing Maratha power:\n\nHe was crowned the King of Marathas on June 6, 1674, at Raigadh in an elaborate coronation ceremony, establishing the Hindu kingdom among the Muslim-dominated south.\n\nHe took upon several titles like Chhatrapati (paramount sovereign), Shakakarta (founder of an era), Kshatriya Kulavantas (head of Kshatriyas), and Haindava Dharmodhhaarak (one who uplifts the sanctity of Hinduism).\n\nPost-coronation, the Marathas launched aggressive conquest efforts to consolidate most of the Deccan states under their sovereignty.\n\nThey conquered Khandesh, Bijapur, Karwar, Kolhapur, Janjira, Ramnagar, and Belgaum and captured forts at Vellore and Gingee, controlled by the Adil Shahi rulers.\n\nShivaji also came to an understanding with his step-brother Venkoji over his holdings over Tanjavur and Mysore.\n\nHe aimed at was to unify the Deccan states under the rule of a native Hindu ruler and protect it from outsiders like the Muslims and Mughals.\n\nAdministration under Shivaji\nCentral Administration:\n\nThe Maratha administration had Chhatrapati as the supreme sovereign and a team of eight ministers (Ashtapradhan) was appointed to oversee the enforcement of various policies. These eight ministers reported directly to Shivaji and were given a lot of power in terms of the execution of policies formulated by the King. These eight ministers were:\n\nThe Peshwa or Prime Minister, who was head of general administration and represented the king in his absence.\nThe Majumder or the Auditor was responsible for maintaining the financial health of the kingdom\nThe Pandit Rao or Chief Spiritual Head was responsible for overseeing the spiritual well-being of the kingdom, fixing dates for religious ceremonies, and overseeing charitable programs undertaken by the king.\nThe Dabir or Foreign Secretary was entrusted with the responsibility of advising the king on matters of foreign policies.\nThe Senapati or Military General was in charge of overseeing every aspect of the military including organization, recruitment, and training of soldiers. He also was the strategic advisor of the king in the time of war.\nThe Nyayadhish or Chief Justice saw formulations of law and their subsequent enforcement, civil, judicial as well as military.\nThe Mantri or Chronicler was responsible for keeping elaborate records of everything the king did in his daily life.\nThe Sachiv or Superintendant was in charge of royal correspondence.\n\nHe divided his kingdom into four provinces, each headed by a Mamlatdar. The village was the smallest unit of administration and the head was titled Deshpande, who headed the Village Panchayat.\n\nShivaji also promoted the use of Marathi and Sanskrit in his court instead of Persian.\n\nHe was tolerant of all religions and was strictly against caste discrimination.\n\nRevenue Administration:\n\nShivaji\u00a0eliminated the Jagirdari System and replaced it with Ryotwari System, removing the need for middlemen between farmers and the state.\n\nShivaji strictly supervised the Mirasdars who had hereditary rights inland.\n\nThe revenue system was\u00a0based on the Kathi system of Malik Amber\u00a0in which every piece of land was measured by Rod or Kathi.\n\nShivaji introduced Chauth and Sardeshmukhi\u00a0taxes.\n\nChauth amounted to 1/4thof the standard which was paid to Marathas as a safeguard against Shivaji\u2019s forces raiding Non-Maratha territories.\nSardeshmukhi was an additional levy of 10% demanded from areas outside of the kingdom.\nMilitary Administration:\n\nShivaji maintained a strong military force, built several strategic forts to secure his borders, and developed a strong naval presence along the Konkan and Goan coasts.\n\nThe ordinary soldiers were paid in cash, but the chief and military commander were paid\u00a0through jagir grants (Saranjam or Mokasa).\n\nThe army consisted of Infantry (Mavali foot soldiers), Cavalry (Horse riders and equipment holders), and the Navy.\n\nDeath of Shivaji and his legacy\n\nShivaji died at the age of 52 on April 3, 1680, at the Raigad Fort, after suffering from a bout of dysentery.\n\nA conflict of succession arose after his death between his eldest son Sambhaji and his third wife Soyrabai on behalf of her 10-year old son Rajaram.\nSambhaji dethroned the young Rajaram and ascended the throne himself on June 20, 1680.\nThe Mughal-Maratha conflicts continued after Shivaji\u2019s death and the Maratha glory declined greatly.\nLater young Madhavrao Peshwa (1761-1772) reclaimed the Maratha glory and re-established his authority over North India.\nThe Maratha kingdom\n\nShivaji Maharaj (1627-1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families (Deshmukh). Groups of highly mobile, peasant- pastoralists (Kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha army.\n\nPoona became the capital of the Maratha kingdom.\n\nAfter Shivaji, Peshwas developed a very successful military organization by raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas where their supply lines and reinforcements could be easily disturbed.\n\nBy the 1730s, the Maratha king was recognized as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to levy Chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region.\n\nThe frontiers of Maratha domination expanded, after raiding Delhi in 1737, but these areas were not formally included in the Maratha empire but were made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha sovereignty.\n\nThese military campaigns made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas during the third battle of Panipat in 1761.\n\nBy all accounts, cities (Malwa, Ujjain, etc) were large and prosperous and functioned as important ant commercial and cultural centers show the effective administration capacities of Marathas."

The remains of the erstwhile temple can be seen in the foundation, the columns, and the rear part of the mosque.\n\nThe mosque gets its name from a small well in the temple called Gyan Vapi (the well of wisdom).\nDuring the invasion by Aurangzeb, the jyotirlinga is said to have been hidden in the well to protect it from being destroyed.\n\nThe temple was rebuilt again for a fourth time by Raja Jai Singh II of Amer during the later Mughal period (the 1730s). He was the governor and senior mansabdar of the empire at that time and built additional ghats and a Jantar Mantar in Varanasi.\n\n1742: The Maratha ruler Malhar Rao Holkar made a plan to demolish the mosque and reconstruct the temple. However, this plan was intervened by the then Nawab of Awadh.\n\n1780: Malhar Rao\u2019s daughter-in-law Ahilyabai Holkar constructed the present temple adjacent to the mosque.\n\nOver the years many noble and royal families of the subcontinent have made generous contributions to the operations and upkeep of the Kashi Vishwanath temple. In 1835, Maharaja Ranjit Singh donated a 1-tonne gold plating for the temple dome. In 1860 a foot-high stone statue of Nandi Bull was gifted by the Rana of Nepal.\n\nArchitecture:\n\nThe temple is constructed in the Nagara style of temple architecture, mostly prevalent in northern India with pious Jyotirlinga which is a dark brown colored stone enshrined in the Sanctum, placed on a silver platform.\n\nThe main temple is a\u00a0quadrangle in shape and is surrounded by smaller shrines of other gods. There is a small\u00a0well in the temple called the\u00a0Jnana Vapi (the wisdom well) that sits to the north of the main temple. A Sabha Griha or Congregation Hall is leading\u00a0to the inner\u00a0Garbha Griha or Sanctum Sanctorum.\n\nThe Kashi Vishwanath Corridor Project\n\nThe foundation was laid in March 2019 with a budget allotment of 800 crore rupees. The project was conceptualized to create an easily accessible pathway for the pilgrims, who had to make way through congested streets to take a dip in the Ganga and offer the water of the holy river at the temple and restore the glory of the ancient temple.\n\nMore than 40 ancient temples were rediscovered during the work on the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project, which was restored ensuring there is no change in the original structure.\n\nA gallery has been devoted to the excavated remains of the temple complex at the National Museum in New Delhi.\n\nIn Varanasi, smart signages have been erected to provide information on the importance of cultural importance of the heritage sites ad the city\u2019s 84 ghats.\n\nAlso read: Famous Temples in India\n\nSignificance of the project\n\nKashi Vishwanath temple corridor project will help boost tourism by providing the pilgrims and travelers with amenities such as wider and cleaner roads and lanes, better lighting with bright street lights, and clean drinking water.\n\nThe nearby Buddhist pilgrimage site of Sarnath will also get a boost in connection to the tourism boom here.\n\nThe Rudraksha Convention Centre is designed like a Shiva lingam and can seat 1200 people. It has divisible meeting rooms, an art gallery, and multi-purpose pre-function areas.\n\nGanga Cruises have been planned for the tourists, the road infrastructure has been upgraded and LED screens will be installed showing the famous Ganga aarti and aarti at the temple for the tourists.\n\nThe Benaras railway station has been revamped with facilities like an air-conditioned waiting lounge etc.\n\nThis project is also part of the redevelopment of various temples around the country to boost religious and historical tourism.\n\nThe temple, till now, was surrounded by the tiny lanes of Varanasi, and access was huge a problem especially on special occasions when the crowds swelled. Also, the temple lacked direct visibility from the Ganga River. Now, the congested streets have been transformed into spacious alleyways for the ease of tourists."

And in 1839, he successfully cleared his law examination also.\n\nHe passed out of Sanskrit College in Kolkata in 1841 qualifying in Sanskrit grammar, literature, dialectics, Vedanta, Smruti, and Astronomy.\n\nHe joined Fort William College as head of the Sanskrit department at the age of 21.\n\nIn 1846, Vidyasagar joined the Sanskrit College as \u2018Assistant Secretary\u2019 and brought many changes to the existing education system.\n\nThe first change that Vidyasagar made when he came back to the Sanskrit College as a Professor was to include English and Bengali as the medium of learning, besides Sanskrit.\nHe introduced courses of European History, Philosophy, and Science alongside Vedic scriptures.\n\nHe initiated various administrative and educative changes during his tenure as the Principal of Sanskrit College from 1851 to 1858.\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar: The Educationist\u00a0\n\nHe strongly believed that everyone irrespective of caste or gender had the right to education and opened up the premises of the Sanskrit college for people from lower castes.\n\nHe also encouraged scholars to study ancient sacred texts and interpret them for contemporary usage.\n\nHe established 20 model schools in Hooghly, Midnapore, Burdwan, and Nadia.

Their goal was to improve the quality of education for the youth of India.\n\n1884: Deccan Education Society was set up by them to further their goal of educating the youth to make them proficient in English and nationalistic ideology along with Indian culture.

Tilak taught Mathematics here for a while.\n\n1890: Tilak resigned from society and joined the newly formed Congress.\n\nBal Gangadhar Tilak: The Journalist and Politician\n\nTilak turned his attention to public affairs and started two weekly newspapers to awaken the political consciousness of the people-\n\nKesari (in Marathi)\nThe Mahratta (in English)\n\nHe wanted to widen the popularity of the nationalist movement which was mostly confined to the upper classes by introducing the Hindu religious symbolism and invoking Maratha sentiments and traditions of the Maratha struggle against Mughals.\n\nTo build anti-imperialist sentiments he wrote about celebrating the Ganapathi festival and Shivaji festival on large scale.\n\nHe also started akharas, lathi clubs for involving youth more, and anti cow killing societies.\n\n1897: He was prosecuted for sedition for his writings against the provisions of the Epidemic act 1897 for tackling the bubonic plague that had engulfed the Pune region.\n\nTilak had targeted Commissioner Rand, and his writings incited two youth, the Chapekar brothers, in murdering Rand.\nThe trial and sentence of this case earned him the title of \u201cLokmanya\u201d (beloved leader of the people).\nHe was sentenced to 18 months in prison, where he developed his ideas of swaraj for the first time.\n\nTilak\u2019s idea of swaraj was gaining popularity and he became a very important extremist leader of congress in the time being.\n\n1905: Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal- Tilak strongly opposed this move and supported the Bengali demand for annulment of the act. He advocated for the boycott of British goods, which soon became the Swadeshi movement.\n\n1906: Tilak put forward a program of passive resistance\u2013 \u2018Tenets of the new party\u2019 in front of the Congress-to prepare people to sacrifice to gain independence. This form of resistance was later adopted by Gandhiji against the British,\n\n1907: The moderate leaders did not agree to such political actions which led to the Surat split between the moderates and extremists.\n\nThe era of extremists (1905-1917)\n\nBal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Bipin Chandra Pal\u2013 known as the Lal, Bal, Pal\u2013 were the extremist leaders whose writings instilled many revolutionary activities in the country.\n\nLeaders like Aurobindo Ghosh were also related to them and a few secret societies like Anushilan Samiti in Bengal came up during the period.\n\nTilak through his newspapers wrote criticisms against British rule and the moderate nationalists who advocated social reforms along western lines and political reforms along constitutional lines.\n\nHe was against social reforms through the interference of the British rather, he believed that social reforms should be done after the Indians get to self-rule. This view of him caused him to oppose the \u2018age of consent act\u2019 of 1891.\n\n1908: The Surat split of 1907 helped the British government take advantage of the division and again charged Tilak with sedition and inciting terrorism.\n\nHe had defended the actions of Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki wherein they had tried to assassinate district judge Mr. Kingsford in Bengal using bombs.\nTilak was deported to Mandalay, Burma, to serve a six-year prison sentence.\nThe poor conditions of the jail had a bad impact on his health and he was released in 1914.\n\nTilak\u2019s politics had mellowed down after this, which was evident in his support of the British government in World War I, he had also given speeches to encourage youth to support British war efforts.\n\n1916: He established the All India Home rule league in Belgaum with the slogan \u201cSwarajya is my birthright and I shall have it\u201d.\n\nIt worked in Maharashtra (except Bombay), the central provinces, Karnataka, and Berar.\n\nHe also collaborated with the Home Rule organization started by Annie Besant in Madras.\n\nHe rejoined the Congress in 1916 in the Lucknow session, and his good relation with Mohammed Ali Jinnah led to the historic Lucknow Pact between the Muslim League and Congress.\n\n1918: Tilak visited England as the president of the Indian home rule league and garnered support and good relations of the labour party which was emerging as a major stakeholder in British politics.\n\nAlso read: Lucknow Pact\n\nTilak vs Chirol (1919)\nValentine Chirol the editor of London times had published a set of articles in 1910 in a book called \u2018The Indian unrest\u2019 in which he called Tilak the \u201cFather of Indian unrest\u201d.\nTilak filed a defamation court against Chirol in the court of London in 1919- he lost the case.

As a politician, an economist, a lawyer, and a teacher, Tilak was truly the \u201cMaker of Modern India\u201d as Mahatma Gandhi rightly called him."

His father, Debendranath Tagore was a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, a new religious sect in nineteenth-century Bengal which attempted a revival of the ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid down in the Upanishads.\n\nThe Tagore family was a treasure trove of talent in every field. They hosted the publication of literary magazines; theatre and recitals of Bengali and Western classical music featured there regularly. Tagore\u2019s father invited several professional musicians to stay in the house and teach\u00a0Indian Classical music to the children.\n\nTagore\u2019s oldest brother\u00a0Dwijendranath\u00a0was a philosopher and poet. Another brother,\u00a0Satyendranath, was the first Indian appointed to the formerly all-European\u00a0Indian Civil Service. Another brother,\u00a0Jyotitindranath, was a musician, composer, and playwright. His sister\u00a0Swarnakumari\u00a0became a novelist.\n\nAlso read: Modern Indian Sculpture\n\nEducation\n\nRabindra Nath Tagore had his initial education in Oriental Seminary School. But he did not like the conventional education and started studying at home under several teachers. He was mostly trained by his siblings both in literary as well as physical activities like gymnastics and martial arts.\n\nTagore was a child prodigy when it comes to writing as he has started writing and publishing poetry by the age of eight.\n\nIn 1873, at the age of eleven, Tagore and his father left Calcutta to tour India for several months. He visited his father\u2019s Santiniketan estate and Amritsar before reaching the Himalayan hill station of Dalhousie where he read biographies, studied history, astronomy, modern science, and Sanskrit, and examined the classical poetry of Kalidasa.\n\nAt the age of seventeen, he was sent to England for formal law schooling but he did not finish his studies there. He rather took up independent studies of Shakespeare.\n\nHe returned from England in 1880 and regularly published poems, stories, and novels in Bengali, slowly starting to transform Bengali literature.\n\nIn 1883, he married Mrinalini Devi, a child bride as was the tradition in those times.\n\nRabindranath Tagore in Santiniketan\n\nTagore moved to Santiniketan ashram in 1901, where he started an experimental school based on traditional guru-shishya teaching methods from the Upanishads. He hoped that the revival of the ancient methods of teaching will be more beneficial than the British imparted modern education system.\n\nHis wife and two of their children died during this time which left him distraught.\n\nAfter his return from England and during his stay in Santiniketan, Tagore wrote several literary works of poetry, stories, and novels. His works had started gaining immense popularity in India as well as abroad.\n\nIn 1909, Rabindranath Tagore started writing Gitanjali. In 1912, Tagore went to Europe for the second time. On the journey to London, he translated some of his poems/songs from Gitanjali to English. He met William Rothenstein, a noted British painter, in London who was impressed by the poems, made copies, and gave to Yeats and other English poets. Yeats was enthralled and later wrote the introduction to Gitanjali when it was published in September 1912 in a limited edition by the India Society in London. And in 1913, this collection of poems won the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was the first non-European to receive the prestigious award.\n\nIn 1915, he was awarded a knighthood by King George V.\n\nRabindranath Tagore in Independence movement\n\nTagore participated in the Indian nationalist movement from time to time, though in his own non-sentimental and visionary way; and Gandhi, the political father of modern India, was his devoted friend. Tagore came to be recognized as one of the architects of modern India.\n\nIndia\u2019s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, wrote in\u00a0Discovery of India, \u201cTagore and Gandhi have undoubtedly been the two outstanding and dominating figures in the first half of the twentieth century. Tagore\u2019s influence over the mind of India, and especially of successive rising generations has been tremendous. Not Bengali only, the language in which he wrote, but all the modern languages of India have been molded partly by his writings. More than any other Indian, he has helped to bring into harmony the ideals of the East and the West, and broadened the bases of Indian nationalism.\u201d\n\nIn 1905, Viceroy Curzon decided to divide Bengal into two parts. Rabindranath Tagore strongly protested against this decision. Tagore wrote many national songs and attended protest meetings. He initiated the Rakhibandhan ceremony, symbolizing the underlying unity of undivided Bengal.\n\nIn 1919, following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Tagore renounced his knighthood condemning the act. He was a supporter of Gandhiji but he stayed out of politics. He was opposed to nationalism and militarism as a matter of principle, and instead promoted spiritual values and the creation of a new world culture founded in multi-culturalism, diversity, and tolerance.\n\nTagore the educationalist\n\n1n 1921, Rabindranath Tagore established Viswabharati University and gave all his money from Nobel Prize and royalty money from his books to this University.\n\nTagore was quite knowledgeable of Western culture, especially Western poetry and sciences. Tagore had a good grasp of modern \u2013 post-Newtonian \u2013 physics and was well able to hold his own in a debate with Einstein in 1930 on the newly emerging principles of quantum mechanics and chaos. His meetings and tape-recorded conversations with his contemporaries such as Albert Einstein and H.G. Wells, epitomize his brilliance.\n\nIn 1940 Oxford University arranged a special ceremony in Santiniketan and awarded Rabindranath Tagore with a Doctorate of Literature.\n\nLiterary works of Rabindranath Tagore\n\nAlthough Tagore wrote successfully in all literary genres, he was, first of all, a poet.

Tagore also left numerous drawings and paintings, and songs for which he wrote the music himself.\n\nHe also played the title role in his first original dramatic piece- Valmiki Pratibha.\n\nDeath\n\nAfter an extended period of suffering, Tagore died on August 7, 1941, in the same mansion in which he was brought up.\n\nLegacy of Rabindranath Tagore:\n\nRabindranath Tagore changed the way Bengali literature was perceived as he left an everlasting impression on the readers.\n\nMany countries have his statues erected and host many yearly events to pay tribute to the legendary writer.\n\nMany of his works have been made global, thanks to a host of translations by many famous international writers.\n\nThere are five museums dedicated to Tagore. While three of them are situated in India, the remaining two are in Bangladesh. The museums\u2019 house his famous works, and are visited by millions every year."

He wrote under the pen name \u2018Azad\u2019, which later became his identity.\n\nIn 1912, Azad started publishing a weekly called\u00a0\u2018Al-Hilal\u2019 which he used to question British policies. The publication gained such immense popularity among the public that the British had to finally ban it in 1914 under the Press Act.\n\nAzad soon started another weekly,\u00a0\u2018Al-Balagh\u2019 which ran until he was booked under Defence of India Regulations in 1916. The governments of Bombay, Punjab, Delhi, and the United Provinces had banned his entry and he was deported to Bihar until 1920. Despite censoring, he found ways to rebel against British activities through the power of his pen.\n\nHe was a proponent of Hindu-Muslim unity and kept views that were radical and liberal for the Muslims of that time. He propagated his views through his writings and advocated for Indian nationalism and revolutionary ideas based on Hindu-Muslim unity.\n\nAbul Kalam Azad during the Independence movement\n\n1905: \u00a0Azad opposed the Bengal partition of 1905 and became increasingly active in revolutionary activities and was associated with revolutionaries like Aurobindo Ghosh and Shyam Sundar Chakravarty.\n\n1908: Azad\u2019s trip to Egypt, Syria, turkey, and France brought him in contact with many revolutionaries related to the Young Turk movement and the Iranian revolution. This developed and shaped his political views towards nationalism.\n\n1909: He objected to separate electorates for Muslims under the Morley-Minto reforms and wrote extensively against is it in his weekly Al-Hilal.\n\n1916: He was banned and deported to Bihar for his revolutionary writing until 1920. He was released after World War I.\n\n1920: After his release, Azad, already inspired by Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s philosophy of non-cooperation to fight the British, started leading the\u00a0Khilafat Movement, launched by Indian Muslims to demand that the British preserve the authority of the Ottoman Sultan as Caliph of Islam after World War I.\n\nHe supported the Non-cooperation Movement (1920-22) and entered the Indian National Congress during this time. He was elected the president of the All India Khilafat Committee.\n\n1923: At 35, he became the youngest person to become the president of the Indian National Congress.\n\nAzad grew close to Gandhi through their deep passion for religion and simple living. He began to spin his clothes using khadi on the charkha and began frequently living and participating in the ashrams organized by Gandhi. \u00a0Though deeply committed to non-violence himself, Azad also grew close to fellow nationalists like Jawaharlal Nehru, Chittaranjan Das, and Subhas Chandra Bose.\n\n1924: Azad served as president of the 1924 Unity Conference in Delhi, using his position to work to reunite the Swarajists and the Khilafat leaders under the common banner of the Congress.\n\nAzad served on the Congress Working Committee and in the offices of the general secretary and president many times.\n\n1928: Azad endorsed the Nehru Report, which was criticized by the Ali brothers and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Azad endorsed the ending of separate electorates and called for an independent India to be committed to secularism.\n\nAt the Congress session in\u00a0Guwahati, Azad endorsed Gandhi\u2019s call for\u00a0dominion\u00a0status for India within a year.\n\n1930: He participated in Salt Satyagraha and was arrested and jailed for a year and a half.

He was deeply affected by the violence witnessed during the Partition. Azad travelled through the violence-affected regions of Bengal, Assam, and Punjab and contributed to establishing the refugee camps and ensuring the supply of food and other basic resources.\n\nAbul Kalam Azad, the Educationalist\n\n\u2018Maulana\u2019, as Azad was fondly referred to, headed constituent assembly debates which went on to shape many of the policies, especially those related to education. He believed that India as a nation should aspire for high educational standards and never compromise on that count.\n\nHe was an intellectual at par and his dedication to the field of education is unparalleled as he envisages a liberal and humanitarian education system. His idea was a fusion of eastern and western concepts to bring about wholesome and integrated personality to the education system.\n\nIn 1920, Azad along with fellow Khilafat leaders M. A. Ansari and Ajmal Khan founded the Jamila Milia Islamia in Aligarh as higher education institute managed entirely by Indians without any British support.\n\nLife of Abul Kalam after independence\n\nAzad remained a close confidante, supporter, and advisor to prime minister Nehru, and played an important role in framing national policies. Azad masterminded the creation of national programs of school and college construction and spreading the enrolment of children and young adults into schools, to promote universal primary education.\n\nHe was elected to the Lok sabha in 1952 and 1957.\n\nAzad supported Nehru\u2019s socialist economic and industrial policies, as well as the advancing social rights and economic opportunities for women and underprivileged Indians.\n\nIn 1956, he served as president of the\u00a0UNESCO General Conference held in Delhi.\n\nMaulana Azad was strongly against leaving education to the states. He argued that education was a matter of grave importance and the central government should be given this authority to ensure a uniform national standard of education across the country.\n\nThough he was supported by Jawaharlal Nehru and other key members of the constituent assembly, a few felt this was a bad idea given the diversity of our country. They were of the view that a decentralized approach would enable states to make laws about education in their respective states. Ultimately, the issue was resolved by retaining education in the state list but also including entries related to higher education under the union list.\n\nEducation always remained an important issue for Azad.\u00a0On 16 January 1948, Azad had said in a meeting, \u201cWe must not for a moment forget, it is a birthright of every individual to receive at least the basic education without which he cannot fully discharge his duties as a citizen.\u201d\n\nHe also established \u2018the board for adult education to facilitate education among the uneducated adults.\n\nHe founded the Indian Council of Cultural Relations in 1950 to encourage cultural exchange with other nations.\n\nHe also played an important role in establishing the Sahitya Academy, Sangeet Natak Academy, and Lalit Kala Academy for the development of literature, music, dance, and painting respectively.\n\nAzad, the first education minister of independent India\n\nAs the first education minister of the country from 1947 to 1958, Abul Kalam Azad advocated for free and compulsory primary education for all children up to the age of 14 as he believed it was the right of all citizens.\n\nLater, he went on to establish the Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi in 1935 from Aligarh and contributed to the setting up of the IITs, IISc, and School of Planning and Architecture.\n\nHe was also one of the brains behind the University Grants Commission, India\u2019s higher education regulator, and played a key role in the establishment of other educational institutions.\n\nLiterary works by Azad\n\nHe wrote many books like India wins Freedom, Gubhar-e-Khatir, Tazkirah, Tarjumanul Quran, etc.\n\nDeath of Abul Kalam Azad\n\nThe scholar-politician passed away on 22 February 1958.\n\nLegacy of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad\n\nMaulana Abul Kalam Azad was a strong believer in the co-existence of all religious communities.\n\nHis contributions to the field of education in India are incomparable, hence his birthday, 11 November, is celebrated as National Education Day.\n\nIn 1992, he was posthumously conferred the Bharat Ratna, India\u2019s highest civilian award.\n\nThe Ministry of Minority Affairs of the Central Government of India set up the Maulana Azad Education Foundation in 1989 on the occasion of his birth centenary to promote education amongst educationally backward sections of the Society.\n\nThe Ministry also provides the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad National Fellowship, an integrated five-year fellowship in the form of financial assistance to students from minority communities to pursue higher studies such as M. Phil and PhD."

East Bengal was Muslim dominant region while the west was Hindu-dominated.\n\nAfter the 1947 partition of India, East Bengal became a province of Pakistan and was called East Pakistan then onwards. The east and west Pakistan were not only separated geographically, but they differed in language, culture, etc also. This led to problems in governance as well.

However, west Pakistan was not willing to let a leader from its eastern provincial wing rule the country.\n\nRiots exploded in the province and using this instability as an excuse, the central government established the governor\u2019s rule in the province overturning the election results.\n\nIn 1956, Pakistan finally got its constitution, and Pakistan was declared the Islamic Republic. The national parliament was to comprise of one house with equal representation from east and West Pakistan.\n\n6 point movement, 1966\nThis was a movement in east Pakistan spearheaded by Mujibir Rahman demanding greater autonomy for the region.\nTheir 6 demands were: Federal state, all subjects except defence and foreign affairs, separate currency and fiscal policy, taxation powers, trade, and forex reserves, separate military and navy.\n\nAgartala conspiracy case, 1968: Mujibur Rahman went to Agartala to seek Indian support for East Pakistan\u2019s independence. Pakistan charged him with sedition and conspiring with India charges.\n\n1970 Cyclone Bhola caused floods and 3-5 lakhs deaths in East Pakistan, but the Yahya Khan\u2019s government did not provide adequate relief. This added to the animosity between the two regions.\n\nThe 1970 election again saw sweeping victory by the Awami League, but Zulfikar Bhutto-led PPP who won in West Pakistan refused to acknowledge Mujibur Rahman\u2019s win.\n\nThis led to civil disobedience and a call for independence in Dhaka and on 23 March 1971 flag of Bangladesh was raised for the first time.\n\nOperation Searchlight\nOn 25th March 1971, the Pakistan army struck at the Bengali independence movement at night.\nMujibur Rahman was arrested and flown to West Pakistan, many Bengali students and intellectuals were fired upon and arrested in Dhaka University.\nThis resulted in millions of Bangladeshis fleeing to India, mainly West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura.\nWest Bengal was massively burdened by the rush of the refugees and the state appealed to the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for assistance for food and shelter.\nBengali resistance- the Mukhti Bahini\n\nThe Bengali armed resistance Mukhti Bahini arose against the Pakistan army and the Indian forces helped them with arms and training.\n\nIndia had a very crucial geopolitical motive to help Bangladesh due to the turbulent relationship with Pakistan. A win for the Bengali movement meant a peaceful eastern frontier for India. And as an immediate reason, the refugee crisis was becoming a huge economic burden for India.\n\nOn the global scale, the U.S \u2013Soviet tensions were high.

Bangladesh is India\u2019s largest trading partner in South Asia and one of the fastest-growing economies. Indian firms have huge investment opportunities in the country due to their growth potential.

The Congress party at that time consisted of moderates and elites, and Nehru immediately doubted the effect they could have on Indian society. But he agreed to work with the party in support of the Indian Civil Rights movement led by Gandhi in South Africa.\n\n1914-15: World War I broke out and there were feelings among Indians regarding the war. Nehru worked as a volunteer for the St. John Ambulance during the war.\n\nNehru grew through the war years as a leader whose political views were considered radical. The political discourse at the time had been dominated by moderates like Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who considered independence a far-fetched idea.\n\nThe death of Gokhale in 1915 led to the fading out of moderate ideology and the political stage was taken over by radical leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Annie Besant who started the Home Rule movement.\n\n1916: Jawaharlal Nehru met Gandhi Ji for the first time in the Lucknow session of Congress.

The Congress party decided to contest the provincial elections of 1937 despite disagreement from Nehru and Gandhi Ji.\n\nNehru wanted to elevate Maulana Azad, who was also socialist, as the voice of Indian Muslims, but Gandhiji\u2019s support of Jinnah and the Muslim league undermined this view of Nehru.\n\n1939: World War II broke out and Viceroy Linlithgow declared India into war without consulting the Indian representatives.\n\nThe Congress under Nehru informed the government that it would cooperate with the British but on certain conditions, but the Viceroy rejected the conditions.\n\nOn 23 October 1939, Congress called upon the Congress ministries in the various provinces to resign in protest. \u00a0Before this crucial announcement, Nehru urged Jinnah and the Muslim League to join the protest, but Jinnah declined.\n\nCivil disobedience, Lahore resolution, and August offer\n\n1940: Jinnah and the Muslim League also passed the Pakistan resolution in 1940, demanding a separate Muslim nation called Pakistan.\n\nLinlithgow made the August offer to Nehru offering domino status to India in return for support in World War II. The Indian leaders rejected the offer calling it incomplete and vague.\n\nNehru was arrested for offering individual Satyagraha to protest against India\u2019s forced participation in the war. He was released along with the other leaders in December 1941.\n\nThe Japanese attack, Cripps Mission, and Quit India movement\n\nIn 1942, Japan attacked India through Burma, and the British threatened by the attack decided to hold talks with Indian Leaders.\n\nPrime Minister Winston Churchill dispatched Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the British War Cabinet who was politically close to Nehru and also knew Jinnah, with proposals for a settlement of the constitutional problem. Cripps\u2019s mission failed, however, for Indian leaders under Gandhi and Nehru would accept nothing less than independence.\n\n1942: Nehru moved the historic \u2018Quit India\u2019 resolution at the All India Congress Committee session in Bombay.\n\nOn August 8, 1942, he was arrested along with other leaders and taken to Ahmednagar Fort. This was the longest and last of his detentions.\n\n1945: He was released in January, after which he organized legal defense for the officers and men of the Indian National Army (INA) charged with treason.\n\n1946: He was elected President of the Congress for the fourth time on July 6, 1946, and again for three more terms from 1951 to 1954.\n\nCabinet mission and the interim government\n\nA final attempt was made by the viceroy Wavell to bring the Congress Party and the Muslim League together, which failed. The Labour government that had meanwhile displaced Churchill\u2019s wartime administration sent a Cabinet Mission to India and later replaced Lord Wavell with Lord Mountbatten.\n\n1946: The Cabinet Mission was sent to India to propose a plan for the transfer of power. This led to elections to provincial assemblies, and members elected members of the constituent assembly. An interim government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru as Prime Minister. The Muslim league joined the government later with Liaquat Ali Khan as Finance minister.\n\nOn August 15, 1947, India and Pakistan were partitioned as two separate independent countries.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru: The first Prime Minister of India\n\nJawaharlal Nehru took office as Prime Minister of independent India on 15th August and his inaugural address was called \u2018Tryst with Destiny\u2019.\n\n1947: Nehru declares that no princely state would exist in independent India and that they need to join the constituent assembly. He made Vallabhbai Patel and V.P. Menon in charge of integrating the states, in which they were successful.\n\n1950: The new Constitution of India came into force on 26th January 1950 making India a sovereign democratic republic.\n\n1952: The first elections under the new constitution of India were held. Congress Party under Nehru\u2019s leadership won the elections and formed the first elected government of the Republic of India.\n\n1952-57: Second Nehru Ministry at the Centre\n\nJawaharlal Nehru appointed the States Reorganization Commission in 1953 to organize states on a linguistic basis. This commission was headed by Justice Fazal Ali.\n\nHe advocated democratic socialism and encouraged India\u2019s industrialization by implementing the first five-year plans. He attempted to push the development by undertaking both agrarian reforms and industrialization together.\n\n1958-62: Third Nehru Ministry at the Centre\n\nThe Congress party won the 1957 and later 1962 elections as well. Nehru served as Prime Minister of India for three consecutive terms, for 17 years.\n\nHe annexed Goa into India from the Portuguese occupation in 1961 after years of failed negotiations. He was lauded and criticized for the use of force internally and externally.\n\nThe Sino-Indian War of 1962 was a troubled time under his last term as Prime Minister.\n\nDeath of Jawaharlal Nehru\n\nHe died of a heart attack on 27\u00a0May 1964.\n\nLal Bahadur Shastri took over as the second Prime Minister of India.\n\nNehru\u2019s legacy\n\nNehru was popular among the citizens of India as well on a global level. His secular approach to politics contrasted with Gandhi\u2019s religious and traditionalist attitude. Because of his modern political and economic outlook, he was able to attract the younger intellectual crowd of India to the independence movement against the British.\n\nNehru embarked India on modern lines while keeping in touch with traditional Indian aspects. He imparted modern values and ways of thinking, which he adapted to Indian conditions.\n\nHe stressed secularism and the basic unity of India, despite its ethnic and religious diversities. He was deeply concerned with carrying India forward into the modern age of scientific discovery and technological development.\n\nNehru wanted his people to have an awareness and social concern for the poor and the outcast and respect for democratic values.\n\nHe was particularly proud of the reform of the ancient Hindu civil code that finally enabled Hindu\u00a0widows\u00a0to enjoy equality with men in matters of inheritance and property.\n\nThe Kashmir problem remained a\u00a0perennial throughout Nehru\u2019s term as prime minister.\n\nHe had a great love for children and was fondly called Chacha Nehru. His birthday is celebrated as Children\u2019s Day in India.\n\nHe encouraged and advanced India\u2019s education by establishing the top-tier institutions of India including the Indian Institute of Technology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India\u2019s first Space Program, etc.\n\nHis former residence, the Trimurti Bhavan has been converted into a museum giving a glimpse of the former prime minister\u2019s life.\n\nInternational relations under Nehru\n\nHis most important contribution to geopolitics is considered the Non-alignment moment (NAM). India and a few other countries decided to not align with any superpower during the Cold War era post World War II.\n\nHowever, Nehru\u2019s popularity saw a decline when India was the only nonaligned country to vote with the Soviet Union on the invasion of Hungary in the United Nations. At last, the Sino-Indian War of 1962 forced Nehru to divert fully from the NAM to procure help from the Western forces.\n\nIn 1954, Nehru signed the Five Principles of Coexistence with China known as Panchsheel in India. India recognized Chinese sovereignty over Tibet with this. Relations with China under Nehru\u2019s leadership saw many ups and downs throughout.\n\nLiterary works by Nehru\n\nHe authored many books in his lifetime, to name a few-\n\nThe Discovery of India\nGlimpses of the world\nAn Autobiography\nLetters from a father to his daughter\n\nAll through his 17 years in the prime minister\u2019s office, he held up democratic socialism, emphasizing that India needed to achieve both democracy and socialism. The four pillars of his domestic policies were democracy, socialism, unity, and secularism. He successfully integrated these pillars into the building of modern India.\n\nAlso read: August Offer: A breakpoint in India\u2019s freedom struggle"

They served as warriors and were charged with policing functions during peacetime. The Paikas were organized into three ranks distinguished by their occupation and the weapons they wielded-\n\nThe Paharis, the bearers of shields and the\u00a0khanda sword\nThe Banuas who led distant expeditions and used\u00a0matchlocks\u00a0and\nThe Dhenkiyas were the\u00a0archers\u00a0who also performed different duties in Odisha armies.\n\nThe conquest of Odisha by the East India Company in 1803 dethroned the king of Khurda, and with this, the power and prestige of the Paikas began to decline.\n\nWhat were the causes of the Paika rebellion?\n\nThe origins of the Paika Rebellion lay in several social, economic, and political causes.\n\nThe East India Company closed Odisha\u2019s four trading ports to protect their trade interests which isolated the local population.\nThe educated and wealthy local administrators and the Paikas were alienated by the East India Company administration, who took over the hereditary rent-free lands from them after the conquest of Khurda.\nThe Paikas were also subjected to extortion by the Company administration and its servants. The extortionist land revenue policy of the Company affected the peasants and the zamindars alike.\nThe rise in prices of salt due to taxes\u00a0imposed on it\u00a0by the Company administration troubled the common people.\nThe East India Company also abolished the system of cowrie currency that had existed in Odisha before its conquest and enforced tax payment in silver.\n\nIn 1804 the Raja of Khurda planned a rebellion against the Company in alliance with the Paikas, but the plot was discovered and the Raja\u2019s territory confiscated.\n\nLeaders and course of rebellion:\n\nThe Paika Rebellion was led by\u00a0Bakshi Jagabandhu, the former\u00a0Bakshi\u00a0or commander of the forces of the Raja of Khurda.\n\nRaja Mukunda Deva, the last King of Khurda was another leader of the Paika rebels.\n\nThe rebellion had widespread support in Oriya society with feudal chiefs, zamindars, and the common people of Odisha participating in it.\n\nThe zamindars of Karipur, Mrichpur, Golra, Balarampur, Budnakera and Rupasa supported the Paikas. While the rebellion started from Banapur and Khurda, it quickly spread to other parts of Odisha like Puri, Pipili, Cuttack, and several remote villages, including Kanika, Kujang, and Pattamundai.\n\nThe Rajas of Kanika, Kujang,\u00a0Nayagarh\u00a0and Ghumusur aided Jagabandhu and Dalabehera Mirhaidar Alli of Jadupur was an important Muslim rebel.\n\nThe Paikas attacked British symbols of power, blazing police stations, administrative offices, and the treasury during their march towards Khurda.\n\nBritish were initially taken aback and faced stiff resistance from the rebelling Paikas. However, the Paikas were eventually defeated by the British.\n\nThe Paikas retreated into the thick jungles of Odisha and carried out guerrilla warfare for several years. After successive defeats, the Paika leader, Bakshi Jagabandhu, surrendered to the British in 1825 and lived as a prisoner in Cuttack till his death in 1829.\n\nThe outcome of the rebellion:\n\nThe rebels were imprisoned for life or given death sentences by the British administration. \u00a0The British also appointed a commission to look into the rebellion.\n\nThere were several smaller uprisings post the Paika rebellion, but all these were suppressed by the English.\n\nThe revenue and taxation system did not change after the rebellion, hence the rebellion failed to have any effect in bringing change.\n\nYet, the Paika rebellion was a widespread rebellion challenging British supremacy and has even been called the first war for independence before the revolt of 1857."

In this system, students lived with the teacher or \u2018guru\u2019 in the same house. However, even at that time, India was reputed for many global universities like Nalanda.\n\nThe colonial conquest led to the fall of the education system in India. For the initial sixty-odd years, the British did not pay any heed to advancing the education system in the country.

He had famously said that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d.\n\nThe gist of the minute is:\n\nGovernment should spend resources for teaching western sciences and literature in English alone.\nEnglish should be made the medium of education in schools and colleges.\nElementary schools were not given importance, rather more schools at district levels and colleges were suggested to be opened.

He enrolled there at \u2018Gray\u2019s Inn Law College\u2019.\n\nThe professional and political life of Veer Savarkar\n\nHe was greatly inspired by leaders like\u00a0Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Bipin Chandra Pal and by the protests against the partition of Bengal and the Swadeshi movement.\n\nHe was a staunch patriot who was involved in political activities at high school and college and was attracted to radical views and movements. He and his brother Ganesh Damodar Savarkar founded a secret society called\u00a0\u2018Mitra Mela\u2019 in 1899 which later became \u2018Abhinav Bharat Society\u2019 in 1904.\n\nIn London, he established the Free India Society along with Madam Bhikaji Cama to organize students to fight for India\u2019s independence through a revolution.\n\nSavarkar was a friend and guide to Madan Lal Dhingra who assassinated Curzon Wyllie, a British army officer. Even though Dhingra was executed by the British, Savarkar continued the further revolution.\n\nThe History of the War of Indian Independence\n\n1909: During this time, he authored a book\u00a0\u201cThe History of the War of Indian Independence\u201d.\n\nIt was Veer Savarkar who first named the 1857 rebellion the first war of independence. He\u00a0referred to British rule as unjust and oppressive.\n\nThe book was banned by the British, but\u00a0Madam Bhikaji Cama published the book in the Netherlands, Germany, and France, which eventually gained popularity among many Indian revolutionaries.\n\nHe also led an armed revolt against the Morley-Minto reforms during this time.\n\nArrest and mercy petitions\n\nIn 1910, Savarkar was arrested and ordered to be extradited to India for his connections with the revolutionary group India House.\n\nOn return to India, Savarkar was sentenced to two life terms of imprisonment totalling 50 years and was moved to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 1911.\n\nHe filed multiple mercy petitions and his release was also demanded by national leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Tilak.\n\nIn 1921, he was transferred to a jail in Ratnagiri and then to the Yerwada Jail in Pune.\n\nHe was released in 1924 but could not move out of Ratnagiri or engage in political activities for five years.\n\nEssentials of Hindutva\n\nDuring his incarceration in Ratnagiri jail in 1922, he wrote his \u201cEssentials of Hindutva\u201d that formulated his theory of Hindutva.\n\nHe was a self-proclaimed atheist but a staunch believer of Hindutva and he believed all the religions are the same and can come together to form the Akhand Bharat (Unified or Great India).\n\nHe later joined Tilak\u2019s Swaraj Party and gave instigating patriotic speeches against the British Government. As a result,\u00a0the British Government withdrew his B.A. degree.\n\nHe advocated for the use of Hindi as a national language. He also fought against untouchability and caste-based discrimination.\n\nSavarkar\u2019s contributions as a social reformer\n\nSavarkar built Patit Pavan Mandir in the Ratnagiri district to allow entry to all Hindus, including Dalits.\n\nAccording to Savarkar, the rigid caste system \u201cdeserves to be thrown into the dustbins of history\u201d.\n\nSavarkar wanted to break away from caste-based vocational rigidity and encourage persons to pursue any vocation of their choice based on aptitude and ability. In the absence of motivation of competition, or lack of aptitude, Savarkar believed, \u201cmerely following what one\u2019s father did, will make one both complacent and unproductive.\u201d\n\nSavarkar wanted to break away from the taboo on inter-caste dining. He had said, \u201cReligion is in the heart, the soul, the spirit; not the stomach!\u201d He also promoted inter-caste marriage.\n\nVeer Savarkar wanted to popularize Vedic literature to everyone, not only to a particular caste. He called Vedic literature civilizational knowledge for the entire human race and India\u2019s unique gift to mankind.\n\nSavarkar believed in global mobility and the need for Indians to venture out into foreign lands so as to \u201cbring back the best of the world and carry the fragrance of India and her culture to every corner of the globe.\u201d\n\nVeer Savarkar underscored was the need to develop a scientific temper. \u201cWe are 200 years behind Europe\u201d, he had remarked adding, \u201cIt is through science, modern thoughts and industrialization that we can ensure that every man woman in India will have a job to do, food to eat, clothes to wear and a happy life to lead.\u201d\n\nSavarkar and Hindu Mahasabha\n\nIn 1937, Savarkar became the president of the Hindu Mahasabha (till 1943).\n\nIt was founded by Veer Damodar Savarkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, Madan Mohan Malviya in 1933.\n\nThe organization was formed to protect the rights of the Hindu community, after the formation of the All India Muslim League in 1906 and the British India government\u2019s creation of a separate Muslim electorate under the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909.\n\nSavarkar as president of the Hindu Mahasabha decided to support the British war effort in India seeking military training for the Hindus during the Second World War.\n\nHe gave the slogan \u201cHinduize all Politics and Militarize Hindudom\u201d.\n\nOpposing stand during the Quit India Movement\n\nUnder Savarkar, the Hindu Mahasabha openly opposed the call for the Quit India Movement and boycotted it officially. He asked all the Hindu sabha members in the government to support the British government instead.\n\nHindu Mahasabha also opposed Gandhi\u2019s initiative to hold talks with Jinnah in 1944. Savarkar strongly attacked the British and Congress for making concessions for the Muslim separatists.\n\nAfter the resignation of the Congress ministries in protest of Linlithgow\u2019s decision to drag India into WWII without their consultation, the Hindu Mahasabha, under Savarkar\u2019s presidency, joined hands with the Muslim League and other parties to form governments, in certain provinces like Sindh, NWFP, and Bengal.\n\nThe \u2018two nations in one country\u2019 theory\n\nWhen he gave \u2018the two nations in one country\u2019 theory, he propounded that the Hindus and Muslims, though different can bury their differences and unite for India.\n\nThat\u2019s the reason he had opposed INC\u2019s acceptance of the partition of India. Note: The two nations theory adopted by Jinnah was given by Sir Syed Ahmed khan.\n\nThe assassination of Mahatma Gandhi: The charge and acquittal\n\nIn 1948, he was charged as the co-conspirator for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nNathuram Godse was a member of Hindu Mahasabha and a prolific follower of Savarkar\u2019s ideas.\n\nSavarkar was however later acquitted from the charge due to lack of evidence.\n\nPost-Independence India and Savarkar\n\nHe was under the constant scrutiny of the public after Gandhiji\u2019s assassination.\n\nLater, he was also arrested by the government for making \u201cHindu nationalist speeches\u201d but was released after agreeing to give up political activities. He continued addressing the social and cultural elements of Hindutva.\n\nAfter the death of his wife in 1963, from February 1966, Savarkar gave up consuming food, water, and medicines. According to him, giving up life when one was no longer useful to society was better than waiting for death.\n\nHe died on February 26, 1966, due to ill health.\n\nLegacy of Veer Savarkar:\n\nSavarkar was the first political leader to set independence as India\u2019s goal in the 1900s. Almost immediately after joining college, he had started organizing and spreading his anti-British and revolutionary ideas through his efficient oratory and writing skills.\n\nHe was also known as Swantantryaveer or Veer Savarkar which was earned due to his courageous behaviour.\n\nHe was a proponent of a united India, which was inclusive and diverse \u2014 an India that was an organic result of all its diverse cultures. He believed in the idea of inclusivity for mobilizing the Indian masses.\n\nSavarkar also openly embraced the \u201cEra of Machines\u201d and warned the Indian leaders to learn from Europe\u2019s mistakes.\n\nHis futuristic approach to Indian cinema, too, was commendable. He believed in the innovative spirit of the human mind.\n\nEven though his ideology on Hindu Rashtra and Hindutva is controversial, Savarkar\u2019s ideas of modernity, social and religious reforms, cultivation of scientific temper, and embracing technological tools continue to be relevant for building a new India.\n\nSome of his other literary works include:\n\nSix Glorious Epochs of Indian History\nMy Transportation for Life\nKale Pani\n1857 che Svatantrya Samar\nMaazi Janmathep\nMoplyanche Banda (about Moplah rebellion of 1921)\nHindu Rashtra Darshan"

What were the landmark events that shaped the press in India? Read to know all about it.\n\nThe British are attributed to introducing independent press or participatory journalism in India during the colonial period.\n\nBut the British administration put more effort into curbing the Indian press to restrict the nationalistic sentiments propagated through them.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of Press in India during British rule\nImportant journals or newspapers vs their authors:\nHistory of Press in India during British rule\n\nHere is a brief history of the development of the press before independence.\n\n1780: James Augustus Hickey started \u2018The Bengal Gazette\u2019 also known as \u2018Calcutta General advertiser\u2019. This was the first newspaper published in India which was later stopped because it carried critical articles against the company.\n\n1799: Governor-General Richard Wellesley enacted the\u00a0Censorship of Press Act, 1799 to stop the French from publishing anything against the British. This act brought all the newspapers under Government scrutiny before their publication. This act was later extended in 1807 and covered all kinds of Press Publications newspapers, magazines, books, and Pamphlets. The rules were relaxed in 1818 when\u00a0Francis Hastings (1813-1823) assumed office.\n\n1823: Licensing Regulation ordinance was brought out by acting Governor-General John Adams. This regulation made press without a license a penal offence. The restriction was directed mainly at Indian-language newspapers or those edited by the Indians. This caused Raja Ram Mohun Roy to repeal his Persian journal \u2018Mirat-ul-akhbar\u2019 started in 1822.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\n1824: Raja Ram Mohun Roy protested against the restriction on freedom of the press.\n\n1835: Press act or Metcalfe act, repealed the Licensing regulations of 1823. Gov.Gen. Metcalfe came to be known as the \u2018liberator of the press\u2019 in India. The act required a printer/publisher to give a precise account of the premises of a publication and cease functioning if required by a similar declaration. The result of a liberal press policy was the rapid growth of newspapers.\n\n1857: Licensing act was enacted by Gov. Gen Canning (later Viceroy in 1858) after the Revolt of 1857 to impose stricter restrictions on the press. The right to stop the publication and circulation of any book, newspaper or printed matter was reserved with the Government.\n\n1867: The registration act replaced the Metcalfe act of 1835. The act was said to introduce regulations and no restrictions on the press. The print media now was made to contain the name of the printer, publisher, and place of publication and a copy had to be submitted to the government.\n\n1878: Vernacular Press act by Viceroy Lytton was enacted to curtail the freedom of Indian language newspapers (this law did not apply to English language papers). This was the result of the racial bitterness that has grown between then Indians and Europeans after the incidents of 1857.\n\nThe district magistrate was given powers to make the printer and publisher of any vernacular newspaper enter into a bond with the Government stating not to cause disaffection against the government or antipathy between persons of different religions, caste, and races through published material.\nThe printer and publisher could also be required to deposit security which could be seized if the above offences reoccurred.\nThe magistrate\u2019s action was final and no appeal could be made in a court of law.\nA vernacular newspaper could get an exemption from the operation of the Act by submitting proof to a government censor.\n\n1882: The pre-censorship of the Vernacular press act was repealed by Viceroy Ripon.\n\n1908: Newspaper (incitement to offence) Act gave the magistrates power to confiscate press property that published objectionable material likely to cause incitement to murder or acts of violence. This act was triggered by the Extremist nationalist activity during and after the Swadeshi movement of 1906.\n\n1910: Indian press act was a revision of the Vernacular Press Act that empowered the local government to demand a large amount of security at registration from the printer/publisher and forfeit/deregister of newspapers that considered anti-government, and the printer of a newspaper was required to submit two copies of each issue to local government.\n\n1921: The acts of 1908 and 1910 were repealed on the recommendation of the Press committee chaired by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru.\n\n1931: Indian Press (emergency powers) Act was enacted in the wake of the Civil disobedience movement. It gave powers to the provincial government to suppress propaganda writings in the support of Civil Disobedience movement.\n\nImportant journals or newspapers vs their authors:\nBengal gazette\u00a0 \u2013 J.A Hickey\nMaharatta (English), Kesari (Marathi) \u2013 Bal Gangadhar Tilak\nHitavada \u2013 Gopal Krishna Gokhale\nSudharak \u2013 Gopal Ganesh Agarkar\nVoice of India, Rast Goftar \u2013 Dadabai Naororji\nVande Mataram, Paridasak \u2013 Bipin Chandra Pal\nMook Nayak, Janata, Bahishkrut bharat \u2013 Dr. B.R amberdkar\nPrabuddha Bharata \u2013 Aiyasami, B.

A sense of oneness has been there for ages \u2013 even though most of the centralised administration in India didn\u2019t last long.\n\nWith the end of Mughal rule, India broke into hundreds of princely states.\u00a0 The British \u2013 which were instrumental in the fall of the Mughal Empire \u2013 held control over the princely states and created the British Indian Empire.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nHowever, most Indians were extremely dissatisfied with the exploitative foreign rule.\n\nThe educated Indians realised that the British always gave priority to their colonial interests and treated India only as a market.\n\nThey advocated for the political independence of India.\n\nFoundation of Indian National Congress (INC) in 1885\n\nThe late nineteenth century witnessed the emergence of many political organisations in British India.\n\nIndian National Congress (also known as Congress Party) founded in 1885 was the most prominent one.\n\nInitially, its aim was to create a platform for civic and political dialogue between Indians and the British Raj and thus obtain a greater share of government for educated Indians.\n\nLater, under the leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawarhal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Sardar Vallabhai Patel, the Congress party played a central role in organising mass movements against the British.\n\nPartition of Bengal (1905)\n\nIndian nationalism was gaining in strength and Bengal was the nerve centre of Indian nationalism in the early 1900s.\n\nLord Curzon, the Viceroy (1899-1905), attempted to \u2018dethrone Calcutta\u2019 from its position as the centre from which the Congress Party manipulated throughout Bengal, and indeed, the whole of India.\n\nThe decision to partition Bengal into two was in the air from December 1903.\n\nCongress party \u2013 from 1903 to mid-1905 \u2013 tried moderate techniques of petitions, memoranda, speeches, public meetings and press campaigns. The objective was to turn to public opinion in India and England against the partition.\n\nHowever, Viceroy Curzon 1905 formally announced the British Government\u2019s decision for the partition of Bengal on 19 July 1905. The partition took effect on 16 October 1905.\n\nThe partition was meant to foster another kind of division \u2013 on the basis of religion. The aim was to place Muslim communalists as a counter to the Congress. Curzon promised to make Dacca the new capital.\n\nThis resulted in a lot of discontent among the Indians. Many considered this as a policy of \u2018Divide and Rule\u2019 by the British.\n\nThis triggered a self-sufficiency movement popularly known as the Swadeshi movement.\n\nAlso read: Dr. Rajendra Prasad: Architect of the Indian Republic\n\nThe Swadeshi Movement (1905-1908)\n\nFrom conservative moderation to political extremism, from terrorism to incipient socialism, from petitioning and public speeches to passive resistance and boycott, all had their origins in the movement.\n\nSwadeshi is a conjunction of two Sanskrit words: swa (\u201cself\u201d) and desh (\u201ccountry\u201d).\n\nThe movement popularised the use and consumption of indigenous products. Indians started ditching British goods for Indian products.\n\nWomen, students, and a large section of the urban and rural population of Bengal and other parts of India became actively involved in politics for the first time with Swadeshi Movement.\n\nThe message of Swadeshi and the boycott of foreign goods soon spread to the rest of the country.\n\nThe militant nationalists led by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Lajpat Rai and Aurobindo Ghosh were in favour of extending the movement to the rest of India and carrying it beyond the programme of just Swadeshi and boycott to a full-fledged political mass struggle. For them, the aim was Swaraj.\n\nIn 1906, the Indian National Congress at its Calcutta Session presided over by Dadabhai Naoroji, declared that the goal of the Indian National Congress was \u2018self-government or Swaraj like that of the United Kingdom or the Colonies.\n\nThere were differences in the ideologies of the congressmen who were popularly known by the names Moderates and the Extremists. They had differences of opinion regarding the pace of the movement and the techniques of struggle to be adopted. This came to a head in the 1907 Surat session of the Congress where the party split (the two factions re-joined later).\n\nThis period also saw a breakthrough in Indian art, literature, music, science and industry.\n\nIt was, perhaps, in the cultural sphere that the impact of the Swadeshi Movement was most marked. The songs composed at that time by Rabindranath Tagore, Rajani Kanta Sen etc became the moving spirit for nationalists of all hues.\n\nIn art, this was the period when Abanindranath Tagore broke the domination of Victorian naturalism over Indian art and sought inspiration from the rich indigenous traditions of Mughal, Rajput and Ajanta paintings.\n\nIn science, Jagdish Chandra Bose, Prafulla Chandra Ray, and others pioneered original research that was praised the world over.\n\nThe Swadeshi period also saw the creative use of traditional popular festivals and melas as a means of reaching out to the masses. The Ganapati and Shivaji festivals, popularized by Tilak, became a medium for Swadeshi propaganda not only in Western India but also in Bengal.\n\nAnother important aspect of the Swadeshi Movement was the great emphasis given to self-reliance or \u2018Atmasakti\u2019in various fields meant the re-asserting of national dignity, honour and confidence.\n\nSelf-reliance also meant an effort to set up Swadeshi or indigenous enterprises. The period saw a mushrooming of Swadeshi textile mills, soap and match factories etc.\n\nOne of the major features of the programme of self-reliance was Swadeshi or National Education. In 1906, the National Council of Education was established. The vernacular medium was given stress from the primary to university level.\n\nCorps of volunteers (or samitis as they were called) were another major form of mass mobilization widely used by the Swadeshi Movement. The Swadesh Bandhab Samiti set up by Ashwini Kumar Dutt was the most well-known volunteer organization of them all.\n\nReasons for the failure of the Swadeshi Movement\nThe main drawback of the Swadeshi Movement was that it was not able to garner the support of the mass. The British use of communalism to turn the Muslims against the Swadeshi Movement was to a large extent responsible for this.\nDuring the Swadeshi phase, the peasantry was not organized around peasant demands. The movement was able to mobilize the peasantry only in a limited way.\nBy mid-1908 repression took the form of controls and bans on public meetings, processions and the press.\nThe internal squabbles, and especially, the split in the Congress (1907), the apex all-India organization, weakened the movement.\nThe Swadeshi Movement lacked an effective organization and party structure.\nLastly, the movement declined because of the very logic of mass movements itself \u2014 they cannot be sustained endlessly.\n\nHowever, the movement made a major contribution in taking the idea of nationalism, in a truly creative fashion, to many sections of the people. The peasant participation in the Swadeshi Movement even though less, marked the very beginnings of modern mass politics in India.\n\nAlso read: Ghadar Party\n\nThe Split in the Congress (1907)\n\nThe main public leaders of the two wings, Tilak (of the Extremists) and Gokhale (of the Moderates) were aware of the dangers of disunity in the nationalist ranks.\n\nA split was avoided in 1906 by choosing Dadabhai Naoroji as president of INC in the Calcutta session. Also, four compromise resolutions on the Swadeshi, Boycott, National Education, and Self-Government demands were passed. However, the hope of a united Congress was short-lived.\n\nThe Extremists wanted to extend the Swadeshi and the Boycott Movement from Bengal to the rest of the country but the Moderators opposed it.\n\nThe Extremists were fumed by the rumours that the Moderates wanted to scuttle the four Calcutta resolutions. This created friction among them which led to the split at the Congress session was held on 26 December 1907 at Surat, on the banks of the river Tapti.\n\nThe Indian National Congress split in December 1907. By 1907, the Moderate nationalists had exhausted their historical role. They failed to meet the demands of the new stage of the national movement and even failed to attract the younger generation.\n\nAlmost at the same time, revolutionary terrorism made its appearance in Bengal.\n\nBritain\u2019s policy towards\u00a0 INC\nThe British had been suspicious of the National Congress from its inception but they were not overtly hostile either.\nIn 1888 Viceroy Dufferin ridiculed INC as representing only the elite \u2014 \u2018a microscopic minority\u2019.\nLord Curzon said: \u201cThe Congress is tottering to its fall, and one of my greatest ambitions while in India is to assist it to a peaceful demise.\u201d\nThe intimidating policies of the British towards INC changed once the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement began. The strengthening of the militant nationalist trend alarmed the British.\nA new policy, known as the policy of the carrot and the stick was invoked. It was three-pronged. It was described as a policy of repression-conciliation-suppression.\nThe Extremists were repressed, though mildly in the first stage. The purpose is to frighten the Moderates. The British also tried to pacify Moderates through some concessions and promises if they disassociated themselves from the Extremists. However, the British always wanted to suppress Extremists.\nMinto-Morley constitutional reforms (1909)\n\nThe Government of India which was headed by Lord Minto as Viceroy and John Morley as the Secretary of State offered fresh reforms in the Legislative Councils. They began discussions with Moderates within Indian National Congress regarding this. However,\u00a0when the decision was taken, not just Moderates but the country as a whole were disappointed.\n\nMajor Provisions:\n\nThe Indian Councils Act of 1909 increased the number of elected members (but most of them were still indirectly elected) in the Imperial Legislative Council and the provincial legislative councils.\nAn Indian was to be appointed a member of the Governor-General\u2019s Executive Council.\nThe Act permitted members to introduce resolutions; it also increased their power to ask questions.\nVoting on separate budget items was allowed.\n\nThe real purpose of the Morley-Minto Reforms was to divide the nationalist ranks and encourage the growth of Muslim communalism. For the latter, they introduced the system of separate electorates under which Muslims could only vote for Muslim candidates in constituencies specially reserved for them.\n\nThe Ghadar Movement (1914)\n\nThe outbreak of the First World War in 1914 gave impetus to the nationalist feelings of Indians. The Home Rule League by Lokmanya Tilak and Annie Besant were formed during First World War.\n\nAt the same time, a revolutionary movement gained popularity \u2013 The Ghadar Movement. (Note: The word Ghadar means \u2018revolt\u2019)\n\nThe Ghadar Movement was an international political movement founded by expatriate Indians to overthrow British rule in India.\n\nThe early membership was composed mostly of Punjabi Indians who lived and worked on the West Coast of the United States and Canada. The movement later spread to India and Indian diasporic communities around the world.\n\nThe main leader initially was Bhagwan Singh, a Sikh priest who had worked in Hong Kong and the Malay States.\n\nLater Har Dayal took leadership and played a crucial role in the Ghadar movement. He issued a Yugantar Circular praising the attack on the Viceroy. He urged Indians in the USA not to fight against the US but use their freedom in the US to fight the British.\n\nThe Ghadar militants toured extensively, visiting mills and farms where most of the Punjabi immigrant labour worked. The Yugantar Ashram became the home and headquarters and refuge of these political workers.\n\nKomagatamaru Incident\nThe Komagata Maru incident involved the Japanese steamship Komagata Maru, on which a group of people from British India attempted to immigrate to Canada in April 1914. Most of the ship passengers were denied entry and forced to return to Calcutta (present-day Kolkata). There, the Indian Imperial Police attempted to arrest the group leaders. A riot ensued, and they were fired upon by the police, resulting in the deaths of 22 people.\nBritish Government passed orders that no passenger be allowed to disembark anywhere on the way \u2014 not even at the places from where they had joined the ship \u2014 but only at Calcutta.\nIt triggered off a wave of resentment and anger among the Indian community and became the occasion for anti-British mobilization.\nA number of Ghadar leaders, like Barkatullah and Tarak Nath Das, used the inflammatory passions surrounding the\u00a0Komagata Maru incident as a rallying point and successfully brought many disaffected Indians in North America into the party\u2019s fold.\nGhadar\u2019s weakness\nGhadar leaders completely underestimated the extent of preparation needed at every level \u2014 organizational, ideological, strategic, tactical, and financial \u2014 that was necessary before an armed revolt could be organized.\nAn almost non-existent organizational structure; the Ghadar Movement was sustained more by the enthusiasm of the militants than by their effective organization.\nThe movement failed to generate an effective and sustained leadership that was capable of integrating the various aspects of the movement. Har Dayal\u2019s ideas did not form a structured vision but remained a shifting amalgam of various theories that attracted him from time to time.\nLacking a mass base, despite the remarkable heroism of the individual revolutionaries who operated in small secret groups, the movement could not withstand suppression by the strong colonial state.\nThe Ghadar Movement came to an abrupt end with the arrest of Har Dayal.\nThe Home Rule Movement (1916-1918)\n\nThe Home Rule Movement under the leadership of Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak was an important political movement that set the stage for India\u2019s struggle for independence.\n\nAnnie Besant, who was a proponent of Free Thought, Radicalism, Fabianism and Theosophy, had come to India in 1893 to work for the Theosophical Society.\n\nIn 1914, she decided to enlarge the sphere of her activities. She started a movement for Home Rule on the lines of the Irish Home Rule League.\n\nShe realized that she needs the cooperation of both Moderates and Extremists. In the annual session of the Congress 1915, it was decided that the Extremists be allowed to rejoin the Congress along with the Moderates.\n\nTilak set up the Home Rule League in the Bombay Province.\n\nThe two leagues worked in different areas.\n\nTilak promoted the Home Rule campaign which linked the question of Swaraj with the demand for the formation of linguistic states and education in the vernacular medium.\n\nMembers of Gokhale\u2019s Servants of India Society, though not permitted to become members of the League, encouraged the demand for Home Rule by undertaking lecture tours and publishing pamphlets.\n\nDuring the Lucknow session of the Congress in December 1916, the famous Congress-League Pact was declared. Both Tilak and Annie Besant had played a role in bringing about this agreement between the Congress and the League, much against the wishes of many important leaders, including Madan Mohan Malaviya. This pact is popularly known as the Lucknow Pact where separate electorates for Muslims were accepted.\n\nThe turning point in the home rule movement came with the decision of the Government of Madras in 1917 to place Mrs Besant and her associates, B.P. Wadia and George Arundale, under arrest.\n\nMontague Declaration was introduced by the British government as a sign of a conciliatory effort. Henceforth, Home Rule or self-government movement was not treated as a seditious activity. However, this did not mean that the British were ready to grant self-government.\n\nIn 1920 All India Home Rule League changed its name to Swarajya Sabha.\n\nThe main achievement of the Home Rule Movement was that it created a generation of ardent nationalists who formed the backbone of the national movement. In the later years, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian freedom struggle entered its truly mass phase.\n\nChamparan movement in Bihar (1917)\n\nMahatma Gandhi, after his struggle against apartheid in South Africa (racial discrimination against blacks) for almost twenty years, returned to India in 1915.\u00a0 On Gokhale\u2019s advice, he spent a year travelling around British India to understand the problems of Indians.\n\nHe initially maintained a distance from political affairs, including the Home Rule Movement that was gathering momentum at this time.\n\nMahatma Gandhi began his experiments with Satyagraha against the oppressive European indigo planters at Champaran in Bihar in 1917.\n\nChamparan issue had actually begun in the early 19th century when European planters made agreements with Indian farmers that forced them to cultivate indigo on the 3/20th of their holdings (known as the Tinkathia system).\n\nResistance kept surfacing within planters and cultivators, because of the exploitation measures adopted by the British behind the indigo cultivation.\n\nIn 1908 Raj Kumar Shukla, a local man persuaded Gandhiji to come to Champaran to investigate the problem. Gandhi reached Champaran but faced resistance from the Commissioner who ordered him to immediately leave the district. Gandhiji refused. He preferred to take the punishment for his defiance of the law. This step was unusual because even Home Rule leaders used to obey the Government.\n\nThe British Indian government didn\u2019t want to create a controversy and ordered the local Government to retreat. They allowed Gandhiji to proceed with his enquiry and even nominated him as one of the enquiry members of the Government.\n\nMeanwhile, Gandhiji started investigating the grievances of peasants along with Brij Kishore, Rajendra Prasad and other members of the Bihar intelligentsia. J.B. Kripalani toured the villages and recorded the statements of peasants.\n\nGandhiji had little difficulty in convincing the Commission that the Tinkathia system needed to be abolished and that the peasants should be compensated for the illegal enhancement of their dues. The Commission founder planters guilty of exploitation.\n\nThe commission of enquiry decided to make refunds to the peasants. Gandhi asked for 50%. But the representative of planters offered to refund to the extent of 25%. In order to break the deadlock, Gandhiji agreed to a 25 per cent refund to the farmers. For Gandhi, it was not the money but the principles that were of utmost importance. In his belief, the submission of British landlords was more significant than the percentage of refunds.\n\nAhmedabad Satyagraha in Gujarat (1918)\n\nIn Ahmedabad, a dispute was brewing between workers and mill owners over the question of a \u2018plague bonus\u2019.\n\nThe employers wanted to withdraw the bonus once the epidemic had passed but the workers insisted it stay.\n\nThe British Collector asked Gandhiji to work out a compromise. Gandhiji persuaded the mill owners and the workers to agree to arbitration.\n\nThe workers demanded a 50% wage hike while the mill owners\u00a0offered only a twenty per cent wage hike. They threatened to dismiss all workers who did not accept it.\n\nGandhiji advised the workers to go on strike. He himself started fasting for workers.\n\nGandhiji was peculiar in that workers should get at least a thirty-five per cent increase in wages.\n\nFinally, the strike was withdrawn after mill owners agreed to a thirty-five per cent increase the workers had demanded.\n\nAnasuya Behn was one of the main lieutenants of Gandhiji in this struggle.\n\nKheda Satyagraha in Gujarat (1918)\n\nThe Kheda district of Gujarat was on the verge of famine owing to the failure of the crops.\n\nThe yield had been so low that the cultivators were unable to pay the revenue. But the government insisted that the cultivators should pay the tax.\n\nGandhi saw the justice of the cause of the cultivators. Enquiries by members of the Servants of India Society and Vithalbhai Patel too confirmed the genuineness of the peasants\u2019 case.\n\nGandhiji advised the withholding of tax payments, and asked the peasants to \u2018fight unto death against such a spirit of vindictiveness and tyranny\u2019.\n\nThe peasants of Kheda, already deprived because of plague, high prices and drought, were showing signs of weakness when Gandhiji came to know that the Government had issued secret instructions directing that revenue should be recovered only from those peasants who could pay.\n\nThe Government said that if well-to-do cultivators paid up the poorer section would be granted suspension. This was agreed to and the campaign ended.\n\nThe Kheda Satyagraha marked the beginning of an awakening among the peasants of Gujarat, the beginning of their true political education. In addition, it gave the educated public workers the chance to establish contact with the actual life of the peasants.\n\nRowlatt Satyagraha (1919)\n\nDuring the First World War of 1914-18, the British instituted censorship of the press and permitted detention without trial.\n\nThe Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919, popularly known as the Rowlatt Act, was passed by the Imperial Legislative Council in Delhi on 18 March 1919, indefinitely extending the emergency measures of preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without trial and judicial review enacted in the Defence of India Act 1915 during the First World War.\n\nIt was enacted in light of a perceived threat from revolutionary nationalists to organisations of re-engaging in similar conspiracies as during the war which the Government felt the lapse of the Defence of India Act would enable.\n\nThis act was passed on the recommendations of the Sedition Committee chaired by Sir Sidney Rowlatt.\n\nGandhiji launched Satyagraha against the inhuman Rowlatt Act.\n\nThe protests were particularly intense in the Punjab Gandhiji was detained while proceeding there.\n\nJallianwala Bagh massacre (1919)\n\nThe passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 resulted in large-scale political unrest throughout India.\n\nA large peaceful crowd had gathered at the\u00a0Jallianwala Bagh\u00a0in\u00a0Amritsar,\u00a0Punjab\u00a0to\u00a0protest\u00a0against the\u00a0arrest\u00a0of pro-Indian independence leaders\u00a0Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew\u00a0and\u00a0Dr. Satya Pal.\n\nIn response to the public gathering, the British\u00a0Brigadier-General\u00a0R.\u00a0E.\u00a0H. Dyer\u00a0surrounded the Bagh with his soldiers.\n\nGeneral Dyer ordered his troops to open fire on the nationalist meeting killing hundreds. The brutality at Jallianwala Bagh stunned the entire nation.\n\nThis event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their previous loyalty to the British and become nationalists distrustful of British rule.\n\nNon-cooperation Movement (1920)\n\nGandhiji called for a campaign of \u201cnon-cooperation\u201d with British rule. Indians who wished colonialism to end were asked to stop attending schools, colleges, and law courts. They were asked to not pay taxes. In sum, they were asked to adhere to a \u201crenunciation of all voluntary association with the British Government\u201d.\n\nGandhiji said that if non-cooperation was effectively carried out India would win swaraj within a year.\n\nWhen Congress met for its annual session at Nagpur, C.R. Das moved the main resolution on non-cooperation. Many groups of revolutionary terrorists, especially in Bengal, also pledged support to the movement.\n\nThe goal of the Congress, by this time, changed from the attainment of self-government by constitutional means to the attainment of Swaraj by peaceful means.\n\nKhilafat Movement (1919-24)\n\nThe Khilafat movement was a political protest campaign launched by Muslims of British India to restore the caliph of the Ottoman Caliphate, who was considered the leader of the Muslims.\n\nTo further broaden the Indian freedom struggle, Gandhiji joined hands with the Khilafat Movement.\n\nThe movement collapsed by late 1922 when Turkey gained a more favourable diplomatic position and moved towards Nationalism. By 1924, Turkey abolished the role of the caliph.\n\nHowever, the tremendous participation of Muslims in the Non-Cooperation Movement and the maintenance of communal unity, despite the Malabar developments, was in itself no mean achievement.\n\nChauri Chaura incident (1922)\n\nOn 4 February 1922, at Chauri Chaura (a place in modern Uttar Pradesh), the British police opened fire at a large group of people who were participating in the Non-cooperation movement.\n\nIn retaliation, the demonstrators attacked and set fire to a police station, killing all of its occupants. The incident led to the death of three civilians and 22 policemen.\n\nMahatma Gandhi, who was strictly against violence, halted the non-cooperation movement on the national level on 12 February 1922, as a direct result of the Chauri Chaura incident.\n\nIn spite of Gandhi\u2019s decision, 19 arrested demonstrators were sentenced to death and 14 to imprisonment for life by the British colonial authorities.\n\nMotilal Nehru, C.R. Das, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Bose, and many others recorded their disagreement on Gandhiji\u2019s views.\n\nBardoli Satyagraha in Gujarat (1928)\n\nIn January 1926, the officer charged with the duty of reassessment of the land revenue demand of the taluq had recommended a 30% increase over the existing assessment.\n\nThe Congress leaders were quick to protest against the increase and set up the Bardoli Inquiry Committee to go into the issue.\n\nIn July 1927, the Government reduced the enhancement to 21.97 per cent. But the concessions were too meagre and came too late to satisfy anybody.\n\nThe constitutionalist leaders now began to advise the peasants to resist by paying only the current amount and withholding the enhanced amount.\n\nGradually as the limitations of constitutional leadership became more apparent, Vallabhbhai Patel was invited to lead the campaign.\n\nThe government ignored Vallabhai\u2019s request which resulted in the start of Bardoli Satyagraha.\n\nThe no-tax movement was launched in Bardoli taluq of Surat district in Gujarat in 1928.\n\nThe main mobilization was done through extensive propaganda via meetings, speeches, pamphlets, and door-to-door persuasion. Special emphasis was placed on the mobilization of women and many women activists were recruited for the purpose.\n\nMembers of the Bombay Legislative Council like K.M. Munshi and Lalji Naranji, the representatives of the Indian Merchants Chamber, resigned their seats.\n\nThe government was forced to conduct an inquiry. The inquiry was done by a judicial officer, Broomfield, and a revenue officer, Maxwell. They came to the conclusion that the increase had been unjustified. The government later reduced the enhancement to 6.03 per cent.\n\nThe boycott of the Simon Commission (1927)\n\nOn 8 November 1927, an all-white, Simon Commission was appointed to recommend whether India was ready for further constitutional reforms.\n\nIndian National Congress boycott Simon Commission because no Indian was present in the commission. There were protests in many places.\n\nIn Lahore, Lala Lajpat Rai, the hero of the extremist days and the most revered leader of Punjab was hit. He succumbed to the injuries in November 1928.\n\nBhagat Singh and his comrades sought to avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai. They killed the white police official, Saunders, in December 1928.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Bose emerged as the leaders during the Simon Commission boycott movement.\n\nNehru Report (1928) and the attempt to draft the Indian Constitution\n\nBritain did not acknowledge the right of Indians to frame their own constitution.\n\nBritish policy, until almost the end of the Raj, was that the timing and nature of Indian constitutional development were to be decided exclusively by the British Parliament, but it was assumed that Indians would be consulted as appropriate.\n\nIn December 1927, at its Madras session, the Indian National Congress took two major decisions in response to the setting up the Simon Commission: first, it decided to not cooperate with the Commission; second, it set up an All Parties Conference to draft a Constitution for India.\n\nThe committee of the All Parties Conference to draft the Constitution was chaired by Motilal Nehru\u00a0with his son\u00a0Jawaharlal Nehru acting as a secretary. There were nine other members in this committee.\n\nThe report submitted by the committee in 1928 was called the Nehru Report \u2013 which was actually a memorandum to appeal for dominion status and a federal set-up of government for the constitution of India.\n\nThe Nehru Report also rejected the principle of separate communal electorates on which previous constitutional reforms had been based. Seats would be reserved for Muslims at the Centre and in provinces in which they were in a minority, but not in those where they had a numerical majority.\n\nThe Nehru Report also recommended universal adult suffrage, equal rights for women, freedom to form unions, and dissociation of the state from religion in any form.\n\nHowever, Jinnah withdrew his support to the report and proposed his \u2018Fourteen Points\u2019 which were basically a reiteration of his objections to the Nehru Report.\n\nYoung and radical nationalists led by Jawaharlal Nehru had objections to the Nehru Report of Motilal Nehru. Their slogan was \u2018Complete Independence.\u2019\n\nPurna Swaraj or Complete Independence Campaign (1929)\n\nIn the Lahore session in 1929, Jawaharlal Nehru was made the President of INC. He declared \u2018Purna Swaraj\u2019 or Complete Independence as the only honourable goal Indians could strive for.\n\nOn the banks of the river Ravi, at midnight on 31 December 1929, the tricolour flag of Indian independence was hosted.\n\nThe first task that the Congress set itself in the new year was that of organizing all over the country public meetings at which the Independence Pledge would be read out and collectively affirmed on 26 January.\n\nCivil Disobedience Movement and Dandi March (1930)\n\nThe Lahore Session of Congress (1929) authorized the Working Committee to launch a programme of civil disobedience including non-payment of taxes.\n\nGandhi\u2019s ultimatum to Lord Irwin, stating the minimum demands in the form of 11 points, had been ignored, and there was now only one way out: civil disobedience. Gandhi selected salt as his main tool of disobedience.\n\nIn every Indian household, salt was indispensable; yet people were forbidden from making salt even for domestic use, compelling them to buy it from shops at a high price. The state monopoly over salt was deeply unpopular. By making salt his target, Gandhiji hoped to mobilise a wider discontent against British rule.\n\nGandhi, along with a band of seventy-eight members of the Sabarmati Ashram started to march from Ahmedabad to the coast at Dandi. There he broke the salt laws by collecting salt from the beach.\n\nOn 6 April 1930, by picking up a handful of salt, Gandhi inaugurated the Civil Disobedience Movement \u2013 a movement that was to remain unsurpassed in the history of the Indian national movement for the country-wide mass participation it unleashed.\n\nLike other parts of India, the civil disobedience movement was also launched in North-West Frontier Province (Khyber\u2013Pakhtoonkhwa). The local Congress sought help from the Khudai Khidmatgars, the most popular socio-political organization in the province.\n\nKhan Abdul Gaffar Khan\u2019s Khudai Khidmatgars, popularly known as the Red Shirts,\u00a0 played an extremely active role in the Civil Disobedience Movement.\n\nThe city came under the control of the masses for at least a week and the soldiers of the Garhwali regiment refused to fire at the unarmed crowds of Peshwar demonstrations.\n\nNehru\u2019s arrest on 14th April was followed by public protests in Madras, Calcutta and Karachi.\n\nThe Salt March was notable for at least three reasons:\n\nIt was this event that first brought Mahatma Gandhi to world attention.\nIt was the first nationalist activity in which women participated in large numbers. Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay had persuaded Gandhi for this issue.\nIt was the Salt March that forced upon the British the realisation that their Raj would not last forever, and that they would have to devolve some power to the Indians.\nGandhi-Irwin Pact (1931) and the Round Table Conferences (1930-32)\n\nBritish convened a series of \u201cRound Table Conferences\u201d in London to discuss constitutional reforms in India.\n\nThe first meeting was held in November 1930. However, without the pre-eminent political leader in India, it was an exercise in futility.\n\nGandhi was released from jail in January 1931. In the following month, he had several long meetings with the Viceroy. These culminated in what was called the \u201cGandhi-Irwin Pact\u2019.\n\nThe terms of the agreement included the immediate release of all political prisoners not convicted for violence, the remission of all fines not yet collected, the return of confiscated lands not yet sold to third parties, and lenient treatment for those government employees who had resigned. The Government also conceded the right to make salt for consumption to villages along the coast. They also gave the right to peaceful and non-aggressive picketing.\n\nThe Congress\u2019s demand for a public inquiry into police excesses was not accepted, but Gandhiji\u2019s insistent request for an inquiry was recorded in the agreement.\n\nCongress, on its part, agreed to discontinue the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM).\n\nA second Round Table Conference was held in London in the latter part of 1931. Here, Gandhiji represented the Congress. Gandhi opposed the demand for separate electorates for \u201clower castes\u201d. For him, separate electorates to the \u201cUntouchables\u201d will ensure their bondage in perpetuity. He thought this would prevent their integration into mainstream society and permanently segregate them from other caste Hindus.\n\nBut Ambedkar was in favour of separate electorates for depressed classes. He believed it is the only path for a community so handicapped to succeed in the struggle for life against the organised tyranny of higher castes.\n\nDuring the second Round Table Conference in London, Winston Churchill, leader of the right wing, strongly objected to the British Government negotiating on terms of equality with the \u2018seditious fakir\u2019. He demanded a strong government in India.\n\nThe discussions with Gandhi failed as the British Government refused to concede the basic Indian demand for freedom. Gandhiji resumed Civil Disobedience after reaching back\n\nThe government launched its strike against the national movement by arresting Gandhi. British government promulgated ordinances that gave the authorities unlimited power \u2013 the \u2018Civil Martial Law.\u2019 Civil liberties no longer existed and the authorities could seize people and property at will.\n\nIn 1934 the inevitable decision to withdraw Civil Disobedience Movement was taken by Gandhi.\n\nHowever, many political activists were not in favour of stopping the movement. They included Jawaharlal Nehru who was critical of Gandhiji\u2019s decisions regarding the timing of the withdrawal of CDM.\n\nThe support that the movement had garnered from the poor and the illiterate, both in the town and in the country, was remarkable indeed.\n\nNevertheless, the participation of Muslims in the Civil Disobedience Movement was certainly nowhere near that of the Non-cooperation movement 1920-22.\n\nFor Indian women, the movement was the most liberating experience to date and can truly be said to have marked their entry into the public space.\n\nThe Communal Award (1932)\n\nAfter the Third Round Table Conference, in November 1932, the then Prime Minister of Britain Ramsay McDonald gave an order which is known as the Communal Award.\n\nIt was part of Britain\u2019s policy of \u2018Divide and Rule.\n\nThe award granted separate electorates in British India for the Forward Caste, Lower Caste, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, Europeans and Untouchables (Dalits) etc.\n\nThe Congress Party was unhappy at the extension of communal representation but became particularly outraged at the British offer of separate-electorate seats for \u201cdepressed classes\u201d.\n\nGandhi viewed the McDonald Award as a nefarious\u00a0British plot to wean more than 50 million Hindus away from their higher-caste brothers and sisters.\n\nThe idea of a separate electorate for Muslims had been accepted by Congress as far back as 1916 as a part of the compromise with the Muslim League. Hence, Congress took the position it was opposed to separate electorates but not in favour of changing the Award without the consent of the minorities.\n\nGandhi demanded that the representatives of the Depressed Classes should be elected if possible by the universal, common franchise. At the same time, he did not object to the demand for a larger number of reserved seats for the Depressed Classes. He went on a fast unto death on 20 September 1932 to enforce his demand.\n\nIn the end, political leaders succeeded in bringing an agreement, known as the Poona Pact.\n\nIn this pact, the idea of separate electorates for the Depressed Classes was abandoned but the seats reserved for them in the provincial legislatures and Central Legislature were increased.\n\nAfter being released from prison Gandhiji shifted to Satyagraha Ashram at Wardha after abandoning Sabarmati Ashram at Ahmedabad for he had vowed in 1930 not to return to Sabarmati till Swaraj was won.\n\nGovernment of India Act (1935)\n\nThe growing demand for constitutional reforms in India led the British Parliament to enact the Government of India Act 1935.\n\nThe Act promised some form of representative government.\n\nThe Act provided the establishment of an All-India Federation based on the union of British Indian provinces and the Princely States.\n\nDefence and foreign affairs would remain outside the control of the federal legislature, while the Viceroy would retain special control over other subjects.\n\nGovernors, appointed by the British Government, retained special powers. They could veto legislative and administrative measures, especially those concerning minorities, the rights of civil servants, law and order, and British business interests.\n\nThe Governor also had the power to take over and indefinitely run the administration of a province.\n\nThe Act of 1935 was condemned and unanimously rejected by Congress. The Congress demanded the convening of a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise to frame a constitution for an independent India.\n\nResignation of Congress ministries (1939)\n\nCongress won the elections to the provincial assemblies held in February 1937. Its election manifesto reaffirmed its total rejection of the 1935 Act.\n\nOne of the first acts of the Congress Government was to release thousands of political prisoners and to cancel deportation orders on political workers.\n\nThe difference between the Congress provinces and the non-Congress provinces of Bengal and Punjab was most apparent in this realm. In the latter, especially in Bengal, civil liberties continued to be curbed and they never released prisoners.\n\nHowever, Congress could not attempt a complete overhaul of the agrarian structure by completely eliminating the Zamindari system.\n\nLater the Second World War broke out. Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru promised Congress support to the war effort if the British, in return, promised to grant India independence once hostilities ended. The offer was refused. Gandhi withdrew support to the British in War.\n\nThe Congress ministries resigned in October and November 1939, in protest against Viceroy Lord Linlithgow\u2019s action of declaring India to be belligerent in the Second World War without consulting the Indian people.\n\nThe resignations brought the Left and the Right in Congress closer because of a common policy on the question of participation in the war.\n\nCrisis at Tripuri (1939)\n\nSubhas Bose had been a unanimous choice as the President of Congress in 1938. In 1939, he decided to stand again \u2014 this time as the spokesperson of militant politics and radical groups.\n\nHowever, with the blessings of Gandhiji, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad, J.B. Kripalani other leaders put up Pattabhi Sitaramayya as a candidate for the post.\n\nBose accused Patel and other top leaders of Congress as \u2018rightists\u2019. He openly accused them of working for a compromise with the Government on the question of the federation. Bose had, therefore, appealed to Congressmen to vote for a leftist and \u2018a genuine anti-federationist.\u2019\n\nNevertheless, in reality, the difference between \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018left\u2019 was not very vivid within the Congress and most Congressmen were anti-federationist.\n\nSubhas Bose won the election on 29 January on the popularity of his militant politics but only by a narrow margin \u2013 1580 votes against 1377.\n\nBut the election of Bose brought the brewing crisis to a head at the Tripuri session of the Congress.\n\nGandhiji declared that Sitaramayya\u2019s defeat was \u2018more mine than his.\n\nBose argued in his presidential address at Tripuri for a programme of immediately giving the British Government a six-month ultimatum to grant the national demand for independence and of launch a mass civil disobedience movement if it failed to do so.\n\nSubhas Bose believed that the Congress was strong enough to bunch an immediate struggle and that the masses were ready for such a struggle.\n\nHowever, Gandhi\u2019s perceptions were very different. Gandhi believed the time was not yet ripe for an ultimatum because neither Congress nor the masses were yet ready for struggle.\n\nThe internal strife reached its climax at the Tripuri session of the Congress, held from 8 to 12 March 1939.\n\nBose had completely misjudged his support and the meaning of his majority in the presidential election. Congressmen had voted for him not because they wanted to have him as the supreme leader of the national movement \u2013 but mainly because of his policies and militant politics. They were not willing to reject Gandhi\u2019s leadership or his views.\n\nBose resigned from the presidency. This led to the election of Rajendra Prasad in his place.\n\nSubsequently, Subhas Bose and his followers formed the Forward Bloc as a new party within Congress.\n\nAs Bose planned a protest against an AICC resolution, the Working Committee removed Bose from the presidentship of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee and debarred him from holding any Congress office for three years.\n\nIndividual Satyagraha (1940)\n\nGandhiji decided to initiate a limited satyagraha on an individual basis by a few selected individuals in every locality. The demand of a satyagrahi was for the freedom of speech to preach against participation in the War.\n\nThe satyagrahi would beforehand inform the district magistrate of the time and place where he or she was going to make the anti-war speech. If the Government did not arrest a satyagrahi, he or she would not only repeat the performance but move into the villages and start a trek towards Delhi, thus participating in a movement that came to be known as the \u2018Delhi Chalo\u2019 (onwards to Delhi) movement.\n\nVinoba Bhave was to be the first satyagrahi on 17 October 1940 and Jawaharlal Nehru the second.\n\nIndividual Satyagraha served a dual purpose \u2014 (1) it gave expression to the Indian people\u2019s strong political feelings, (2) it gave the British Government another opportunity to peacefully accept the Indian demands.\n\nCripps Mission (1942)\n\nThe Cripps Mission was a failed attempt in late March 1942 by the British government to secure full Indian cooperation and support for their efforts in World War II.\n\nThe mission was headed by a senior minister Sir Stafford Cripps, traditionally sympathetic to Indian self-rule.\n\nHowever, he was also a member of the coalition War Cabinet led by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who had long been the leader of the movement to block Indian independence.\n\nChurchill was persuaded to send Sir Stafford Cripps, to India to try and forge a compromise with Gandhiji and the Congress.\n\nThe Declaration promised India Dominion Status and a constitution-making body after the War. He proposed that the Constitutional Assembly members would be elected by the provincial assemblies and nominated by the rulers in the case of the princely states.\n\nAt that time, the demand for a separate nation for Muslims \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 also got momentum.\n\nThe Pakistan demand was accommodated by the provision that any province which was not prepared to accept the new constitution would have the right to sign a separate agreement with Britain regarding its future status.\n\nTalks broke down, when, Congress objected to the provision for Dominion Status rather than full independence.\n\nCongress insisted that if it was to help the British defend India from the Axis powers, then the Viceroy had first to appoint an Indian as the Defence Member of his Executive Council.\n\nAfter the failure of the Cripps Mission, Mahatma Gandhi decided to launch the \u201cQuit India\u201d campaign also known as the \u2018August Revolution\u2019.\n\nQuit India Movement (1942)\n\nThe\u00a0Quit India Movement was\u00a0launched at the Bombay session of the\u00a0All India Congress Committee\u00a0by\u00a0Mahatma Gandhi\u00a0on 8 August 1942, during\u00a0World War II, demanding an end to\u00a0British rule in India.\n\nIn this struggle, the common people of the country demonstrated unparalleled heroism and militancy.\n\nHowever, the repression that they faced was the most brutal that had ever been used against the national movement.\n\nAt the historic August meeting at Gowalia Tank in Bombay, Gandhiji was particular about complete freedom and no more piece-meal approach from the British.\n\nHe proclaimed: \u2018Do or Die\u2019 \u2013 which meant either free India or die in the attempt.\n\nGandhi asked government servants to openly declare their allegiance to congress\u00a0and not to resign.\n\nIn the meantime, underground networks were consolidated in various parts of the country. The prominent members of underground activities were Achyut Patwardhan, Aruna Asaf Ali, Ram Manohar Lohia, and Sucheta Kripalani.\n\nThe pattern of activity of the underground movement was that of organizing the disruption of communications by blowing up bridges, cutting telegraph and telephone wires, and derailing trains.\n\nCongress Radio operated clandestinely from different locations in Bombay city, whose broadcast could be heard as far as Madras. Usha Mehta was an important member of the small group that ran the Congress Radio.\n\nA significant feature of the Quit India Movement was the emergence of what came to be known as parallel governments in some parts of the country. Satara (Maharashtra) emerged as the base of the longest-lasting and most effective parallel government.\n\nA significant feature of peasant activity was its total concentration on attacking symbols of British authority and a total lack of any incidents of anti-zamindar violence.\n\nIn February 1943, Gandhiji declared the fast in Aga Khan Palace where he was held in detention, as this was his answer to the Government which had been constantly exhorting him to condemn the violence of the people in the Quit India Movement. Gandhiji not only refused to condemn the people\u2019s resort to violence but unequivocally held the Government responsible for it.\n\nThe resignation of the three Indian members of the Viceroy\u2019s Executive Council, M.S. Aney, N.R. Sarkar and H.P. Mody, who never wished Gandhi to suffer, made a severe blow to the British.\n\nFinally, the Congress leaders were released to participate in the Simla Conference in June 1945. That marked the end of the phase of confrontation that had existed since August 1942.\n\nSimla Conference (1945) and the Wavell Plan\n\nThe Simla Conference of 1945 was a meeting between the Viceroy of India (Lord Wavell) and the major political leaders of British India at the Viceregal Lodge in Simla.\n\nWavell proposed a separate representation of Muslims within a united India. Talks, however, stalled on the issue of the selection of Muslim representatives. The All-India Muslim League claimed to be the sole representative of Indian Muslims. The Indian National Congress opposed this claim as the Congress had more Muslims in its support than the Muslim League.\n\nThis scuttled the conference, and perhaps the last viable opportunity for a united, independent India.\n\nOn 14 June 1945 Lord Wavell announced a plan for a new Executive Council in which all members except the Viceroy and the Commander in Chief would be Indians. This executive council was to be a temporary measure until a new permanent constitution could be agreed upon and come into force.\n\nRIN Mutiny (1946)\n\nThe Royal Indian Navy (RIN) revolt started in February 1946 at Mumbai when the naval ratings on HMIS Talwar protested against the poor quality of food and racial discrimination by British officers.\n\nFrom the initial flashpoint in Mumbai, the revolt spread and found support throughout\u00a0India, from\u00a0Karachi\u00a0to\u00a0Kolkata, and ultimately came to involve over 20,000 sailors in 78 ships and shore establishments.\n\nKarachi was a major centre, second only to Bombay. Sympathetic strikes took place in military establishments in Madras, Vishakhapatnam, Calcutta, Delhi, Cochin, Jamnagar, the Andamans, Bahrain and Aden.\n\nA revolt in the armed forces, even if soon suppressed, had a great liberating effect on the minds of people.\n\nThe naval mutiny proved to be the last nail in the coffin of British colonial aspirations in India.\n\nIndia was seen to be on the brink of a revolution. The mutiny witnessed the demoralization of British officials and the changing loyalties of Indian officials.\n\nHowever, communal unity evident in the RIN revolt was limited despite the Congress, League and Communist flags being jointly hoisted on the ships\u2019 masts. Muslim ratings went to the League to seek advice on future action for Pakistan.\n\nThe\u00a0Indian National Congress\u00a0and the\u00a0Muslim League\u00a0condemned the mutiny, while the\u00a0Communist Party of India\u00a0was the only party that supported the rebellion.\n\nThe mutiny was suppressed by British troops and Royal Navy warships.\n\nThe revolt was called off following a meeting between the President of the Naval Central Strike Committee (NCSC), M. S. Khan, and Sardar Vallabhai Patel who had been sent to Bombay to settle the crisis.\n\nMountbatten Plan (1947)\n\nThe legislature representatives of the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, and the Sikh community came to an agreement with Lord Mountbatten on what has come to be known as the 3 June Plan or Mountbatten Plan. This plan was the last plan for independence.\n\nThe plan announced by the Viceroy Mountbatten on 3 June 1947 included these principles:\n\nThe principle of the partition of British India was accepted by the British Government.\nSuccessor governments would be given\u00a0dominion status.\nAutonomy and sovereignty to both countries.\nThe successor governments could make their own constitution\nThe Princely States were given the right to join either Pakistan or India, based on two major factors: Geographical contiguity and the people\u2019s wishes.\n\nThe Mountbatten plan led to the enactment of the India Independence Act of 1947.\n\nIndia Independence Act (1947)\n\nThe Indian Independence Act of 1947 passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom divided British India into two new independent dominions; the Dominion of India (later to become the\u00a0Republic of India) and the\u00a0Dominion of Pakistan\u00a0(later to become the\u00a0Islamic Republic of Pakistan).\n\nThis Act received Royal Assent on 18 July 1947.\n\nIndia and Pakistan became independent on August 15th, 1947.\n\nIndia continues to celebrate August 15th as her Independence day, while Pakistan chose to celebrate August 14th as her Independence day as per their cabinet decisions.\n\nLearn more about India\u2019s Struggle for Independence\n\nHope you liked the mega article on the Indian freedom struggle.\n\nThis article on India\u2019s struggle for independence is the 6th part of the article series on Modern Indian History.

Read to know more about the various social and religious movements which transformed Indian society in the nineteenth and twentieth century.\n\nIn the\u00a06-part framework to study modern Indian History, we have so far covered:\n\nIndia in 1750.\nBritish Expansion.\nThe changes introduced by the British.\nPopular Uprisings and Revolts against the British\n\nIn this article (5th part), we discuss the socio-religious movements in British India.\n\nThe changes brought by the British like modern education resulted in many social and religious reform movements in India.\n\nThe 1800s and 1900s saw more and more people appreciating the values of Indian culture, but they were also vocal enough to reject the bad elements in it. Many leaders emerged to reform Indian society. They mostly aspired to revive the Indian society with modern values.\n\nKeshub Chandra Sen, for example, said: \u201cWhat we see around us today is a fallen nation \u2013 a nation whose primitive greatness lies buried in ruins\u201d.\n\nSwami Vivekananda described the condition of the Indians then, in the following words: \u201cMoving about here and there emaciated figures of young and old in tattered rags, whose faces bear deep-cut lines of the despair and poverty of hundreds of years; cows, bullocks, buffaloes common everywhere \u2013 aye, the same melancholy look in their eyes, the same feeble physique, on the wayside, refuse and dirt; \u2013 this is our present-day India.\u201d\n\nFilled with the desire to adapt their society to the requirements of the modem world of science, democracy and nationalism, social leaders then set out to reform their traditional religions. This was because religion in those times was a basic part of people\u2019s life and there could be little social reform without religious reform.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which year are YOU targeting for success in the IAS/IPS/IFS Exam? \ud83d\ude80\n\n(1) \u21d2 UPSC 2025: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(2) \u21d2 UPSC 2026: Prelims cum Mains\n\n(3) \u21d2 UPSC 2027 Prelims cum Mains\n\nTip: Know more about ClearIAS Courses (Online/Offline)\n\nAlso read: Basavanna: Renowned Social Reformer\n\nTable of Contents\n\nClassification of Social and Religious Movements which reformed India\nThe Hindu Reform Movements\nHindu Reform Movements in Eastern India (Bengal)\n(1) Brahmo Samaj by Raja Ramohun Roy\n(2) Tattvabodhini Sabha and Adi Brahmo Samaj by Debendranath Tagore\n(3) Brahmo Samaj of India by Keshab Chandra Sen\n(4) Young Bengal Movement by Henry Derozio\n(5) Ramakrishna Movement by Swami Vivekananda\nHindu Reform Movements in Western India (Maharashtra)\n(1) Prarthana Samaj by Dadoba Pandurang and Atmaram Pandurang\n(2) Arya Samaj by Swami Dayanand Dayanand Saraswati\nHindu Reform Movements in South India (Maharashtra)\nThe Theosophical Society by Madam H.P.

They actively opposed the caste system and child marriage and supported the general uplift of women, including widow remarriage, and the spread of modem education to men and women.\nThe Brahmo tradition of Raja Rammohun Roy was carried forward after 1843 by Devendranath Tagore and after 1866 by Keshub Chandra Sen.\n(2) TATTVABODHINI SABHA AND ADI BRAHMO SAMAJ BY DEBENDRANATH TAGORE\nDebendranath Tagore, father of Rabindranath Tagore formed Tattvabodhini Sabha in 1839.\nHe later gave a new life to Brahmo Samaj when he joined it in 1842.\nHe devoted himself to the systematic study of India\u2019s past with a rational outlook.\nHe propagated Roy\u2019s ideas.\n(3) BRAHMO SAMAJ OF INDIA BY KESHAB CHANDRA SEN\nKeshab Chandra Sen joined Brahmo Samaj in 1858 and was made acharya by Debendranath Tagore.\nHe was instrumental in popularising Brahmo Samaj outside Bengal in the United Provinces, Punjab, Bombay and Madras.\nIn 1863, Keshab was instrumental in the formation of Prarthana Samaj in Bombay which relied on education and persuasion and not on direct confrontation with Hindu Orthodoxy.\nKeshab Sen was a strong believer in religious universalism. He often stated that \u201cOur position is not that truths are to be found in all religious, but that all established religions of the world are true\u201d.\nHis radicalism brought him into opposition with Debendranath. In 1866, the Samaj was formally divided into Adi Brahmo Samaj (headed by Debendranath Tagore) and the Brahmo Samaj of India (headed by Keshab Chandra Sen)\nIn 1873 due to the inexplicable act of getting his own 13-year-old daughter married by following all Orthodox Hindurituals, Brahmo Samaj of India was again split.\n(4) YOUNG BENGAL MOVEMENT BY HENRY DEROZIO\nHenry taught at Hindu College from 1826-31.\nInspired by French Revolution, he taught his pupils to think freely, rationally and question all authority.\n(5) RAMAKRISHNA MOVEMENT BY SWAMI VIVEKANANDA\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa (1834-86) was a saintly person who sought religious salvation in the traditional ways of renunciation, meditation and devotion (bhakti).\nHe emphasised that there were many roads to God and salvation and that service of man was service of God, for man was the embodiment of God.\nSwami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was his disciple.\nVivekanda popularised Ramakrishna\u2019s religious messages. He tried to put it in a form that would suit the needs of contemporary Indian society.\nVivekanda wrote in 1898; \u201cFor our own motherland a junction of the two great systems, Hinduism and Islam\u2026 is the only hope\u201d.\nAt the same time, he was convinced of the superior approach of the Indian philosophical tradition. He himself subscribed to Vedanta which he declared to be a fully rational system.\nVivekananda criticised Indians for having lost touch with the rest of the world and became stagnant and mummified.\nVivekananda condemned the caste system and the Hindu emphasis on rituals and superstitions.\nHe urged people to imbibe the spirit of liberty, equality and free-thinking.\nVivekananda was a great humanist. Shocked by the poverty, misery and suffering of the common people of the country, he wrote: \u201cThe only God in whom I believe, the sum total of all souls, and above all, my God the wicked, my God the afflicted, my God the poor of all races\u201d\nTo the educated Indians, he said: So long as the millions live in hunger and ignorance, I hold every man a traitor, who having been educated at their expense, pays not the least heed to them\u201d\nIn 1897, Vivekananda founded Ramakrishna Mission to carry on humanitarian relief and social work. It thus laid emphasis on social good or social service.\nHindu Reform Movements in Western India (Maharashtra)\n\nReligious reforms started in Bombay in 1840 by the Parmahans Mandali which aimed at fighting idolatry and the caste system. Perhaps the earliest religious reformer in western India was Gopal Hari Deshmukh, known popularly as \u2018Lokahitwadi\u2019, who wrote in Marathi. He made powerful rationalist attacks on Hindu orthodoxy and preached religious and social equality.\n\n(1) PRARTHANA SAMAJ BY DADOBA PANDURANG AND ATMARAM PANDURANG\n\nPrarthana Samaj or \u201cPrayer Society\u201d in Sanskrit, was a movement for religious and social reform in Bombay, India, based on earlier reform movements.\n\nPrarthana Samaj was founded by the Dadoba Pandurang and his brother Atmaram Pandurang in 1863 when Keshub Chandra Sen visited Maharashtra, with an aim to make people believe in one God and worship only one God.\n\nIt became popular after Mahadev Govind Ranade joined. Two of its great leaders were G Bhandarkar, the famous Sanskrit scholar and historian, and Mahadev Govind Ranade (1842-1901).\n\nThe main reformers were the intellectuals who advocated reforms of the social system of the Hindus in the light of modern knowledge.\n\nIt was spread to southern India by noted Telugu reformer and writer, Kandukuri Veeresalingam.\n\nOne of the greatest rationalist thinkers of modem India, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, also lived and worked in Maharashtra at this time.\n\n(2) ARYA SAMAJ BY SWAMI DAYANAND DAYANAND SARASWATI\nThe Arya Samaj undertook the task of reforming the Hindu religion in the west and north India.\nIt was founded in 1875 by Swami Dayanand Saraswati (1824-83).\nSwami Dayanand believed that selfish and ignorant priests had perverted Hindu religion with the aid of the Puranas which, he said, were full of false teachings.\nFor his own inspiration, Swami Dayanand went to the Vedas which he considered infallible, being the inspired word of God, and as the fountain of all knowledge.\nSome of Swami Dayanand\u2019s followers later started a network of school and colleges in the country to impart education on western lines. Lala Hansraj played a leading part in this effort.\nIn 1902, Swami Shradhananda started the Gurukul near Hardwar to propagate the more traditional ideals of education.\nOne of Arya Samaj\u2019s objectives was to prevent the conversion of Hindus to other religions. This led it to start a crusade against other religions. This crusade became a contributory factor in the growth of communalism in India in the 20th century.\nHindu Reform Movements in South India (Maharashtra)\n\nThe Theosophical Society was a major Hindu Reform movement with roots in Maharashtra.\n\nTHE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY BY MADAM H.P. BLAVATSKY AND COLONEL S. OLCOTT\nThe Theosophical Society was founded in the United States by Madam H.P. Blavatsky and Colonel S. Olcott, who later came to India and founded the headquarters of the Society at Adyar near Madras in 1886.\nThe Theosophist movement soon grew in India as a result of the leadership given to it by Mrs Annie Besant who had come to India in 1893.\nThe Theosophists advocated the revival and strengthening of the ancient religions of Hinduism, Zoroastrianism and Buddhism. They recognised the doctrine of the transmigration of the soul.\nOne of Mrs. Besant\u2019s many achievements in India was the establishment of the Central Hindu School at Banaras which was later developed by Madan Mohan Malaviya into the Benaras Hindu University.\nReligious reforms among Muslims\n\nThere were many prominent leaders like Sayyid Ahmed Khan and Muhammad Iqbal who influenced the Muslim population in India.\n\nSayyid Ahmad Khan and the Aligarh School\nThe most important reformer among the Muslims was Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817-98).\nIn his view, any interpretation of the Quran that conflicted with human reason, science, or nature was in reality a misinterpretation.\nAll his life he struggled against blind obedience to tradition, dependence on custom, ignorance and irrationalism.\nSayyid Ahmad Khan believed that the religious and social life of the Muslims could be improved only by imbibing modem western scientific knowledge and culture. Therefore promotion of modem education remained his priority throughout his life.\nIn 1875 he founded at Aligarh the Muhammedan Anglo-Oriental College as a centre for spreading western sciences and culture. Later, this College grew into the Aligarh Muslim University.\nSayyid Ahmad\u2019s reformist zeal also embraced the social sphere. He urged Muslims to give up medieval customs and ways of thought and behaviour.\nIn particular, he wrote in favour of raising women\u2019s status in society and advocated the removal of purdah and the spread of education among women.\nHe also condemned the customs of polygamy and easy divorce.\nHe opposed communal friction.\nAppealing to Hindus and Muslims to unite, he said in 1883, \u201cNow both of us live on the air of India, drink the holy waters of the Ganga and Yamuna. We both feed upon the products of the Indian soil.\u201d\nHowever, towards the end of his life, he began to talk of Hindu domination to prevent his followers from joining the rising national movement.\nMuhammad Iqbal (1876-1938)\nMuhammad Iqbal was one of the greatest poets of modem India.\nHe profoundly influenced the philosophical and religious outlook of the younger generation of Muslims as well as of Hindus.\nReligious Reforms among the Parsis\n\nThe prominent figures among Parsis include Naoroji Furdonji, Dadabhai Naoroji, S.S. Bengalee etc.\n\nRehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha or Religious Reform Association\n\nIn 1851, the Rehnumai Mazdayasan Sabha or Religious Reform Association was started by Naoroji Furdonji, Dadabhai Naoroji, S.S. Bengalee, and others.\n\nReligious Reforms among the Sikhs\n\nReligious reforms among the Sikhs started at the end of the 19th century when the Khalsa College was started at Amritsar. But the efforts gained momentum after 1920 when the Akali Movement arose in Punjab.\n\nAKALI MOVEMENT (PUNJAB)\nThe main aim of the Akalis was to purify the management of the gurudwaras or Sikh shrines. These gurudwaras had been heavily endowed with land and money by devout Sikhs.\nThe Sikh masses led by the Akalis started a powerful satyagraha against the mahants and the Government which aided them (1921).\nSocial reform movements to uplift women and backward castes\n\nThe major effect of national awakening in the 19th century was seen in the field of social reform. The newly educated persons increasingly revolted against rigid social conventions and outdated customs.\n\nIn the 20th century, and especially after 1919, the national movement became the main propagator of social reform.\n\nIncreasingly, the reformers took recourse to propaganda in the Indian language to reach the masses.\n\nThey also used novels, dramas, poetry, short stories, the Press and, in the thirties, the cinema to spread their views.\n\nThe social reform movements tried in the main to achieve two objectives (1) emancipation of women and extension of equal rights to them and (2) removal of caste rigidities and in particular the abolition of untouchability.\n\nMovements to uplift Women\n\nEmancipation means being free from restraint, control, or the power of another.\n\nIt is true that occasionally women of the character and personality of Razia Sultana, Chand Bibi, or Ahilyabai Holkar arose in India. But they were exceptions to the general pattern, and do not in any way change the picture.\n\nAfter the 1880s, when Dufferin hospitals (named after Lady Dufferin, the wife of the Viceroy) were started, efforts were made to make modern medicine and child delivery techniques available to Indian women.\n\nWomen played an active and important role in the struggle for freedom.\n\nThey participated in large numbers in the agitation against the partition of Bengal and in the Home Rule movement.\n\nSarojini Naidu, the famous poetess, became the president of the National Congress. Several women became ministers or parliamentary secretaries in the popular ministries of 1937.\n\nThey started many organisations and institutions for this purpose, the most outstanding of which was the All India Women\u2019s Conference founded in 1927.\n\nThe Hindu Succession Act of 1956 made the daughter an equal co-heir with the son.\n\nThe Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 permitted the dissolution of marriage on specific grounds.\n\nMovements to uplift Backward Caste\n\nThe caste system was another major target of attack for the social reform movement. The Hindus were at this time divided into numerous castes.\n\nThe untouchables suffered from numerous and severe disabilities and restrictions. He could not enter the Hindu temples or study the shastras. In some parts of the country, particularly in the south, their very shadow was to be avoided.\n\nAn untouchable\u2019s dress, food, place of residence, all were carefully regulated. He could not draw water from wells and tanks used by the higher castes; he could do so only from wells and tanks specially reserved for untouchables.\n\nIn modern India, it became a major obstacle to the growth of a united-nation-feeling and the spread of democracy.\n\nHowever, the British rule had many elements which gradually undermined the caste system.\n\nThe urbanisation and the introduction of modem industries, railways and buses made it difficult to prevent mass contact among persons of different castes, especially in the cities. Modem commerce and industry opened new fields of economic activity to all.\n\nThe growth of the national movement too played a significant role in weakening the caste system.\n\nLeaders like Gandhi kept the abolition of untouchability at the forefront of all public activities.\n\nIn 1932, Gandhiji founded the All India Harijan Sangh for the purpose. His campaign for the \u201croot and branch removal of untouchability\u201d was based on the grounds of humanism and reason.\n\nIn Maharashtra, Jyotiba Phule led a lifelong movement against Brahmanical religious authority as part of his struggle against upper caste domination.\n\nB.R. Ambedkar, who belonged to one of the scheduled castes, devoted his entire life to fighting against caste tyranny,\n\nHe organised the All India Scheduled Castes Federation for the purpose. Several other scheduled caste leaders founded the All India Depressed Classes Association.\n\nIn Kerala, Sri Narayan Guru organised a lifelong struggle against the caste system.\n\nThe Indian Constitution, in 1950, provided the legal framework for the final abolition of untouchability.\n\nRead:\u00a0Vaikom satyagraha\n\nThe Impact of Socio-Religious Movements on Indians\n\nThere were positive and negative impacts of the socio-religious movements in India.\n\nThe positive aspects of the socio-religious movements in India\n\nThe religious reform movements of modem times had an underlying unity. Most of them were based on the twin doctrines of Reason (Rationalism) and Humanism, though they also sometimes tended to appeal to faith and ancient authority to bolster their appeal.\n\nThey opposed the ritualistic, superstitious, irrational and obscurantist elements in Indian religion.\n\nSwami Vivekananda once said: \u201cIs religion to justify itself by the discoveries of reason through which every science justifies itself\u201d\n\nJustice Ranade came to the conclusion that society as a living organism is constantly changing and can never go back to the past.\n\nThe best of reformers argued that modem ideas and culture could be best imbibed by integrating them into Indian cultural streams.\n\nThe religious reform movements helped many Indians to come to terms with the modem world. These movements led to the emergence of Indian nationalism and eventually the freedom struggle.\n\nThe negative aspects of the socio-religious movements in India\n\nTwo negative aspects of the religious reform movements may also be noted.\n\n(1) Firstly, all of them catered to the needs of a small percentage of the population-the urban middle and upper classes.\n\n(2) The second limitation, which later became a major negative factor, was the tendency to look backwards, appeal to past greatness, and rely on scriptural authority. Appeals to past greatness created false pride and smugness, while the habit of finding a \u2018Golden Age\u2019 in the past acted as a check on the full acceptance of modem science and hampered the effort to improve the present.\n\nThe evil aspects of this phenomenon became apparent when it was found that, along with a rapid rise of national consciousness, another consciousness \u2013 communal consciousness \u2013 had begun to rise among the middle classes.\n\nMany other factors were certainly responsible for the birth of communalism in modem times; but undoubtedly, the nature of the religious reform movements also contributed to it.\n\nLearn more\n\nThis article is the 5th part of the article series on Modern Indian History.
